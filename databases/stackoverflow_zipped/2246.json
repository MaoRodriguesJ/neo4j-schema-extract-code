Unfortunately it seems VS sets a timeout to send this file, so if it is too big or your connection is too slow in upload the publishing fails because it doesn&#39;t finish before the timeout :( \r\n\r\nThere are other ways to send the zip without VS, if you want to learn details see the link below, otherwise TL;DR just follow my simple instructions already tested below the link\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/deployment-zip-push\r\n\r\nI used the curl command and it works for me, no timeout. You can try also powershell or AZ cli but curl is really easy, just be careful to get right uid/pwd the uid in my case was &quot;$&quot;+&quot;project_name&quot; \r\nhere is an example, replace params with yours\r\n\r\n    curl -X POST -u your_username:your_password --data-binary @&quot;your_zip_path&quot; https://your_project_name.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/zipdeploy\r\n\r\n\r\nBe patient and wait till the end the upload, there is no progress bar, see network activity, if it&#39;s sending data the upload is in progress. You find all the params inside the publishing file you can download from azure, they are also in VS. For the zip file you can use the one VS wasn&#39;t unable to deploy, Vs does not remove it, in my case it was under the proj dir in obj\\Release\\netcoreapp2.1\\PubTmp\r\n\r\nP.S I have WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE set to 1 this setting is recommended to 1 by many ms doc, so be careful changing to 0, you might have side effects.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006236/cannot-publish-to-azure-functions-from-visual-studio-2019/58044154#58044154","title":"Cannot publish to Azure Functions from Visual Studio 2019"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12023558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5a43db6ad4544fc3467bc39729badd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Farnaby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12023558/steve-farnaby"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569100843,"creation_date":1568879469,"question_id":58006236,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006236","body_markdown":"Previously I was able to publish to Azure Functions from Visual Studio but recently I always get an error saying that publish encountered an error.

As a result, when there are 10k training examples in the dataset, the number of files to be loaded is 60k.\r\n\r\nAfter the arrays are loaded using `tuple(np.load(item) for item in all_files)`, I need to perform three `numpy` operations which are:\r\n\r\n 1. `vstack`, for a tuple consists of 10k ndarrays with shape (1000, 92, 50).\r\n 2. `concatenate`, for a tuple consists of 10k 1darrays of various lengths.\r\n 3. Apply advanced slicing to the vectorized tuples of `numpy` arrays.\r\n\r\nBy testing the script, I found a problem: the amount of memory under `buff/cache` can be 2 times larger than the `used` memory (I ran the script on a slurm cluster, each compute node has 128Gb memory), As a result, when I reach the third step, I will receive memory error. \r\n\r\nInformed by this [answer][1], I use a separate script (at the end of this script I add `sys.exit()`) for `loading + vectorizing` the `numpy` arrays while keeping the step of `advanced slicing` in the original script. \r\n\r\nThe vectorized arrays will be saved to disk first, then they will be loaded by the original script for advanced slicing. This solves my problem, but I think it is not so elegant.\r\n\r\nAre there better solutions? What is the large memory under `buff/cache` used for when I load `numpy` arrays using `tuple(np.load(item) for item in all_files)`?

on the valuable input of Insane, I came up with the following two cleaner fixes:\r\n\r\n# Code-behind solution\r\n\r\nIn the `PersonView`, use the `ItemClick` event handler on the `Print` button:\r\n```\r\n&lt;dxb:BarButtonItem x:Name=&quot;bbiPrint&quot;\r\n  Content=&quot;{Binding Print, Source={StaticResource CommonResources}}&quot; \r\n  ItemClick=&quot;OnPrintBtnClick&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\nAdapt the corresponding code-behind file like this:\r\n```\r\npublic partial class PersonView : UserControl\r\n{\r\n  readonly IPrintService _printService;\r\n\r\n  public PersonView(IPrintService printService)\r\n  {\r\n    _printService = printService;\r\n\r\n    InitializeComponent();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void OnPrintBtnClick(object sender, ItemClickEventArgs e)\r\n  {\r\n    _printService.ShowGridViewPrintPreview(CardUserControl.PersonsCardView);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecause I want to gray-out the Print button when there is no selection, I still need to add some code to make that happen. I can get it by \r\n1. updating the button code to\r\n```\r\n&lt;dxb:BarButtonItem x:Name=&quot;bbiPrint&quot;\r\n  Content=&quot;{Binding Print, Source={StaticResource CommonResources}}&quot; \r\n  ItemClick=&quot;OnPrintBtnClick&quot; IsEnabled=&quot;{Binding CanPrintPersons}&quot;/&gt; \r\n```\r\n2. refreshing the `CanPrintPersons` property in the `PersonViewModel` upon Persons selection change\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it. \r\n\r\n# CardViewModel solution \r\n\r\nIn that solution, we have a `PersonView` with its underlying `PersonViewModel` and a `CardView` with its underlying `CardViewModel`. I will not describe that solution with all the details as it is overkill in my situation but for the sake of completeness, I&#39;ll give the main points. Upon clicking the `Print` button on the `PersonView`, the `PersonViewModel`&#39;s `PrintCommand` is called. That command emits a `Print` event to the `CardViewModel` which in turn calls its own `PrintCommand`. That latter command calls \r\n```\r\n_printService.ShowGridViewPrintPreview(View);\r\n```\r\nwhere the `View` is a `CardViewModel`&#39;s property that is set upon `CardView` loading with e.g. \r\n```\r\n&lt;dxmvvm:Interaction.Behaviors&gt;\r\n  &lt;dxmvvm:EventToCommand EventName=&quot;Loaded&quot; Command=&quot;{Binding ViewLoadedCommand}&quot; CommandParameter=&quot;{Binding ElementName=PersonsCardView}&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/dxmvvm:Interaction.Behaviors&gt;\r\n```\r\nBecause I have two child views I want to print, I&#39;d need to add a view model for each one of those. In addition, those two view models plus the `PersonViewModel` need access to the list of Persons to be printed. In particular, they need a shared access to the same data, so that they are synchronized. A simple way to do that is explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12430434/sharing-collection-between-viewmodels) and is totally doable. But I think it is not worth the trouble for the simple use case I have as it adds more complexity than necessary.

How do I pass `CardUserControl.PersonsCardView` in my `MyViews.PersonView` xaml above, how do I pass that `PersonCardView` to my command? In other words, how do I fix\r\n```\r\nCommandParameter=&quot;{Binding PersonsCardView, ElementName=CardUserControl}&quot;\r\n```\r\nto make it work? \r\n\r\nCurrently, the only solution I&#39;ve found to this problem is to replace the `Command` and `CommandParameter` with \r\n```\r\nItemClick=&quot;OnPrintBtnClick&quot;\r\n```\r\nand then in the `PersonView`&#39;s code-behind file to do:\r\n```\r\nprivate void OnPrintBtnClick(object sender, ItemClickEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n  var ctxt = DataContext as PersonViewModel;\r\n  ctxt.PrintPersonsCommand.Execute(CardUserControl.PersonsCardView);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThat works but I can&#39;t believe there is no other way. I&#39;m not happy with that solution because I don&#39;t have the benefits of using the `Command` any more, like e.g. the automatic evaluation of the Command&#39;s `CanExecute` method. I could also put the `CardView`&#39;s xaml code in the `PersonView.xaml` but I like my controls to be in separate files because I have the feeling it&#39;s more structured and each user control has its own responsibilities which can nicely be split into separate files. Also, that solution binds my view to my view model too tightly.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me out please?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006196/how-can-i-bind-a-commandparameter-with-a-child-usercontrols-child-element","title":"How can I bind a CommandParameter with a child UserControl&#39;s child element?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pycharm","portable-applications"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":11895782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaT9tmKshLY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJI/MafLaF4QbFQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kostas Charitidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11895782/kostas-charitidis"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568879554,"post_id":58006195,"comment_id":102417216,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006195/is-there-an-easy-way-to-put-my-entire-installation-of-pycharm-and-winpython-on-a#comment102417216_58006195"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":10058198,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5032aee7f90b4e96c71c22c597575a69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Emmi Starr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10058198/emmi-starr"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":11895782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaT9tmKshLY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJI/MafLaF4QbFQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kostas Charitidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11895782/kostas-charitidis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568881093,"post_id":58006195,"comment_id":102417935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006195/is-there-an-easy-way-to-put-my-entire-installation-of-pycharm-and-winpython-on-a#comment102417935_58006195"},{"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":11895782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaT9tmKshLY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJI/MafLaF4QbFQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kostas Charitidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11895782/kostas-charitidis"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568881296,"post_id":58006195,"comment_id":102418037,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006195/is-there-an-easy-way-to-put-my-entire-installation-of-pycharm-and-winpython-on-a#comment102418037_58006195"},{"owner":{"reputation":992,"user_id":3140336,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35a6c551352f918dcc8bab2ec13ae04d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"stonebig","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3140336/stonebig"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569267133,"post_id":58006195,"comment_id":102533794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006195/is-there-an-easy-way-to-put-my-entire-installation-of-pycharm-and-winpython-on-a#comment102533794_58006195"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":11931195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fvqJl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JLT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11931195/jlt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568881463,"creation_date":1568881463,"answer_id":58006748,"question_id":58006195,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006748","body_markdown":"As the comments say you should download the portable versions.

Have some sort of database (it can be a file system, it doesn&#39;t need to be a full-fledged SQL database) hold and manage the created tokens.  Without a database to validate the tokens against the current expected values, any kind of token based security (JWT or otherwise) will be useless, as you can&#39;t determine if the token is currently valid.\r\n\r\nCredential reuse (the replay of should-be-expired credentials) is a major security hole.  All one needs to do is obtain the token, and then all future communications are accepted with the same credentials.  This is closed by holding the tokens in a database, and expiring the tokens after some time by removing the tokens from the database.  This means that any possible breach is limited to a shorter time span.\r\n\r\nWithout any kind of database, I can only guess that you might be permitting any access with an existing token, meaning that all your tokens are effectively valid forever, as they will be accepted if they exist.  You need to possibly modify, and certainly validate, that expired tokens don&#39;t grant access to the controlled operations.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006186/mqtt-broker-with-tls-and-jwt/58157921#58157921","title":"MQTT Broker with TLS and JWT"}],"owner":{"reputation":391,"user_id":7894245,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1196c3771f69475188818ca9c09ce796?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7894245/david"},"last_editor":{"reputation":391,"user_id":7894245,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1196c3771f69475188818ca9c09ce796?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7894245/david"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58157921,"answer_count":3,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569780595,"creation_date":1568879297,"last_edit_date":1569189994,"question_id":58006186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006186","body_markdown":"We are currently working on a data-backup kinda project.

Then the JButton ActionListener will use this variable in the calculation.\r\n\r\nSo where you define the buttons you define the variable:\r\n\r\n    private couble expenseTax;\r\n\r\nIn the JRadioButton listeners you then use:\r\n\r\n    //double expenseTax = 1000;\r\n    expenseTax = 1000;\r\n\r\nAnd finally in the JButton ActionListener you use:\r\n\r\n    //double expenseTax = 0;\r\n    double totalTax = totalIncome - expenseTax;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006157/different-action-depending-on-what-radio-button-is-chosen/58013417#58013417","title":"Different Action depending on what radio button is chosen"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12061546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc4b9b5e79b6d8c3382376f364a11165?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Daniel Wong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061546/daniel-wong"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568903595,"creation_date":1568879196,"question_id":58006157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006157","body_markdown":"```\r\nclass personalFrame {\r\n\r\n    JTextField totalIncome = new JTextField(10);\r\n    private JFrame frame3 = new JFrame(&quot;Personal Tax Calculator&quot;);\r\n    JButton Calculate = new JButton(&quot;Calculate&quot;);\r\n     JRadioButton residentTax = new JRadioButton(&quot;Resident Tax&quot;);\r\n     JRadioButton nonresidentTax = new JRadioButton(&quot;Working Tax&quot;);\r\n     JRadioButton workingTax = new JRadioButton(&quot;Non-working Tax&quot;);\r\n\r\n    public personalFrame() {\r\n\r\n        frame3.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);\r\n        frame3.setSize(300, 100);\r\n        frame3.setVisible(true);\r\n        frame3.setLayout(new FlowLayout());\r\n\r\n        frame3.add(new JLabel(&quot;Total Income &quot;));\r\n        frame3.add(totalIncome);\r\n        frame3.add(Calculate);\r\n        frame3.add(residentTax);\r\n        frame3.add(nonresidentTax);\r\n        frame3.add(workingTax);\r\n        \r\n        Calculate.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {\r\n            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {\r\n\r\n                String Income = totalIncome.getText();\r\n                Double totalIncome = Double.parseDouble(Income);\r\n                double expenseTax = 0;\r\n                double totalTax = totalIncome - expenseTax;\r\n                String Tax = String.valueOf(totalTax);\r\n                JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, &quot;Tax payable is A$&quot; + Tax, &quot;Total tax&quot;, JOptionPane.INFORMATION_MESSAGE);\r\n\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n        });\r\n        \r\n           residentTax.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){\r\n            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ie){\r\n                double expenseTax = 1000;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n           \r\n           nonresidentTax.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){\r\n            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ie){\r\n                 double expenseTax = 1500;\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n           \r\n           workingTax.addActionListener(new ActionListener(){\r\n            public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ie){\r\n                 double expenseTax = 2000;\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above Code is for a Calculate Tax program im working on.

currently testing the Reinforcement Learning Toolbox in Matlab R2019a. Everything is working well so far, but I stumbled upon a question the documentation couldn&#39;t answer satisfyingly:\r\n\r\nWhen does the agent learn?\r\n\r\nThe documentation says about the minibatch-size\r\n&gt;During each training episode, the agent randomly samples experiences from the experience buffer when computing gradients for updating the actor and critic properties.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it is clarified nowhere what exactly is meant by &#39;training episode&#39;.\r\n\r\nDoese the train-function of the RL-Toolbox train the agent **at the end of an episode** or **during the episode when the step count exeeds the minibatch-size** (like in the baseline algorithms)?\r\n\r\nI have the following setup for the agent\r\n```matlab\r\nagentOptions = rlDQNAgentOptions(&#39;SampleTime&#39;,Ts,...\r\n                                 &#39;UseDoubleDQN&#39;,true,...\r\n                                 &#39;TargetSmoothFactor&#39;,1e-3,...\r\n                                 &#39;DiscountFactor&#39;,0.99,...\r\n                                 &#39;NumStepsToLookAhead&#39;,4,...\r\n                                 &#39;ExperienceBufferLength&#39;,1e6,...\r\n                                 &#39;MiniBatchSize&#39;,120,...\r\n                                 &#39;ResetExperienceBufferBeforeTraining&#39;, false,...\r\n                                 &#39;SaveExperienceBufferWithAgent&#39;,true);\r\n```\r\nwith Ts = 0.25.\r\nThe length of one episode is set to 2000 steps, because the agent is there to learn his behaviour in a long-running process. It is not possible to make the episodes shorter because otherwise the agent would not meet all the interesting states.\r\n\r\nCould maybe someone enlighten me or provide me with a hint how I could double-check?\r\n\r\nI had the idea to monitor the epsilon-decay (which occurs after every training), but I have no idea how to do this in a closed fast-restart loop (which already blocks me off from opening another .m-file).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006123/when-does-an-agent-learn-in-the-matalb-reinforcement-learning-toolbox","title":"When does an agent learn in the Matalb Reinforcement Learning Toolbox?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","pivot-table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3342,"user_id":11232091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IODdK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"moys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11232091/moys"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568879585,"post_id":58006119,"comment_id":102417228,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006119/how-to-include-the-blank-column-to-pandas-pivot-table#comment102417228_58006119"},{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":11906428,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9adEP8MXLAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHU/Hym2ZvbvsoM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Praveen Snowy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11906428/praveen-snowy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3342,"user_id":11232091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IODdK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"moys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11232091/moys"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568879671,"post_id":58006119,"comment_id":102417286,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006119/how-to-include-the-blank-column-to-pandas-pivot-table#comment102417286_58006119"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":11906428,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9adEP8MXLAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHU/Hym2ZvbvsoM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Praveen Snowy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11906428/praveen-snowy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568882220,"post_id":58006404,"comment_id":102418489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006119/how-to-include-the-blank-column-to-pandas-pivot-table/58006404#comment102418489_58006404"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":423560,"user_id":2901002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMDvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jezrael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2901002/jezrael"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568880116,"creation_date":1568880116,"answer_id":58006404,"question_id":58006119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006404","body_markdown":"For me working change values of `Comment` after `pivot_table`, because if use before, column is dropped:\r\n\r\n    data_frame1 = pd.pivot_table(data_frame, index=[&#39;PC&#39;, &#39;Geo&#39;, &#39;Comp&#39;], \r\n                                 values=[&#39;Bill1&#39;, &#39;Bill2&#39;, &#39;Comment&#39;], \r\n                                 columns=[&#39;Month&#39;], \r\n                                 fill_value=0)\r\n    \r\n    data_frame1 = data_frame1.swaplevel(0,1, axis=1).sort_index(axis=1)\r\n    \r\n    mask = data_frame1.columns.get_level_values(1) == &#39;Comment&#39;\r\n    data_frame1.loc[:, mask] = &#39;&#39;\r\n    print (data_frame1)\r\n    Month       01/10/2019               01/11/2019               01/12/2019  \\\r\n                     Bill1 Bill2 Comment      Bill1 Bill2 Comment      Bill1   \r\n    PC Geo Comp                                                                \r\n    A  Ind OS            1  1.28                  1  1.28                  1   \r\n    \r\n    Month                      \r\n                Bill2 Comment  \r\n    PC Geo Comp                \r\n    A  Ind OS    1.28          ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006119/how-to-include-the-blank-column-to-pandas-pivot-table/58006404#58006404","title":"how to Include the blank column to Pandas pivot table"}],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":11906428,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9adEP8MXLAQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHU/Hym2ZvbvsoM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Praveen Snowy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11906428/praveen-snowy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58006404,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568880116,"creation_date":1568879063,"question_id":58006119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006119","body_markdown":"I have a dataframe which has a column &#39;Comment&#39;

For this reason, you should only use the `position` parameter while acquiring the related data item inside this method and should not keep a copy of it. **If you need the position of an item later on (e.g. in a click listener), use `getAdapterPosition()` which will have the updated adapter position**. Override `onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder, int, List)` instead if Adapter can handle efficient partial bind.\r\n\r\nSo change the implementation of your `setOnClickListener()` method so it does not use the parametere `position`, but calls `getAdapterPosition()` instead to acquire the fresh value of your position.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v7/widget/RecyclerView.Adapter.html#onBindViewHolder(VH,%20int)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006058/array-deletion-taking-place-from-the-lower-index-first/58007039#58007039","title":"Array deletion taking place from the lower index first?"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":10999102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Bd6qGYoU4d4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQMdIJ24oyiDzKOov4IR958DBba0UA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aparna Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10999102/aparna-sharma"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2641,"user_id":4636715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ebd8c54bb287f99b94373429b588e21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vahdet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4636715/vahdet"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568882510,"creation_date":1568878842,"last_edit_date":1568878979,"question_id":58006058,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58006058","body_markdown":"My app is in the foreground. and there are 2 items into a recyclerview list. whenever I delete my 2nd item from the list and after that click on the 1st item my app gets crash. and in Logcat I get the error like - `java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 1, Size: 1`.

created simple files with 3 lines each. \r\n\r\nMy solution is:\r\n\r\n     with open(&quot;file 1.txt&quot;, &#39;r&#39;) as f1, open(&quot;file 2.txt&quot;, &#39;r&#39;) as f2,open(&quot;file 3.txt&quot;, &#39;r&#39;) as f3:\r\n\t    with open(&quot;outfile.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;) as o:\r\n\r\n\t\t   files    = [f1,&#39;b&#39;,f2,&#39;b&#39;,f3]\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t   for i in files:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t   if i != &#39;b&#39;:\r\n\t\t\t\t  lines = i.readlines()\r\n\t\t\t   else:\r\n\t\t\t\t  lines = &#39;\\n&#39;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t   o.writelines(lines)\r\n\r\nThe explanation:\r\n\r\nAll the files to be reading are writting upon a single sentence &quot;with open (file_name,&#39;r&#39;)&quot;. The &#39;r&#39; stands for reading.\r\n\r\nThe output file is in the next sentence &#39;with open(&quot;outfile.txt&quot;, &#39;w&#39;)&#39;\r\n\r\nThen a list was created with the variable names of the files and the letter &quot;b&quot; inbetween them. The &#39;b&#39; was placed on purpose, because a matter of format. \r\n\r\nWhen the &quot;loop for&quot; finds a file (f1,f2,f3) it gets the lines of the files. Otherwise it gets a &#39;b&#39; and add a line break.\r\n\r\nAt end of the process everything is written in outfile.txt, which variable name is &#39;o&#39;, following the order of the files and lines inside the files. \r\n\r\nWithout the &#39;b&#39; the output file would be written like this:\r\n\r\n    file 1 line 1\r\n    file 1 line 2\r\n    file 1 line 3file 2 line 1\r\n    file 2 line 2\r\n    file 2 line 3file 3 line 1\r\n    file 3 line 2\r\n    file 3 line 3\r\n\r\nWith the code I posted it prints this way:\r\n\r\n    f  = open(&quot;outfile.txt&quot;,&#39;r&#39;)\r\n    print(f.read())\r\n\r\n    file 1 line 1\r\n    file 1 line 2\r\n    file 1 line 3\r\n    file 2 line 1\r\n    file 2 line 2\r\n    file 2 line 3\r\n    file 3 line 1\r\n    file 3 line 2\r\n    file

to give people more ideas (for example, how not to call `setup` in every test), one additional thing you could do is to write a helper like this:\r\n\r\n    fn run_test&lt;T&gt;(test: T) -&gt; ()\r\n        where T: FnOnce() -&gt; () + panic::UnwindSafe\r\n    {\r\n        setup();    \r\n        let result = panic::catch_unwind(|| {\r\n            test()\r\n        });    \r\n        teardown();    \r\n        assert!(result.is_ok())\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, in your own tests you would use it like this:\r\n\r\n    #[test]\r\n    fn test() {\r\n        run_test(|| {\r\n            let ret_value = function_under_test();\r\n            assert!(ret_value);\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can read more about `UnwindSafe` trait and `catch_unwind` here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/panic/fn.catch_unwind.html\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found the original idea of this test helper in [this medium article](https://medium.com/@ericdreichert/test-setup-and-teardown-in-rust-without-a-framework-ba32d97aa5ab) by Eric Opines.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is [rstest](https://github.com/la10736/rstest) crate which has [pytest-like](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) fixtures which you can use as a setup code (combined with the [Jussi Kukkonen&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58006287/3606603):\r\n\r\n    use std::sync::Once; \r\n    use rstest::rstest;\r\n    static INIT: Once = Once::new();\r\n    \r\n    pub fn setup() -&gt; () { \r\n        INIT.call_once(|| {\r\n            // initialization code here\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    #[rstest]\r\n    fn should_success(setup: ()) {\r\n        // do your test\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMaybe one day rstest will gain scopes support and `Once` won&#39;t be needed anymore.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58006033/how-to-run-setup-code-before-any-tests-run-in-rust/58009990#58009990","title":"How to run setup code before any tests run in
