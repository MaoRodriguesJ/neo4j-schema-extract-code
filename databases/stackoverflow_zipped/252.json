Sounds simple, but there&#39;s a twist.\r\n\r\n- I have one table that has Company IDs, and defines Companies.\r\n- I have another table that defines Departments in those companies.\r\n- I have a third table that contains the various Department StatusCodes.\r\n\r\nThe code that I have below works just fine, and is exactly what I want it to do. But I have to hardcode into the query which departments to look for.  I&#39;d like it to sub-select based on department codes it finds in the Departments table, and not require me to hard code each possible department that might exist at that company.\r\n\r\nI need to select the matching department status from DepartmentStatus based upon what Departments exist for a company as defined in DepartmentsStatus table.\r\n\r\nI suspect it&#39;s a pivot table, but they are a bit above my level.\r\n\r\n(Company Table)\r\n\r\n    Company_ID\tCompany_Name\r\n    -------------------------\r\n    1\t\tHome Office\r\n    2\t\tStanton Office\r\n    3\t\tNYC Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Departments Table)\r\n\r\n    CompanyID  \tDepartment_Code\r\n    ----------------------------\r\n    1\t\t\tSales\r\n    1\t\t\tInventory\r\n    1\t\t\tRetail\r\n    1\t\t\tMaint\r\n    \r\n    2\t\t\tOtherDept\r\n    2\t\t\tThatDept\r\n    2\t\t\tBobsDept\r\n\r\n\r\n(DepartmentStatus Table)\r\n\r\n    Company_ID\tDepartment\tStatusCode\r\n    -----------------------------------------\r\n    1\t\t\tSales\t\tInReview\r\n    1\t\t\tInventory\tInReview\r\n    1\t\t\tRetail\t\tReady\r\n    1\t\t\tMaint\t\tDone\r\n    2\t\t\tOtherDept\tInReview\r\n    2\t\t\tThatDept\tResearch\r\n    2\t\t\tBobsDept\tInReview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Note: I use &quot;TOP 1&quot;, even though there is a unique index on Company_ID+Department, so there will never be more than one matching row.*\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, for Company_ID=1:\r\n\r\n    select\tCompany_ID,  \r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.Company_ID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;Sales&#39;) as SalesStatus\r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.Company_ID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;Inventory&#39;) as InvStatus\r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.Company_ID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;Retail&#39;) as RetailStatus\r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.Company_ID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;Main&#39;) as MaintStatus\r\n    from \tCompany cm\r\n    Where \tcm.CompanyID=1\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n    Company_ID\t \tSalesStatus \tInvStatus\tRetailStatus\tMaintStatus\r\n    ---------------\t---------------\t----------\t-------------\t------------\r\n    1\t\t\t\tInReview\t\tInReview\tReady\t\t\tDone\r\n\r\nOr, for CompanyID=2:\r\n\r\n    select\tCompany_ID,  \r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.CompanyID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;OtherDept&#39;) as OtherDeptStatus\r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.CompanyID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;ThatDept&#39;) as ThatDeptStatus\r\n    \t\t(select top 1 StatusCode from DepartmentStatus ds where ds.CompanyID = cm.Company_ID and ds.Department=&#39;BobsDept&#39;) as BobsDeptStatus\r\n    from \tCompany cm\r\n    Where \tcm.CompanyID=2\r\n\r\nResults: \r\n\r\n    Company_ID\tOtherDeptStatus\t\tThatDeptStatus\t\tBobsDeptStatus\r\n    ----------\t----------------\t--------------\t\t--------------\r\n    2\t\t\tInReview\t\t\tResearch\t\t\tInReview\r\n\r\nThus, For Company 1, I need to go get the status for Departments Sales, Inventory, Retail, and Maint.\r\nBut for Company 2, I need to get the status for Departments OtherDept, ThatDept, and BobsDept.\r\n\r\nThe steps that I think describe what I am trying to do is:\r\n\r\n1. Get list of Departments for Company 1 from Departments Table.\r\n2. For each of these Departments in Step 1, query DepartmentStatus table for Department equals that department.\r\n\tFor Company 1, query get StatusCode for Departments &quot;Sales, Inventory, Retail, and Maint&quot;\r\n\tFor Company 2, query get StatusCode for Departments &quot;OtherDept, thatDept, and BobsDept.&quot;\r\n\tetc etc\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe problem is, I do not know ahead of time (at query time) which departments exist for each Company, so I need to sub-select based upon what departments actually exist for each company.\r\n\r\nThere are a few other S.O. answers already that are close what I&#39;m asking for, suggesting the use of a JOIN to accomplish this, however, they all assume that you know the values you want to query ahead of time when writing the join statement.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking for a solution to this problem, not just a correction on my current attempt.  If you have a better idea entirely on how to accomplish this, I&#39;d love to see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476588/select-rows-in-one-table-based-on-column-values-in-another-table","title":"Select rows in one table, based on column values in another table?"},{"tags":["php","codeigniter","email","smtp","phpmailer"],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10391067,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de0abfe4e5d4c2078906a7538d7dd526?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tanmay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10391067/tanmay"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10391067,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de0abfe4e5d4c2078906a7538d7dd526?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tanmay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10391067/tanmay"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571600337,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571600270,"creation_date":1571600012,"last_edit_date":1571600270,"question_id":58476581,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476581","body_markdown":"I&#39;m getting some error *fsockopen(): php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known* when sending mail using phpmailer.\r\n\r\nI have two domains.

need to pin a static value-type field in memory, and I need the pin to be long-term, i.e. using a pinned `GCHandle` (or equivalent), **not** a pinned local variable (e.g. `fixed` blocks in C# or `pin_ptr` in C++/CLI)\r\n\r\nI&#39;m going crazy figuring this out, and I can&#39;t accept it isn&#39;t possible\r\n\r\nSo, I can pin a value type static field locally to a function, using `fixed`/`pin_ptr`, but I lose the pin when the function returns\r\n\r\nWith a `GCHandle` of type `GCHandleType.Pinned`, I can pin objects for as long as I like, but it only works on objects, reference types. I know value type static fields are internally stored as boxes (e: seems this only applies to non-primitive types, and I&#39;m dealing with primitives), but I can&#39;t get a reference to the internal box object: if I pass the field to `GCHandle`, I create a new box from the current value of the field\r\n\r\nFrom reading on .NET internals, I know that statics are stored inside assembly objects, which used to be non-GC and guaranteed to stay fixed in memory. But assemblies have been made collectible in recent versions of Core and Framework, and I don&#39;t know if this still applies (probably not, or we wouldn&#39;t need `FixedAddressValueTypeAttribute`)\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t mark the field as `[FixedAddressValueType]`, because it&#39;s in a third-party assembly that I can&#39;t replace or modify\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up: I can pin anything, as long as I do it locally to a function. I can pin non-locally, but only if I have a reference to an object. Value type static fields *are* wrapped in an object, but I can&#39;t get a reference to it. Is there any hope of achieving this, ideally not relying on implementation-specific internals, or it&#39;s simply unsupported?\r\n\r\n(... and to make it even harder, *ideally*, I need to do it from unmanaged code, using the native COM APIs.

Set this fork as the `remote` for the project you have on your computer (the clone you made from the original project and on which you worked)\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd &lt;path-to-your-local-repository&gt;\r\ngit remote add origin &lt;address-of-your-fork&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Fetch the content of that fork (to get updates that were made in the original project since you cloned it)\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit fetch\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Merge what you fetched with your local project\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit merge origin/master\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that steps 3 and 4 can be achieved in one command with: `git pull`.\r\n\r\n5. Push to origin (this will push your local work to your fork)\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit push -u origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Replace `master` by the name of your branch if you are working on a brach).\r\n\r\n6.

When I add a new timer, it both creates html to show the timer  and sends out an Ajax put request to create the timer record on the server. then when the Ajax call completes I use the record id in the response and input that into the html. I have programming set up where if I click start on any timer, it will stop any running clock by taking the record of that clock and sending it to the server. I need to handle the situation for when someone clicks stop on a timer while a newly added timer is waiting for the record id from the server. I looked into ajaxComplete, but I am hoping for something more direct instead of a catch all for all running Ajax requests. I don’t think Promise.all() can work because the programming to create and receive a record id is contained within its own function. I was hoping to do something similar to a Promise.all(ajaxOfPutRequest), but this ajaxOfPutRequest is called outside the stopTimer function. Here is the relevant code:\r\n``` js\r\n$(&#39;button&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function () {\r\n  var createRecord = () =&gt; {\r\n    $(this).parent().addClass(&#39;toggled&#39;)\r\n    //collect data from element\r\n    $.ajax({\r\n      url: url,\r\n      type: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n      headers: headers,\r\n      data: data,\r\n      success: function (response) {\r\n        $(this).attr(&#39;id&#39;, response.record.id)\r\n      },\r\n      error: function () {}\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n  createRecord()\r\n})\r\n\r\n$(&#39;stopTimerButton&#39;).on(&#39;click&#39;, function () {\r\n  var stopTimer = () =&gt; {\r\n    $(&#39;#&#39; + idOfRunningClock).each(function () {\r\n      //collect data\r\n      $.ajax({\r\n        url: url,\r\n        type: &#39;PUT&#39;,\r\n        headers: headers,\r\n        data: data,\r\n        success: function () {\r\n          Knack.hideSpinner();\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nSee how are the functions are separate? They don&#39;t stem from same eventListener, and I don&#39;t know how to make second function wait for first function to complete, since second function depends on data (the record Id) of the first function.

This, in turn, states\r\n\r\n&gt; Order the elements of properties so they are in the same relative order as would be produced by the Iterator that would be returned if the EnumerateObjectProperties internal method were invoked with O.\r\n\r\n[EnumerateObjectProperties](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-enumerate-object-properties) then says\r\n\r\n&gt; The mechanics and order of enumerating the properties is not specified but must conform to the rules specified below.\r\n\r\nand from the &quot;below&quot;, the following pieces are relevant to your question:\r\n\r\n&gt; - Returned property keys do not include keys that are Symbols.\r\n&gt; - A property name will be returned [...] at most once in any enumeration.\r\n\r\nSo, per spec, there are no real ordering guarantees at all for `Object.keys()`. Just some very basic invariants. \r\n\r\nThe same applies for other parts of the language that bottom out in EnumerateObjectProperties, notably `for`-`in`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nContrast this with [`Reflect.ownKeys()`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-reflect.ownkeys), which, at least for [ordinary objects](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinary-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots), bottoms out in [OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-ordinaryownpropertykeys). There, the order is\r\n\r\n&gt; - each own property key P of O that is an array index, in ascending numeric index order, do\r\n&gt; - each own property key P of O that is a String but is not an array index, in ascending chronological order of property creation\r\n&gt; - each own property key P of O that is a Symbol, in ascending chronological order of property creation\r\n\r\ni.e. for that method, there is a well-specified order. (The same applies to other methods that bottom out in OrdinaryOwnPropertyKeys, such as [`Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptors()`](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-object.getownpropertydescriptors).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is a [currently active proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-for-in-order) that attempts to specify stronger restrictions on EnumerateObjectProperties order, and thus on `for`-`in`. Its approach is to find scenarios involving a restricted prototype chain and enumeration, where nothing weird is going on, and picking the same order as `Reflect.ownKeys()` does, for each level in the prototype chain. My reading of the proposal is that, specifically applied to `Object.keys()`, it would make it behave the same as `Reflect.ownKeys()` on ordinary objects. [I&#39;ve opened an issue on the proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-for-in-order/issues/19) to see if I&#39;m correct, and if so to make that more explicit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476511/object-keys-ordering-standard/58477609#58477609","title":"Object.keys() ordering standard?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":10617101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d68c5f009a580a80065612a894c2477e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Malama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10617101/malama"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32,"user_id":10617101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d68c5f009a580a80065612a894c2477e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Malama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10617101/malama"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1571610880,"accepted_answer_id":58477609,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571773925,"creation_date":1571599445,"last_edit_date":1571609238,"question_id":58476511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476511","body_markdown":"What is the official ordering standard of `Object.keys()`?  \r\nThis is not a question over the ordering. It is a question over standard.\r\n\r\n`Kaushal Regmi` wrote:\r\n\r\n&gt; First, the keys that are integer indices in ascending numeric order.\r\nThen, all other string keys, in the order in which they were added to the object.\r\nLastly, all symbol keys, in the order in which they were added to the object.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/57929312/10617101\r\n\r\nSo far so good. Have a Object only integers as keys, there will be saved in ascending numeric order in the `Object.keys()` returned array. Are the keys only letters, the `Object.keys()` returned array have the same ordering as in the the called `object{}`. My question is: Is this a general and global standard in JavaScript? The question about this is: Is it safety?\r\n\r\nNext, there is a little problem with that. (i do not use it).\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar object = { 3a: &#39;z&#39;, 1a: &#39;x&#39;, 2a: &#39;y&#39; };\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; Object.keys(object).length; i++) {\r\nconsole.log(Object.keys(object)[i]);\r\n}\r\n// Firefox: SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal\r\n// Chrome: Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar object = { a3: &#39;z&#39;, a1: &#39;x&#39;, a2: &#39;y&#39; };\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; Object.keys(object).length; i++) {\r\nconsole.log(Object.keys(object)[i]);\r\n}\r\n// works on both: [a3, a1, a2]\r\n```\r\nYes, the solution is, use another method to create the `object{}`:  \r\n```\r\nvar object = {};\r\nobject[&quot;3a&quot;] = &#39;z&#39;;\r\nobject[&quot;1a&quot;] = &#39;x&#39;;\r\nobject[&quot;2a&quot;] = &#39;y&#39;;\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; Object.keys(object).length; i++) {\r\nconsole.log(Object.keys(object)[i]);\r\n}\r\n// [3a, 1a, 2a]\r\n```\r\nEDIT: The special problem are object keys as integers in quotes:\r\n```\r\nvar object = { &quot;3&quot;: &quot;z&quot;, &quot;1&quot;: &quot;x&quot;, &quot;2&quot;: &quot;y&quot; };\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; Object.keys(object).length; i++) {\r\nconsole.log(Object.keys(object)[i]);\r\n} // [1, 2, 3]\r\n```\r\nNormaly &quot;1&quot; is a string and 1 is a integer, but as object key &quot;1&quot; is still a integer. (but not realy by math with object keys).  \r\nAlso by the way therefore my question, what is the official standard in the order.

trying to improve the performance of an `Application` with multiple `Tableviews` that are constantly being updated. On each update only 1 item inside the `ObservableList` changes. The reloading of the rows of those `Tableviews` and applying css-styles to these rows are slowing down the application in a significant way.\r\n\r\nI looked at the way, that `Tableviews` are reloading their rows and realized that all rows are constantly being reconstructed from scratch independent of the type of change to the underlying `ObservableList`. The changing of 1 item inside the viewport / 1 item outside of the viewport / a complete replacement of the List causes the exact number of row constructions. \r\n\r\nIs there a way prevent the Javafx `Tableviews` from reloading all displayed `Rows`, when only certain `Items` change?\r\n\r\nOther possible tweaks to improve the performance of constantly reloading `Tableviews` would be greatly

it&#39;s about the first column, you can easily do it by defining one template (the explicit grid) to `1fr` and the implicit grid to `min-content`\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .box {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-auto-flow: column;\r\n      grid-template-columns:1fr;\r\n      grid-auto-columns:min-content;\r\n      margin:5px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    span {\r\n      border: 1px solid;\r\n      padding: 5px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div

&lt;span&gt;eeee&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nFor the last column you may need more *hacks* where we consider the same configuration but we move all the elements to *before* the implicit grid to keep the `1fr` the last. We need to use negative number combined with a random area to do this. ([more details about this trick here][1])\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only drawback is that you need to define all the grid-column but you don&#39;t need to know the number of column, only the max number (you can probably consider SASS to generate the rules)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .box {\r\n

Below is the code that does this:\r\n\r\nBaseMatSnackbar.cs (Note the comments are mine...)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n    [Parameter]\r\n            public bool IsOpen\r\n            {\r\n                get =&gt; _isOpen;\r\n                set\r\n                {\r\n                    // When the component is created the value of IsOpen is false \r\n                    // and the parameter value passed to it is also false, so the \r\n                    // code within the if block is not executed.\r\n                    if (IsOpen != value)\r\n                    {\r\n                        _isOpen = value;\r\n                        // After clicking the MatButton IsOpen != value, and thus \r\n                        // this code is executed by JavaScript to display the \r\n                        // component\r\n                        CallAfterRender(async () =&gt;\r\n                        {\r\n                            await JsInvokeAsync&lt;object&gt;(&quot;matBlazor.matSnackbar.setIsOpen&quot;, Ref, value);\r\n                        });\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nWhen you click the MatButton for the next time `IsOpen == value`, the above if block is not executed, the condition being `IsOpen != value`, in other words, why display the component if it is already displayed. \r\n\r\nNow, whenever, you hit the MatButton, the local variable is incremented, but the content of the MatSnackbarContent remains the same after the first click: &quot;Count: 1&quot;, in other words, the MatSnackbarContent component is not rerendered with the new value of count.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll post here some of the relevant code involved, and perhaps you can shed some new light about those components. I&#39;m not familiar with MatBlazor, and I&#39;d rather learn the core of Blazor first...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/SamProf/MatBlazor/blob/master/src/MatBlazor.Web/src/matSnackbar/matSnackbar.js\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SamProf/MatBlazor/blob/master/src/MatBlazor/Components/MatSnackbar/MatSnackbar.razor\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/SamProf/MatBlazor/blob/master/src/MatBlazor/Components/MatSnackbar/BaseMatSnackbar.cs\r\n\r\nHope this helps...\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476465/matsnackbar-not-updating-matsnackbarcontent/58489299#58489299","title":"MatSnackbar not updating MatSnackBarContent"}],"owner":{"reputation":1221,"user_id":5225272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e33ac8c6f539a6bce4fd3090c0e5c9d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Johan Donne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5225272/johan-donne"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571670931,"creation_date":1571599172,"question_id":58476465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476465","body_markdown":"In my code when opening a MatSnackBar multiple times the content that is displayed in the SnackBar does not update as I suppose it should. \r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    @page &quot;/&quot;\r\n \r\n        &lt;div&gt; count value: @count &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;MatButton OnClick=&quot;ButtonClick&quot;&gt;Open&lt;/MatButton&gt;\r\n        &lt;MatSnackbar @bind-IsOpen=&quot;@snackBarIsOpen&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;MatSnackbarContent&gt;Count: @count&lt;/MatSnackbarContent&gt;\r\n            &lt;MatSnackbarActions&gt;\r\n                &lt;MatButton Raised=&quot;true&quot; @onclick=&quot;() =&gt; { snackBarIsOpen = false; }&quot; &gt;Close&lt;/MatButton&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MatSnackbarActions&gt;\r\n        &lt;/MatSnackbar&gt;\r\n       \r\n        @code\r\n        {\r\n            bool snackBarIsOpen = false;\r\n            int count = 0;\r\n             \r\n            void ButtonClick()\r\n            {\r\n                snackBarIsOpen = true;\r\n                count++;\r\n                this.StateHasChanged();\r\n            } \r\n        }\r\n \r\n    \r\nWhen clicking multiple times on the button, the SnackBar always displays &quot;Count: 1&quot;.\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476465/matsnackbar-not-updating-matsnackbarcontent","title":"MatSnackbar not updating MatSnackBarContent"},{"tags":["sql","postgresql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17128,"user_id":1118978,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2rloq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Derviş Kayımbaşıoğlu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1118978/dervi%c5%9f-kay%c4%b1mba%c5%9f%c4%b1o%c4%9flu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571599306,"post_id":58476464,"comment_id":103285677,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476464/turn-lowercase-to-uppercase-and-viceversa#comment103285677_58476464"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571599474,"creation_date":1571599474,"answer_id":58476514,"question_id":58476464,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58476514","body_markdown":"Not using `regexp_replace()` seems highly curious.

The Express-based server-side web application will expose a REST API, that will be consumed by the Angular application, which in turn may make HTTP calls to external services.\r\n\r\nFor specific reasons, I need to distribute the two applications together. I also want to manage development of both applications as a single project. I have searched for good practices online, and I have seen several approaches, such as:\r\n\r\n* Serve the Angular application almost like a static set of files in a directory within the Node.js web application\r\n* Use a package like `concurrently` to run the Angular and Node.js applications simultaneously, by defining a script in the top-level folder&#39;s `package.json` file.\r\n\r\nI imagine there are multiple ways of achieving this, and I hope someone can share an approach on a well trodden path, using the same or similar stack.\r\n\r\n**Update Oct 21 2019** I want to provide some context on my specific requirement. I don&#39;t plan to host this on an external server. Ultimately, my goal is to create an Electron app that will encapsulate the front-end and the web application.

It will fail when `self[key]` doesn&#39;t return a dictionary. Presumably you want to have a base case to handle that:\r\n\r\n    def foo(self, key):\r\n        value = self[key]  # you might want a further base case to handle the key not existing at all!\r\n        if not isinstance(value, dict):\r\n            pass           # if you have something to do for the base case, do it here\r\n        else:              # recursive case\r\n            obj = Demo(value)\r\n            obj.foo(key)\r\n\r\nNow, this class is a bit silly, it copies lots of stuff just so that you can have a method that runs on a `dict`.

Unfortunately, Numpy has some limitations when calculating the exp of values higher than 709 (709.7827) or less than -745 (-745.133), and with the dataset, I got values of about 881.52149758 and -804.364266793 for the weighted-sum. Numpy produced this warning - RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp - and apparently, this is a limitation with Python. Try calculating the exp for 710 or -746, using Numpy or just Python.\r\n\r\nIn [this link][2] the author have a solution for his code.\r\n\r\nHow can I implement the solution to my code?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://medium.com/deepquestai/train-object-detection-ai-with-6-lines-of-code-6d087063f6ff\r\n  [2]: https://www.codementor.io/celisha-wigwe/artificial-intelligence-learning-to-model-a-neural-network-f80rcx2v9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476417/runtimewarning-overflow-encountered-in-exp-imageai","title":"RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp (imageai)"},{"tags":["wordpress"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2542,"user_id":9131961,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/64NdY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cabrerahector","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9131961/cabrerahector"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571600877,"post_id":58476413,"comment_id":103286014,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476413/wordpress-cli-giving-killed-message#comment103286014_58476413"},{"owner":{"reputation":2814,"user_id":41169,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUuMy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob Bowman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/41169/rob-bowman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2542,"user_id":9131961,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/64NdY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cabrerahector","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9131961/cabrerahector"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571601295,"post_id":58476413,"comment_id":103286136,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476413/wordpress-cli-giving-killed-message#comment103286136_58476413"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2814,"user_id":41169,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUuMy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rob Bowman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/41169/rob-bowman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571603547,"creation_date":1571603547,"answer_id":58477059,"question_id":58476413,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58477059","body_markdown":"So it seems the problem was due to import of one particular image.

That&#39;s the styles added to the element directly with `&lt;a style=&quot;display: block;&quot; /&gt;` or with Javascript `element.style.display = &quot;block&quot;;`, so the problem you are having is that you are receiving an `undefined` when accessing `style.display`, so your `style.display === &quot;block&quot; or &quot;none&quot;` will never be true. As a programmer **tip**, the first thing to do with that kind of problem is to put a `console.log` inside your `openModal` and `closeModal` functions to check if they are being called, and also check if the code is running as you expect. With a `console.log(model.style.display)` you will noticed that.\r\n\r\nTo get the computed CSS style, you must call `window.getComputedStyle(element);` ([DOC here](https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle)), but that&#39;s pretty CPU consuming and not so good practice actually when you have nice CSS, so the best way you can do is to assume an initial state (if there&#39;s no display state, then assume is `none`), or use classes (which is the way I recommend, from my experience), like so:\r\n\r\n    .modal {\r\n        display: none;\r\n        position: fixed;\r\n        &amp;-content {\r\n            display: block;\r\n            &amp;-close {\r\n                display: block;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        &amp;.shown { // Notice the shown class I added here\r\n            display: block;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen you can add or remove the `.shown` class to the modal, and it will hide and show on your convenience:\r\n\r\n    const openModal = () =&gt; {\r\n        if(!modal.classList.contains(&quot;shown&quot;)) {\r\n            modal.classList.add(&quot;shown&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n    const closeModal = () =&gt; {\r\n        if(modal.classList.contains(&quot;shown&quot;)) {\r\n            modal.classList.remove(&quot;shown&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBy the way, `add` and `remove` will already do a `contains` internally (more or less), so you don&#39;t need to check for that:\r\n\r\n    const openModal = () =&gt; {\r\n        modal.classList.add(&quot;shown&quot;);\r\n    };\r\n    const closeModal = () =&gt; {\r\n        modal.classList.remove(&quot;shown&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNOTE: It is better to use classes for you styling instead of modifying the inline style because in the future you can change the style to show with animations (for example) without needing to change anything from Javascript.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476406/i-cannot-manipulate-css-display-property-with-js/58476563#58476563","title":"I cannot manipulate CSS display property with JS?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11075555,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05ee0cb6a34ac12999a5b63a509d2a2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"globokirman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11075555/globokirman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58476563,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571644204,"creation_date":1571598807,"question_id":58476406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476406","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to set the display value of a modal to block after clicking to the call button. I couldn&#39;t figure out why the JS sheet couldn&#39;t change it even if I double-checked (What I mean is to check the values by window console and check if it matches to JS sheet that I wrote) if I made a spelling mistake or named an element differently but I&#39;m sure there is no mistake. Once I thought the ````onclick = () =&gt; ```` method might not work well and I used ````addEventListener()```` instead. I&#39;m sure that when I code it in the window console it successfully changes the display to block and I&#39;m sure too that it&#39;s displayed on other elements as a normal modal so it&#39;s not hidden as well.

\r\n\r\nI have two components who has to communicate with each other. And I have a service with an api service.\r\n\r\nThe service looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class ExtendedSearchService {\r\n\r\n \r\n  private particiPantINfos : ParticipantInfoDTO[] = [];\r\n\r\n\r\n private  filterparticipantByRegistration$ = new Subject&lt;ParticipantInfoDTO[]&gt;();\r\n\r\n  \r\n  selectedSearch: string; \r\n  selectedValueStatus: string;\r\n  selectedValueOptie: string;\r\n  selectedQrcode: string;\r\n  selectedValueProgressie: string;\r\n  showDropdownChallenge = false;\r\n  showDropdownVcheqCode = false;\r\n \r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    private participantService: ParticipantService,\r\n  ) {}\r\n\r\n  getParticipantInfoUpdates(){\r\n  return  this.filterparticipantByRegistration$.asObservable();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  filerByRegistration(selectedValue: any, startDate: Date)  {\r\n    console.log(&#39;registration filter2 &#39;);\r\n    this.participantService\r\n      .filterParticipantsByRegistration(1, selectedValue as any, moment(startDate).format(&#39;YYYY MM D&#39;))\r\n      .subscribe(filterByRegistration =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(&#39;Filter by registration items:&#39;, filterByRegistration);\r\n        console.log(&#39;StartDate registration: &#39;, startDate);\r\n   \r\n      });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nAnd the extended search component that triggers the service call looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsearchFor() {\r\n    if (this.selectedSearch === &#39;Registratie&#39;) {\r\n      this.extendedSearchService.filerByRegistration(this.selectedValue, this.startDate);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand Then I have a list component where the results has to been shown: \r\n\r\nso this is the method:\r\n\r\n```\r\napplyExtendedFilter(filteredParticipants: ParticipantInfoDTO[]) {\r\n    this.datasource.data = filteredParticipants;\r\n    this.extendedSearchFilterService.getParticipantInfoUpdates().subscribe(participantInfo =&gt; {\r\n      this.participantInfo = participantInfo;\r\n    });\r\n    console.log(&#39;klicked&#39;, this.datasource.data);\r\n\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the template looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &lt;app-extended-search [@searchOpen]\r\n        (clickCloseSearch)=&quot;handleClickCloseSearch()&quot;\r\n        [searchExtended]=&quot;searchExpanded&quot;\r\n        (filterParticipantByChat)=&quot;applyExtendedFilter($event)&quot;\r\n        (extendedSearchFilter.filterparticipantByRegistration$) = &quot;applyExtendedFilter($event)&quot;       \r\n        class=&quot;extended-search&quot;\r\n        [ngClass]=&quot;{expanded: searchExpanded}&quot;\r\n      &gt;&lt;/app-extended-search&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I see the results in the console:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  console.log(&#39;Filter by registration items:&#39;, filterByRegistration);\r\n```\r\nBut the results are not shown in the view(in the list component)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo what I have to change?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\nSo the problem is how to trigger the method:\r\n\r\n```\r\napplyExtendedFilter\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause this line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsole.log(&#39;klicked&#39;, this.datasource.data);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nhas not been triggered\r\n\r\nThis is the list component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class ListComponent implements OnInit {\r\n  @ViewChild(MatPaginator) paginator: MatPaginator;\r\n  @ViewChild(MatSort) sort: MatSort;\r\n  datasource: MatTableDataSource&lt;ParticipantInfoDTO&gt;;\r\n\r\n  participantInfo: ParticipantInfoDTO[] = [];\r\n\r\n  public readonly displayedColumns = [\r\n    &#39;fullName&#39;,\r\n    &#39;dateOfBirth&#39;,\r\n    &#39;email&#39;,\r\n    &#39;projects&#39;,\r\n    &#39;view&#39;\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  public searchExpanded = false;\r\n\r\n  constructor(\r\n    route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n    private participantServer: ParticipantService,\r\n    private extendedSearchFilterService: ExtendedSearchService\r\n  ) {\r\n    const allParticipants: any[] = route.snapshot.data[&#39;participants&#39;];\r\n    this.datasource = new MatTableDataSource(allParticipants);\r\n   // this.extendedSearchFilterService.filterparticipantByRegistration;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.datasource.paginator = this.paginator;\r\n    this.datasource.sort = this.sort;\r\n    this.datasource.sortingDataAccessor = (data, sortHeaderId) =&gt; {\r\n      switch (sortHeaderId) {\r\n        case &#39;dateOfBirth&#39;:\r\n          return new Date(data[&#39;dateOfBirth&#39;]);\r\n        default:\r\n          return data[sortHeaderId];\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    this.extendedSearchFilterService.getParticipantInfoUpdates().subscribe();\r\n\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  applyFilter(filter: string) {\r\n    this.datasource.filter = filter;\r\n    console.log(this.datasource);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  eventStream$;\r\n\r\n  applyExtendedFilter(filteredParticipants: ParticipantInfoDTO[]) {\r\n    console.log(&#39;klicked&#39;, this.datasource.data);\r\n    this.datasource.data = filteredParticipants;\r\n\r\n    this.eventStream$ = this.extendedSearchFilterService.getParticipantInfoUpdates$;\r\n    /* this.extendedSearchFilterService.getParticipantInfoUpdates().subscribe(participantInfo =&gt; {\r\n      this.participantInfo = participantInfo;\r\n    }); */\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I was using a EventEmitter. But because I have replaced the Api calls to a Service. The EventEmitter has to be replaced by a Observable. But the problem is that the ListComponent doesnt update. \r\n\r\nThe template of the listComponent looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n   &lt;app-extended-search [@searchOpen]\r\n        (clickCloseSearch)=&quot;handleClickCloseSearch()&quot;\r\n        [searchExtended]=&quot;searchExpanded&quot;\r\n       \r\n        (extendedSearchFilter.filterparticipantByRegistration$) = &quot;applyExtendedFilter()&quot;\r\n       \r\n        class=&quot;extended-search&quot;\r\n        [ngClass]=&quot;{expanded: searchExpanded}&quot;\r\n      &gt;&lt;/app-extended-search&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this is the important thing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    (extendedSearchFilter.filterparticipantByRegistration$) = &quot;applyExtendedFilter()&quot;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is wrong. But how to replace that?\r\n\r\nSo the extended component sends the data and the List components receives the data from the extended component.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476385/how-to-do-cross-side-communication-between-components-and-observable","title":"How to do cross side communication between components and observable?"},{"tags":["quantum-computing","q#"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":598,"user_id":4063051,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2f5ef2fe5944cf60e0ccf6ec362963a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"glS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4063051/gls"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571653985,"post_id":58476384,"comment_id":103299932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476384/testing-the-q-code-on-a-real-quantum-computer#comment103299932_58476384"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12247928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TIo8qEwschU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfdcb3r-K93JD_aEmpE8jVw_H5inQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"codingislife","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247928/codingislife"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1208,"user_id":8692657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8204574371dfceeaf4194b4ccd9274e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mariia Mykhailova","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8692657/mariia-mykhailova"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571641205,"creation_date":1571598651,"last_edit_date":1571641205,"question_id":58476384,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476384","body_markdown":"I am using the Microsoft Quantum Development Kit for Python.
