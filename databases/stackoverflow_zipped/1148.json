There&#39;s something called &quot;placement transform&quot; that _might_ be configurable before loading a model, but I think it&#39;s just transforming each fragment individually under the hood. I will double-check with the dev team.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269333/model-instancing-and-transforming/58271875#58271875","title":"Model instancing and transforming"}],"owner":{"reputation":416,"user_id":759699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5870ca0a697503f8241a8dc7046b3b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ohra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/759699/ohra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58271875,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570459262,"creation_date":1570450384,"question_id":58269333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269333","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s say I wanted to load 100 individual models (components of a bigger whole) into the viewer and have 10 instances of each.

The models would be quite small in size.\r\n\r\n2) Should it be done normally with viewer3d.start and viewer3d.load? How does the instancing work, will I run into trouble with such a large number of models?\r\nWill I have 1000 load calls or can the instancing be done in some other way?\r\n\r\n3) How do I transform an entire model? I know how to transform fragments of a model. In case of transforming the whole model do I transform all its fragments or is there a hierarchy so I can just transform a &quot;root

I just wonder that how can run this code with http request?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codepen.io/tunahancardak/pen/mdddYpy?editors=0010","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269266/how-to-create-an-api-from-javascript-code","title":"How to create an api from javascript code?"},{"tags":["azure","azure-batch"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1477,"user_id":4896852,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6927395def656c102099e7cb394a191?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fpark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4896852/fpark"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570454972,"post_id":58269263,"comment_id":102908140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269263/azure-batch-nodes-not-processing-queued-tasks#comment102908140_58269263"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3245,"user_id":2206602,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8405790d815a0d3d943d86132af22a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Niels Filter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2206602/niels-filter"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570736161,"creation_date":1570736161,"answer_id":58329993,"question_id":58269263,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58329993","body_markdown":"I opened up a support ticket with Microsoft.

It&#39;s a common error to format the number in text fields\r\n\r\n    &lt;textField&gt;\r\n\t     &lt;reportElement x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; uuid=&quot;20cfbb7d-73d5-4d21-bdf4-7e54b2ccf753&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;textFieldExpression&gt;&lt;![CDATA[NumberFormat.getInstance().format(1.23d)]]&gt;&lt;/textFieldExpression&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/textField&gt;\r\n\r\nThis converts the `Number` to a `String` and the export to excel will not work properly.\r\n\r\nInstead the **correct solution** is to use **pattern**\r\n\r\n    &lt;textField pattern=&quot;#,##0.###;#,##0.###-&quot;&gt;\r\n\t   &lt;reportElement x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;545&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; uuid=&quot;20cfbb7d-73d5-4d21-bdf4-7e54b2ccf753&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t   &lt;textFieldExpression&gt;&lt;![CDATA[1.23d]]&gt;&lt;/textFieldExpression&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/textField&gt;\r\n\r\nThis way the export can understand it&#39;s a number and know which pattern it should apply when it exports to excel. You can even customize the pattern for excel using the [`net.sf.jasperreports.xls.number.pattern`](http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/config.reference.html#net.sf.jasperreports.xls.number.pattern) property.\r\n\r\nA small example having excel detect the number and using different patterns in excel export.

And the &quot;pause&quot; is still there.\r\n\r\nIs there an event I could use instead of the mousedown, or some directive to make it run to completion after mousedown? And how do I get rid of the pause?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Gif to show the time between the function call and the actual scrolling.\r\n[Screencast][1]\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nHH\r\n\r\nEdit again; We added a timeout to the function, and it worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/CangR.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269230/weird-behaviour-on-jquery-animate","title":"Weird

And the last parameter is always a combiner of the previous parameters. The combiner is a function where the input parameters are evaluted values of the selectors (the previous parameteres), eg:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// subtotalSelector and taxPercentSelector are other previously defined selectors\r\nconst taxSelector = createSelector(\r\n  subtotalSelector,\r\n  taxPercentSelector,\r\n  // subtotal and taxPercent are evaluated values of subtotalSelector and taxPercentSelector\r\n  (subtotal, taxPercent) =&gt; subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)\r\n)\r\n\r\n// this is another correct syntax for the same example\r\nconst taxSelector = createSelector(\r\n  [subtotalSelector, taxPercentSelector],\r\n  (subtotal, taxPercent) =&gt; subtotal * (taxPercent / 100)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entry point of your next selectors is the reducer state and optionally component props, in your example I did not see it.\r\nTry to create first selector with use of the redux state, eg:\r\n```js\r\nconst makeSelectCurrentPosition = (state) =&gt;

Azure Databricks makes a distinction between interactive clusters and automated clusters. You use interactive clusters to analyze data collaboratively using interactive notebooks. You use automated clusters to run fast and robust automated jobs.\r\n\r\nYou can create an interactive cluster using the UI, CLI, or REST API. \r\nYou can manually terminate and restart an interactive cluster. Multiple users can share such clusters to do collaborative interactive analysis.\r\n\r\nThe Azure Databricks job scheduler creates an automated cluster when you run a job on a new automated cluster and terminates the cluster when the job is complete. You cannot restart a job cluster.\r\n\r\nReference: [Azure Databricks - clusters][2] and &quot;[Quickstart: Run a Spark job on Azure Databricks using the Azure portal][3]&quot;.\r\n\r\nHope this

Indeed, if `A` has 730 lines (and 182 columns), and `B` has 470 lines (and 61 columns), and if I need to copy the content of the first 25 columns, it currently takes ~8 minutes to achieve the copy (~1 sec per line.)\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\nHow can I modify my code / algorithm in order to speed up the copy ?\r\n\r\n**My code**\r\n\r\n    &#39;

the idiomatic way to compare string length in Rust, accounting for the case where the strings are of equal length?\r\n\r\nThere is a snippet of code in the [lifetimes part of the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-03-lifetime-syntax.html) but it simply returns the latter string if the given strings are of equal length:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn longest&lt;&#39;a&gt;(x: &amp;&#39;a str, y: &amp;&#39;a str) -&gt; &amp;&#39;a str {\r\n    if x.len() &gt; y.len() {\r\n        x\r\n    } else {\r\n        y\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that `.len()` counts the bytes rather than Unicode characters. The desired answer should include a function which returns the longest string in the case that one of the strings is longer in terms of Unicode characters; or something else in the case that the strings are of equal length.

Also, if you need to add more users later on, you are temporarily making your database accessible to the outside world, which is not ideal.\r\n\r\nOur solution was to use [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/) (a tool we had already been using for database migrations, but any such tool would work) to create the users and grants. \r\n\r\nWe where running in Kubernetes, so I could create a Kubernetes Job via Terraform that triggered Liquibase and executed the user creation, but a similar solution is probably possible for your situation. Terraform supports the [remote-exec](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/remote-exec.html) provisioner to trigger a job on a remote host, which can be used to trigger a job on the bastion-host.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269123/best-practice-how-to-use-terraform-to-create-custom-mysql-rds-user-via-ci/58270434#58270434","title":"Best Practice: How to use Terraform to create custom MySQL (RDS) user via CI?"}],"owner":{"reputation":486,"user_id":7549615,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2eeb4134293d2ad6c1b22410dc61c83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vino","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7549615/vino"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570454405,"creation_date":1570449511,"question_id":58269123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269123","body_markdown":"I have currently created an RDS instance in the private subnets of my VPC.

Do not terraform the user and grants. Rather log in to the RDS instance via the bastion host and manually create the user.\r\n\r\n2. Create the RDS instance in the public subnet (db subnet with the public subnets). Then use the TF to create the user and grants.

&quot;approximation&quot; of how it looks:\r\n\r\n[![This is how it looks][1]][1] \r\n\r\n\r\n### Root Layout\r\nYou mentioned you wanted a CardView, so the root is naturally a MaterialDesign Card View:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;com.google.android.material.card.MaterialCardView xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;\r\n        xmlns:app=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto&quot;\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/card&quot;\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n        android:layout_margin=&quot;16dp&quot;\r\n        android:background=&quot;@android:color/darker_gray&quot;\r\n        android:elevation=&quot;4dp&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n### Constraint Layout\r\nInside the card view, there&#39;s one single viewGroup: a Constraint Layout\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/innerRoot&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n            android:background=&quot;@android:color/white&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis ConstraintLayout is going to contain all the Card&#39;s contents in a flat hierarchy. It matches its parent (the card) in width, but it wraps its height, just like the Card itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Top News Header, Icon, and subtext:\r\nTHere are various ways to achieve this, and depending upon your requirements, you may want to play with vertical chains, constraining the width, etc., to avoid text from overlapping each other, and/or to enable/disable multi-line support, or ellipsis, etc. None of this information can be inferred from your static image. \r\n\r\n```\r\n &lt;ImageView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/topFlameImageView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:contentDescription=&quot;Header title&quot;\r\n                android:padding=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:src=&quot;@drawable/ic_flash_on_black_24dp&quot;\r\n                android:tint=&quot;@android:color/holo_red_light&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/topTitleTextView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;Top News&quot;\r\n                android:textStyle=&quot;bold&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=&quot;@id/topFlameImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/bottomTitleTextView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;Editor on duty: Dan&quot;\r\n                android:textColor=&quot;@android:color/darker_gray&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/topFlameImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=&quot;@id/topFlameImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/topTitleTextView&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice it&#39;s just an ImageView, and two TextViews, one below the other, all constrained together.\r\n\r\n### Big Image\r\nI didn&#39;t put an image, but did add a blue background representing the image. I gave it an arbitrary height of 250dp, but this is not mandatory, you may change this; it gives you an idea.\r\n\r\nThis image is constrained to be below the above header with &quot;Top News&quot;, etc, and it spans the whole width of the card.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        &lt;ImageView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/bigImage&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;250dp&quot;\r\n                android:background=&quot;@android:color/holo_blue_dark&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/topFlameImageView&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Title + Icon\r\nBelow the big image, there&#39;s what appears to be a Title (and its icon). Nothing special, just like the &quot;header&quot; above, an image and a text.\r\n**Here is where there&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t do**: In your image, the text in this, aligns to the left/start, even below the icon; in this example, the TextView is constrained to the end/right of the icon, and so if it&#39;s multi-line, it will not &quot;properly&quot; _justify_ its text to fit below the icon. In other words, in the image above, the word &quot;Update&quot; should be below the red &quot;lightning bolt&quot; icon, but it&#39;s not. (I think it looks better this way anyway... but I haven&#39;t thought how to make it look like what you exactly want). Using `drawableStart` in the TextView, doesn&#39;t give the same effect, so that&#39;s why I used a separate imageVIew for these &quot;icons&quot;, to better control the image&#39;s placement.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &lt;ImageView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/titleImageView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_marginTop=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:contentDescription=&quot;Title&quot;\r\n                android:padding=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:src=&quot;@drawable/ic_flash_on_black_24dp&quot;\r\n                android:tint=&quot;@android:color/holo_red_light&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/bigImage&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/titleTextView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;0dp&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;Real Madrid provide Toni Kroos injury update&quot;\r\n                android:textSize=&quot;18sp&quot;\r\n                android:textStyle=&quot;bold&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=&quot;@id/titleImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;@id/titleImageView&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User Avatar, Name, and Timestamp (?)\r\nThis is similar to the Title, and the Header at the beginning, except you want the _timestamp_ (17 m) to be at the end/right of what appears to be the user name _Onefootball_.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n        &lt;ImageView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/userAvatarImageView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_marginTop=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:contentDescription=&quot;Title&quot;\r\n                android:padding=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:src=&quot;@drawable/ic_account_circle_black_24dp&quot;\r\n                android:tint=&quot;@android:color/holo_green_light&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/titleTextView&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/userNameTextView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;Onefootball&quot;\r\n                android:textColor=&quot;@android:color/black&quot;\r\n                android:textSize=&quot;14sp&quot;\r\n                android:textStyle=&quot;bold&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=&quot;@id/userAvatarImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=&quot;@id/titleImageView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;@id/userAvatarImageView&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;com.google.android.material.textview.MaterialTextView\r\n                android:id=&quot;@+id/timestampTextView&quot;\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:paddingStart=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:paddingEnd=&quot;8dp&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;- 17m&quot;\r\n                android:textColor=&quot;@android:color/darker_gray&quot;\r\n                android:textSize=&quot;14sp&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintBaseline_toBaselineOf=&quot;@id/userNameTextView&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf=&quot;parent&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintHorizontal_bias=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n                app:layout_constraintStart_toEndOf=&quot;@id/userNameTextView&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne image, one Text, another text; nothing fancy.\r\n\r\n### Closing the tags\r\nLast but not least, you have to close the ConstraintLayout **and** the CardView...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;/androidx.constraintlayout.widget.ConstraintLayout&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/com.google.android.material.card.MaterialCardView&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that&#39;s all.\r\n\r\n### Final Comment | Conclusion\r\nAt the beginning of this combo, I told you _StackOverflow_ is not a Free Coding Site; this is still true, and I&#39;ve made this effort because it seems like you are learning Android and I love helping people, but keep in mind that in general, it&#39;s *much much* better if you try firsts and come up with 20 different small questions as you go through it. \r\n\r\nI would have personally tried to solve this in small bits (like I presented it above) and when something didn&#39;t behave as expected, it would have been easier to ask here &quot;Hey look at this small thing, why doesn&#39;t it do X Y Z????&quot; than to try to post the whole thing, and hope someone comes around and fixes it for you so you can copy paste the solution and forget about it. \r\n\r\nI really hope you learn from this and don&#39;t just copy/paste it. \r\n\r\nGood luck with your project. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pzk17.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58269105/how-can-i-implement-ui-the-same-as-on-the-image/58276404#58276404","title":"how can I implement ui the same as on the image"}],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":11554408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/318f33f8bc6df42c1665a463fb927a72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Edgar Shvedskiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11554408/edgar-shvedskiy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19,"user_id":11554408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/318f33f8bc6df42c1665a463fb927a72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Edgar Shvedskiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11554408/edgar-shvedskiy"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":125,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570478532,"creation_date":1570449463,"last_edit_date":1570456008,"question_id":58269105,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58269105","body_markdown":"I am developing news app and I want to implement constrainlayout inside CardView and achieve ui the same as image below\r\n[![cardview image][1]][1]\r\n but I could achieve what I want below my xml file\r\nwhere I have implemented constrainlayout inside cardview\r\n\r\n&gt;
