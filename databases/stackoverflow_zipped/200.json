If I set ```pio.renderers``` to equal &quot;browser&quot; then it outputs the Box plot visualisation to a new browser tab: \r\n```python\r\nfig = px.box(test_df,x=&quot;occupation_status&quot;,y=&quot;age&quot;)\r\nfig.show(renderer=&quot;browser&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if the row count of my dataframe is more than 28M rows then this will only display a blank white screen - no visualisation ever appears in the new tab.\r\n\r\nFrom further investigation, it didn&#39;t seem to matter if I had more columns in my dataframe, if I try to plot a Box plot for a dataframe that has more than 28M rows then I can not plot it.\r\n\r\nI know that there is ```render_mode=&quot;webgl&quot;``` for working with larger data, but I can only seem to set that for Scatter and Line plot types.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is there a way to produce interactive Box plots in Plotly for large dataframes? (Same question also holds true for Violin plots too.)\r\n\r\nIf there is not, then what is the limitation preventing the plot from rendering when the row count is greater than 28 million rows?\r\n\r\nIf this is not possible in Plotly then does anyone know of any alternative tools that I could produce big data Box/Violin plots using Python? For example would this be possible with ggplot2 or will the same limitation also exist in that too?\r\n\r\nMy ultimate aim is to produce nice interactive plots using Plotly and then create Dash dashboards that use these plots.\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\n**23/10/19: Additional Testing:**\r\n\r\nI downgraded Plotly to 3.10.0 and got the same result - no figure is rendered and I am just presented with a white screen. I have now upgraded back up to version 4.2 again.\r\n\r\nAdditionaly, I installed Cufflinks. I followed the process described here to get Cufflinks working with Plotly 4: https://github.com/santosjorge/cufflinks/pull/203\r\n\r\nCufflinks behaviour is almost identical to Plotly Express behaviour - if I let the plot render in the notebook then nothing happens (no crash/error, no output of any kind but cell marks itself as run). If I output it to a html file as per the accepted answer Edit in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35746074/cufflinks-for-plotly-setting-cufflinks-config-options-launches, then it produces a very large (approx 1.5gb) html file that again shows up as a white screen when opened.\r\n\r\nAs this issue seems to be caused by working on a large dataframe, I thought there might be an issue with the Jupyter notebook being unable to handle such a large volume of data. Therefore I tried adjusting the ```iopub.data_rate``` as per https://community.plot.ly/t/tips-for-using-plotly-with-jupyter-notebook-5-0-the-latest-version/4156 but it didn&#39;t make a difference.\r\n\r\nAs I am experiencing very similar behaviour in both Plotly Express and Cufflinks, this suggests to me that the issue must be to do with Plotly itself?\r\n\r\nHas anyone had any success producing Box or Violin plots for larger datasets?

Is there a way to achieve this in a single expression like update?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488183/how-to-dynamically-set-value-for-a-field-in-django","title":"How to dynamically set value for a field in django"},{"tags":["android","dagger-2","android-viewmodel"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":196,"user_id":11877776,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-T_0LiJG5n8k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/GHoMFEU_6hk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Duy Khanh Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11877776/duy-khanh-nguyen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571676834,"creation_date":1571676834,"answer_id":58490880,"question_id":58488180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58490880","body_markdown":"From Android developers documentation, the approach to use Activity scope for sharing ViewModel between fragment is fine.\r\n\r\nYou can refer the document here [Share data between fragments][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488180/how-can-i-create-common-viewmodel-for-two-fragments-with-a-dagger2/58490880#58490880","title":"How can I create common ViewModel for two fragments with a dagger2?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11844588,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A_g9sVycyrk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHRE/CVodDhoIjiQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"robert lurese","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11844588/robert-lurese"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571676834,"creation_date":1571667245,"question_id":58488180,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488180","body_markdown":"I use Single Activity Architecture in my application and I need to create a ViewModel common for two fragments using Dagger2.

If there are no\r\n&gt; tenant verified domains (which is the case when the application is not\r\n&gt; registered in a tenant), the app’s publisher domain will be set to\r\n&gt; null.\r\n\r\nAdding a tenant verified domain gives you more verification options.  Verification ensures non-repudiation which is essential for Microsoft to display an application&#39;s publisher to an end user. \r\n\r\nWithout placing a file on a website for the domain (I don&#39;t have a website), these are the options available to me:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nThe first is the domain I verified through DNS, the second is the onmicrosoft.com default domain.

changes the tabcontrols background when the item is selected and deselected. Now you can use a png in front of it where the part you want to color is transparent. So the tabcontrol will be underneath the image and if its background changes the transparent part of the image will let the background of the tabitem shine through and change color. This also removes the need to have two images for selected and unselected state. To get the appearance you want you also need to change the background of the TabControl to the &quot;unselected-purple&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nUse the following image for example:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: an example using vector this has the adventage that you can set both colors to whatever you like and when you resize the control the corners stay sharp. You can transform any image to XAML/Datapoints for the &lt;Path/&gt; using InkScape\r\n\r\n      &lt;Style TargetType=&quot;{x:Type TabItem}&quot; x:Key=&quot;tmp&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Background&quot;

I tried making a new style for every single tab that inherits from the custom style.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Style x:Name=&quot;tab1Image&quot; TargetType=&quot;TabItem&quot; BasedOn=&quot;{StaticResource {x:Type TabItem}}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;\r\n         &lt;Trigger Property=&quot;IsSelected&quot; Value=&quot;True&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Image.Source&quot;

assigning the triggers to the tab items when I am making them\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;TabItem Width=&quot;50&quot; Height=&quot;45&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;TabItem.Style&gt;\r\n    &lt;Style x:Name=&quot;tab1Image&quot; TargetType=&quot;TabItem&quot; BasedOn=&quot;{StaticResource {x:Type TabItem}}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;Style.Triggers&gt;\r\n         &lt;Trigger Property=&quot;IsSelected&quot; Value=&quot;True&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;Setter Property=&quot;Image.Source&quot; Value=&quot;HomeLitUp.png&quot;/&gt;\r\n         &lt;/Trigger&gt;\r\n        &lt;Trigger Property=&quot;IsSelected&quot; Value=&quot;False&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;Setter  Property=&quot;Image.Source&quot; Value=&quot;HomeLitDown.png&quot;/&gt;\r\n        /Trigger&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Style.Triggers&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Style&gt;\r\n &lt;/TabItem.Style&gt;\r\n  &lt;TabItem.Header&gt;\r\n   &lt;Image Width=&quot;24&quot; Source=&quot;HomeLitUp.png&quot;/&gt;\r\n  &lt;/TabItem.Header&gt;\r\n&lt;/TabItem&gt;\r\n```\r\n3.I tried adding the image in the custom style then try to override the trigger event\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Grid Name=&quot;Panel&quot;&gt;\r\n   &lt;ContentPresenter x:Name=&quot;ContentSite&quot; VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; HorizontalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; ContentSource=&quot;Header&quot; Margin=&quot;10,2&quot;/&gt;\r\n   &lt;Image Name=&quot;Image&quot; Width=&quot;24&quot;&gt;&lt;/Image&gt;\r\n&lt;/Grid&gt;\r\n```\r\nBut it didn&#39;t work and I couldn&#39;t call &quot;Image&quot; from the style that&#39;s basedon it because its out of the scope.\r\n\r\nTo recap:\r\nI am sure there&#39;s a solution I am just not getting it, Its easy to change ALL the tabs headers to the two images, I just dont know how to change every tab based on selected true/false to its own two sets of images.\r\n\r\nAll help will be appreciated as I fried my brain searching and trying for the past 48 hours!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

currently I have a table with sorting enabled on one of the columns, the column being createdAt. I want the table to always be sorted but currently how its working is that the column will toggle between DESC, to none, to ASC. This is causing me some headache since for the end user experience the table should always be sorted in some direction, and for future tables with multiple sorting columns I also want sorting to be required. I can&#39;t find any properties on the table or column to support this type of behavior so for a temporary work around I&#39;m just checking on the back-end if its receiving the sorting params and if it isn&#39;t it just defaults to DESC on id. \r\n\r\nColumns are defined in an array of objects and then used as a property on the ant design table. below is my date created column object\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      title: &#39;Date Created&#39;,\r\n      dataIndex: &#39;createdAt&#39;,\r\n      key: &#39;createdAt&#39;,\r\n      width: &#39;17%&#39;,\r\n      sorter: (a, b) =&gt;\r\n        (new Date(a.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(b.createdAt).getTime()) /\r\n        (1000 * 3600 * 24),\r\n      defaultSortOrder: &#39;descend&#39;,\r\n      ...getColumnSearchProps(&#39;createdAt&#39;),\r\n      render: createdAt =&gt; {\r\n        return (\r\n          &lt;span&gt;\r\n            {new Date(createdAt).getMonth()}/{new Date(createdAt).getDate()}/\r\n            {new Date(createdAt).getFullYear()}\r\n          &lt;/span&gt;\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n\r\nand the ant design table component\r\n\r\n    &lt;Table\r\n        columns={columns}\r\n        rowKey={record =&gt; record.id}\r\n        dataSource={data}\r\n        pagination={pagination}\r\n        loading={loading}\r\n        onChange={handleTableChange}\r\n      /&gt;\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nBelow is a link to a code sandbox from the ant design website showcasing how sorting on tables works. My issue has to do with the ant design framework and not my code. If you sort the columns after the column is already ascending it disables the sort. I want my table to always have sorting on, all I need to do is remove the ability to disable the sort.

@Ben P&#39;s request here&#39;s the solution (a python script) I&#39;ve used previously to run lots of export jobs in parallel.  This is pretty rough code and should be improved by checking the status of each export job after it runs to see whether it succeeded.\r\n\r\nI won&#39;t accept this an an answer because the question is looking for a bigquery-native way of performing this task.\r\n\r\nNote that this script was for exporting a versioned dataset, so there&#39;s a bit of extra logic around that which many users may not need.

It also doesn&#39;t create the `dbo._MigrationHistory` table!\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really know what to do, I googled this error a thousand times but I don&#39;t seem to find the answer.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1601562/cannot-find-the-object-xxx-because-it-does-not-exist-or-you-do-not-have-permis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488141/entity-framework-6-cannot-find-the-object-because-it-does-not-exist-or-you-do-n","title":"Entity Framework 6: Cannot find the object because it does not exist or you do not have permissions"},{"tags":["node.js","puppeteer","istanbul","nyc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":165,"user_id":10949440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de9a211ed03d2f44c1f875874fd04bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shubham Tiwari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949440/shubham-tiwari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571837843,"post_id":58488138,"comment_id":103373256,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488138/how-to-improve-puppeteer-startup-performance#comment103373256_58488138"},{"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":1706846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY89w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"seasick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1706846/seasick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":165,"user_id":10949440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de9a211ed03d2f44c1f875874fd04bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shubham Tiwari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949440/shubham-tiwari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571837982,"post_id":58488138,"comment_id":103373343,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488138/how-to-improve-puppeteer-startup-performance#comment103373343_58488138"},{"owner":{"reputation":165,"user_id":10949440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de9a211ed03d2f44c1f875874fd04bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shubham Tiwari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949440/shubham-tiwari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571838538,"post_id":58488138,"comment_id":103373654,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488138/how-to-improve-puppeteer-startup-performance#comment103373654_58488138"},{"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":1706846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY89w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"seasick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1706846/seasick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":165,"user_id":10949440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de9a211ed03d2f44c1f875874fd04bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shubham Tiwari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949440/shubham-tiwari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571839086,"post_id":58488138,"comment_id":103373989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488138/how-to-improve-puppeteer-startup-performance#comment103373989_58488138"}],"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":1706846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY89w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"seasick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1706846/seasick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":173,"user_id":1706846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oY89w.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"seasick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1706846/seasick"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571839452,"creation_date":1571667147,"last_edit_date":1571839452,"question_id":58488138,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488138","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve written a small crawler with the help of Puppeteer. \r\nNow I&#39;m facing the challenge that my tests are rather slowly (&gt; 3 seconds for each test).

can do math with CloudWatch metrics: \r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/using-metric-math.html\r\n\r\nYou can create a metric math expression with the metrics you have in `metric_data_queries` and get the result on the graph. Metric math also works with GetMetricData API, so you could move the calculation you do into MetricDataQuery and get the number you need directly from CloudWatch.\r\n\r\nLooks like you need a number saying what percentage of datapoints in the last month the metric value equaled to 25.\r\n\r\nYou can calculate it like this (this is the source of the graph, you can use in CloudWatch console on the source tab, make sure the region matches your region and the metric name matches your metric):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;metrics&quot;: [\r\n    [\r\n      &quot;AWS/ElasticBeanstalk&quot;,\r\n      &quot;EnvironmentHealth&quot;,\r\n      &quot;EnvironmentName&quot;,\r\n      &quot;ServiceA&quot;,\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;metric&quot;,\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;m1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;visible&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;stat&quot;: &quot;Maximum&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;25&quot;,\r\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Value for severe&quot;,\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;severe_c&quot;,\r\n        &quot;visible&quot;: false\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;m1*0&quot;,\r\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Constant 0 time series&quot;,\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;zero_ts&quot;,\r\n        &quot;visible&quot;: false\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;1-AVG(CEIL(ABS(m1-severe_c)/MAX(m1)))&quot;,\r\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Percentage of times value equals severe&quot;,\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;severe_pct&quot;,\r\n        &quot;visible&quot;: false\r\n      }\r\n    ],\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        &quot;expression&quot;: &quot;(zero_ts+severe_pct)*100&quot;,\r\n        &quot;label&quot;: &quot;Service Uptime&quot;,\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;e1&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  ],\r\n  &quot;view&quot;: &quot;singleValue&quot;,\r\n  &quot;stacked&quot;: false,\r\n  &quot;region&quot;: &quot;eu-west-1&quot;,\r\n  &quot;period&quot;: 300\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo explain what is going on there (what is the purpose of each element above, by id):\r\n\r\n* **m1** - This is your original metric. Setting stat to `Maximum`.\r\n* **severe_c** -  Constant you want to use for your SEVERE value.\r\n* **zero_ts** - Creating a constant time series with all values equal zero. This is needed because constants can&#39;t be graphed and the final value will be constant. So to graph it, we&#39;ll just add the constant to this time series of zeros.\r\n* **severe_pct** - this is where you actually calculate the percentage of value that are equal SEVERE. \r\n  * `m1-severe_c` - sets the datapoints with value equal SEVERE to 0.\r\n  * `ABS(m1-severe_c)` - makes all values positive, keeps SEVERE datapoints at 0.\r\n  * `ABS(m1-severe_c)/MAX(m1)` - dividing by maximum value ensures that all values are now between 0 and 1.\r\n  * `CEIL(ABS(m1-severe_c)/MAX(m1))` - snaps all values that are different than 0 to 1, keeps SEVERE at 0. \r\n  * `AVG(CEIL(ABS(m1-severe_c)/MAX(m1))` - Because metric is now all 1s and 0s, with 0 meaning SEVERE, taking the average gives you the percentage of non severe datapoints.\r\n  * `1-AVG(CEIL(ABS(m1-severe_c)/MAX(m1)))` - finally you need the percentage of severe values and since values are either severe or not sever, substracting from 1 gives you the needed number.\r\n* **e1** - The last expression gave you a constant between 0 and 1. You need a time series between 0 and 100. This is the expression that gives you that: `(zero_ts+severe_pct)*100`. Not that this is the only result that you&#39;re returning, all other expressions have `&quot;visible&quot;: false`.\r\n  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488129/how-to-show-the-percentage-of-uptime-of-an-aws-service-on-the-dashboard-of-cloud/58498414#58498414","title":"How to show the percentage of uptime of an AWS service on the dashboard of CloudWatch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3656,"user_id":1408347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7mD3y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1408347/brian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3656,"user_id":1408347,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7mD3y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1408347/brian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571817792,"creation_date":1571667121,"last_edit_date":1571808935,"question_id":58488129,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488129","body_markdown":"I want to build a dashboard that displays the percentage of the uptime for each month of an Elastic Beanstalk service in my company.\r\n\r\nSo I used [boto3 get_metric_data](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/cloudwatch.html#CloudWatch.Client.get_metric_data) to retrieve the *Environment Health* CloudWatch metrics data and calculate the percentage of non-severe time of my service. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\nimport boto3\r\n\r\nSEVERE = 25\r\n\r\nclient = boto3.client(&#39;cloudwatch&#39;)\r\n\r\nmetric_data_queries = [\r\n    {\r\n        &#39;Id&#39;: &#39;healthStatus&#39;, \r\n        &#39;MetricStat&#39;: {\r\n            &#39;Metric&#39;: {\r\n                &#39;Namespace&#39;: &#39;AWS/ElasticBeanstalk&#39;,\r\n                &#39;MetricName&#39;: &#39;EnvironmentHealth&#39;,\r\n                &#39;Dimensions&#39;: [\r\n                    {\r\n                        &#39;Name&#39;: &#39;EnvironmentName&#39;, \r\n                        &#39;Value&#39;: &#39;ServiceA&#39;\r\n                    }\r\n                ]\r\n            },\r\n            &#39;Period&#39;: 300,\r\n            &#39;Stat&#39;: &#39;Maximum&#39;\r\n        },\r\n        &#39;Label&#39;: &#39;EnvironmentHealth&#39;,\r\n        &#39;ReturnData&#39;: True\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n\r\nresponse = client.get_metric_data(\r\n    MetricDataQueries=metric_data_queries,\r\n    StartTime=datetime(2019, 9, 1),\r\n    EndTime=datetime(2019, 9, 30),\r\n    ScanBy=&#39;TimestampAscending&#39;\r\n    )\r\n\r\nhealth_data = response[&#39;MetricDataResults&#39;][0][&#39;Values&#39;]\r\ntotal_times = len(health_data)\r\nsevere_times = health_data.count(SEVERE)\r\nprint(f&#39;total_times: {total_times}&#39;)\r\nprint(f&#39;severe_times: {severe_times}&#39;)\r\nprint(f&#39;healthy percent: {1 - (severe_times/total_times)}&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m wondering how to show the percentage on the dashboard on CloudWatch.

From your desired output I took you want it yearly but you can specify any time frame you want. Then just count with `groupby()` and `count()`\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [66]: df2 = df.groupby([pd.to_datetime(df.date).dt.year, &quot;action&quot;, &quot;department&quot;]).count().squeeze().rename(&quot;count&quot;)                                                                                            \r\nOut[66]: \r\ndate  action  department\r\n2017  close   marketing     2\r\n      open    sales         1\r\n2018  close   marketing     1\r\n      open    marketing     1\r\n      other   marketing     1\r\n2019  close   marketing     1\r\n              sales         1\r\n      open    sales         1\r\nName: count, dtype: int64\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `squeeze()` and `rename()` are there because afterwards both the count column and the year would be called `date` and you get a name conflict. You could equivalently use `rename(columns={&#39;date&#39;: &#39;count&#39;})` and not cast to a `Series`.\r\n\r\nThe second step is a `pivot_table`. This creates column names from values. Because there are combinations of `date` and `action` without a corresponding value, you need `pivot_table`. \r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [62]: df2.pivot_table(index=&quot;department&quot;, columns=[&quot;date&quot;, &quot;action&quot;])                                                                                                                                    \r\nOut[62]: \r\n           count                                 \r\ndate        2017       2018             2019     \r\naction     close open close open other close open\r\ndepartment                                       \r\nmarketing    2.0  NaN   1.0  1.0   1.0   1.0  NaN\r\nsales        NaN  1.0   NaN  NaN   NaN   1.0  1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `NaN` is internally representated as floating piont, your counts were also converted to floating point. To fix that, just append `fillna` and convert back to `int`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [65]: df2.reset_index().pivot_table(index=&quot;department&quot;, columns=[&quot;date&quot;, &quot;action&quot;]).fillna(0).astype(int)                                                                                                              \r\nOut[65]: \r\n           count                                 \r\ndate        2017       2018             2019     \r\naction     close open close open other close open\r\ndepartment                                       \r\nmarketing      2    0     1    1     1     1    0\r\nsales          0    1     0    0     0     1    1\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get exactly you output you would need to modify `pd.to_datetime(df.date).dt.year`. You can do this with `strftime` (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.dt.strftime.html). Furthermore the column [&quot;2017&quot;, &quot;other&quot;] was dropped because there was no value. If this creates problems you need to include the values beforehand. After the first step a `reindex` and a `fillna` should do the trick.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Yes it does\r\n```\r\nIn [77]: new_index = pd.MultiIndex.from_product([[2017, 2018, 2019], [&quot;close&quot;, &quot;open&quot;, &quot;other&quot;], [&#39;marketing&#39;, &#39;sales&#39;]], names=[&#39;date&#39;, &#39;action&#39;, &#39;department&#39;])\r\n    ...:\r\n\r\nIn [78]: df3 = df2.reindex(new_index).fillna(0).astype(int).reset_index()\r\nOut[78]: \r\n    date action department  count\r\n0   2017  close  marketing      2\r\n1   2017  close      sales      0\r\n2   2017   open  marketing      0\r\n3   2017   open      sales      1\r\n4   2017  other  marketing      0\r\n5   2017  other      sales      0\r\n6   2018  close  marketing      1\r\n..   ...    ...        ...    ...\r\n11  2018  other      sales      0\r\n12  2019  close  marketing      1\r\n13  2019  close      sales      1\r\n14  2019   open  marketing      0\r\n15  2019   open      sales      1\r\n16  2019  other  marketing      0\r\n17  2019  other      sales      0\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                  \r\n\r\nIn [79]: df3.pivot_table(index=&quot;department&quot;, columns=[&quot;date&quot;, &quot;action&quot;])                                                                                                                                    \r\nOut[79]: \r\n           count                                             \r\ndate        2017             2018             2019           \r\naction     close open other close open other close open other\r\ndepartment                                                   \r\nmarketing      2    0     0     1    1     1     1    0     0\r\nsales          0    1     0     0    0     0     1    1     0\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488124/dynamic-column-data-in-pandas-dataframe-populated-by-dataframe/58488775#58488775","title":"Dynamic Column Data In Pandas Dataframe (Populated By Dataframe)"}],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":9538252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/555f00012b2fb6980a5676bd9c86b96a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ByRequest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9538252/byrequest"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58488775,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571670122,"creation_date":1571667115,"question_id":58488124,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488124","body_markdown":"I am really stuck on how to approach adding columns to Pandas dynamically.  I&#39;ve been trying to search for an answer to work through this, however, I am afraid when searching I may also be using the wrong terminology to summarize what I am attempting to do.\r\n\r\nI have a dataframe returned from a query that looks like the following:\r\n```\r\ndepartment  action  date\r\nmarketing   close   09-01-2017\r\nmarketing   close   07-01-2018\r\nmarketing   close   06-01-2017\r\nmarketing   close   10-21-2019\r\nmarketing   open    08-01-2018\r\nmarketing   other   07-14-2018\r\nsales       open    02-01-2019\r\nsales       open    02-01-2017\r\nsales       close   02-22-2019\r\n```\r\nThe ultimate goal is I need a count of the types of actions grouped within particular date ranges.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy DESIRED output is something along the lines of:\r\n```\r\ndepartment  01/01/2017-12/31/2017  01/01/2018-12/31/2018  01/01/2019-12/31/2019\r\n\t\t    open close other\t   open close other\t      open  close other\r\nmarketing\t0    2     0\t\t   1    1     1\t\t\t  0     1     0\r\nsales\t\t1    0     0\t\t   0    0     0\t\t\t  1     1     0\r\n```\r\n&quot;Department&quot; would be my index, then the contents would be filtered by date ranges specified in a list I provide, followed by the action taken (with counts).  Being newer to this, I am confused as to what approach I should take - for example should I use Python (should I be looping or iterating), or should the heavy lifting be done in PANDAS.  If in PANDAS, I am having difficulty determining what function to use (I&#39;ve been looking at get_dummy() etc.).\r\n\r\nI&#39;d imagine this would be accomplished with either 1. Some type or FOR loop iterating through, 2.  Adding a column to the dataframe based on the list then filtering the data underneath based on the value(s), or 3. using a function I am not aware of in Pandas \r\n\r\nI have explained more of my thought process in this question, but I am not sure if the question is unclear which is why it may be unanswered.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458397/building-a-dataframe-with-dynamic-date-ranges-using-filtered-results-from-anothe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488124/dynamic-column-data-in-pandas-dataframe-populated-by-dataframe","title":"Dynamic Column Data In Pandas Dataframe (Populated By Dataframe)"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-core","razor",".net-core","razor-pages"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":196,"user_id":1843966,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uvie5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"T3.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1843966/t3-0"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571669671,"post_id":58488122,"comment_id":103308182,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488122/problems-binding-a-radio-button-group-in-razor-pages#comment103308182_58488122"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":6042255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sQSBYRfW1Nw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABsI/YYdW8gX8aRM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Angius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6042255/angius"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571668763,"creation_date":1571668763,"answer_id":58488665,"question_id":58488122,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58488665","body_markdown":"Having an `int Rating` instead of full `Rating Rating` in the `InputModel` seems to have solved the issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488122/problems-binding-a-radio-button-group-in-razor-pages/58488665#58488665","title":"Problems binding a radio button group in Razor Pages"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":6042255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-sQSBYRfW1Nw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABsI/YYdW8gX8aRM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Angius","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6042255/angius"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58488665,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571668763,"creation_date":1571667113,"question_id":58488122,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488122","body_markdown":"I have a bit of trouble using a radio button group in my **ASP.NET Core 3.0 Razor** page.

I will give an example of this issue.\r\n\r\n```nodejs    \r\nfunction removeProp(obj, propToDelete,value) {\r\n    for (var property in obj) {\r\n            if (obj.hasOwnProperty(property)) {\r\n                if (typeof obj[property] == &quot;object&quot;) {\r\n                    removeProp(obj[property],propToDelete,value);\r\n                } else {\r\n                if(property === propToDelete &amp;&amp; obj[property] == value){\r\n                    delete obj[property];\r\n                    //delete obj;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar obj = \r\n{\r\n    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bank Branch 1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;requests&quot;:[\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16 03:18:02&quot;,\r\n          &quot;req&quot;:[\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:2\r\n             },\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:5\r\n             }\r\n          ]\r\n       },\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16 03:19:05&quot;,\r\n          &quot;req&quot;:[\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:2,\r\n                &quot;status&quot;:true\r\n             },\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:5\r\n             }\r\n          ]\r\n       },\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16 03:19:20&quot;,\r\n          &quot;req&quot;:[\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;22&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:2,\r\n                &quot;status&quot;:true\r\n             },\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;111&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:5,\r\n                &quot;status&quot;:true\r\n             }\r\n          ]\r\n       }\r\n    ]\r\n }\r\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj));\r\nremoveProp(obj,&quot;status&quot;,true);\r\nconsole.log(JSON.stringify(obj));\r\n    \r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect this one, where I have to remove all objects where the status was true, and the parent &quot;date&quot; too. Look for the &quot;2019-10-16 03:19:05&quot;, I don&#39;t want to remove it because there is an object that there is no  &quot;status true&quot; yet...  And &quot;2019-10-16 03:19:20&quot; was removed because all objects were true.\r\n\r\n```nodejs\r\nvar obj = \r\n{\r\n    &quot;name&quot;:&quot;Bank Branch 1&quot;,\r\n    &quot;requests&quot;:[\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16 03:18:02&quot;,\r\n          &quot;req&quot;:[\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:2\r\n             },\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:5\r\n             }\r\n          ]\r\n       },\r\n       {\r\n          &quot;date&quot;:&quot;2019-10-16 03:19:05&quot;,\r\n          &quot;req&quot;:[\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;300&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:2,\r\n                &quot;status&quot;:true\r\n             },\r\n             {\r\n                &quot;amount&quot;:&quot;500&quot;,\r\n                &quot;coin&quot;:5\r\n             }\r\n          ]\r\n       }\r\n    ]\r\n }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488078/how-to-delete-or-filter-a-specific-object-inside-an-array","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to delete or filter a specific object inside an array"},{"tags":["javascript","java","linked-list","stack","undo-redo"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":73451,"user_id":637853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72baa38005eb8de126b2dd2e6fa1d660?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/637853/thomas"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571667306,"post_id":58488076,"comment_id":103306851,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488076/how-can-i-capture-a-data-from-the-user-while-he-she-is-currently-typing#comment103306851_58488076"},{"owner":{"reputation":517,"user_id":10210841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bue02.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rojo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10210841/rojo"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571667938,"post_id":58488076,"comment_id":103307216,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488076/how-can-i-capture-a-data-from-the-user-while-he-she-is-currently-typing#comment103307216_58488076"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12235,"user_id":1921385,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/M5eFJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Moob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1921385/moob"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571670670,"creation_date":1571670670,"answer_id":58489229,"question_id":58488076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489229","body_markdown":"You can create a simple debounce using a setTimeout so that you only record the state after x milliseconds of no typing.

It can also accept a single type which would be just P. This is what is happening in your case, you are defining type P as object `{any, any}` (typescript should complain about it because you specify duplicate key). This means that you are not providing type for the State at all. which from the [DefinetelyTyped should be any](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/3317a1c2cf540224a0d9630a281b3c7cfe99a3b0/types/react/index.d.ts). \r\n\r\n2. you are explicitly defining `state` on the class, so typescript defers the type for it from the definition. `state.user` is an array so there is no `avatar_url` on this element;\r\n\r\nTo fix this you can try explicitly stating that `state` is any when defining\r\n```\r\n    state: any = {\r\n        user: []\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBetter solution would be to actually define a type or interface for the state and not use any. `any` should be avoided, especially in the code which you write for your application.\r\n\r\nYou can define user like type or interface: \r\n```\r\ntype User = {\r\n    name: string,\r\n    avatar?: string\r\n}\r\n// or \r\ninterface IUser {\r\n    name: string,\r\n    avatar?: string\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488041/react-typscript-typehint-any-doesnt-work/58488648#58488648","title":"React/Typscript: typehint any doesn&#39;t work"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12251952,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b9d965f118a2e431a64bb9855252adb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tegradite","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12251952/tegradite"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14847,"user_id":1915893,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/580b31b0be7173bbc477ca1d6967d87c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aluan Haddad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1915893/aluan-haddad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58488333,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571737928,"creation_date":1571666875,"last_edit_date":1571667986,"question_id":58488041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488041","body_markdown":"I have a very simple react component named: `github.tsx`\r\n\r\nIn it, I have this code: \r\n\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;\r\n    import axios from &#39;axios&#39;\r\n    \r\n    class Github extends React.Component&lt;{any, any}&gt;{\r\n    \r\n      state = {\r\n        user: []\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      getRepoUser = async () =&gt;

So if you want to get this kind of processing you have to ensure it yourself using LaTeX for PDF or CSS for HTML.\r\n\r\nIn LaTeX I think it should be possible to do what you want using the `newfloat` and `endfloat` packages in the LaTeX template that you pass to `exams2pdf()`. Any LaTeX template needs to provide `{question}` and `{solution}` environments, e.g., the `plain.tex` template shipped with the package has\r\n\r\n    \\newenvironment{question}{\\item \\textbf{Problem}\\newline}{}\r\n    \\newenvironment{solution}{\\textbf{Solution}\\newline}{}\r\n\r\nwith the exercises embedded as\r\n\r\n    \\begin{enumerate}\r\n    %% \\exinput{exercises}\r\n    \\end{enumerate}\r\n\r\nNow instead of the `\\newenvironment{solution}...` you could use\r\n\r\n    \\usepackage{newfloat,endfloat}\r\n    \\DeclareFloatingEnvironment{hint}\r\n    \\DeclareDelayedFloat{hint}{Hint}\r\n    \\DeclareFloatingEnvironment{solution}\r\n    \\DeclareDelayedFloat{solution}{Solution}\r\n\r\nThis defines two new floating environments `{hint}` and `{solution}` which are then declared delayed floats. And then you would need to customize these environments regarding the text displayed within the questions at the beginning and the listing at the end.

&#39;column_6&#39;, &#39;column_7&#39;, &#39;column_8&#39;, &#39;column_9&#39;]\r\n\r\nfor each of these columns, there are 153 lines of data, containing only two values: -1 or +1\r\n\r\nMy problem is that, for each column, I would like to save the frequencies of each -1 and +1 values in comma-separated style line by line in a CSV file. I have the following problems when I do the following:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;df = pd.read_csv(&#39;data.csv&#39;, skipinitialspace=True, usecols=fields)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;print df[&#39;column_2&#39;].value_counts()\r\n         1    148\r\n        -1      5\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;df[&#39;column_2&#39;].value_counts().to_csv(&#39;result.txt&#39;, index=False )\r\n\r\nThen, when I open results.txt, here is what I found\r\n\r\n&gt; 148 \r\n\r\n&gt; 5\r\n\r\nWhich is obviously what I dont want, I want the values in the same line of the text file separated by comma (e.g., 148, 5).\r\n\r\nThe second problem I have happens when one of the frequencies are zero, \r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; print df[&#39;column_9&#39;].value_counts()\r\n          1    153\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df[&#39;column_9&#39;].value_counts().to_csv(&#39;result.txt&#39;, index=False )\r\n\r\nThen, when I open results.txt, here is what I found\r\n\r\n&gt; 153 \r\n\r\nI also dont want that behavior, I would like to see 153, 0\r\n\r\nSo, in summary, I would like to know how to do that with Pandas\r\n\r\n 1. Given one column, save its different values frequencies in the same line of a csv file and separated by commas. For example: \r\n\r\n&gt; 148,5\r\n\r\n 2. If there is a value with frequency 0, put that in the CSV. For example: \r\n\r\n&gt; 153,0\r\n\r\n 3. Append these frequency values in different lines of the same CSV file. For example: \r\n\r\n&gt; 148,5\r\n\r\n&gt; 153,0\r\n\r\nCan I do that with pandas? or should I move to other python lib? \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488016/pandas-how-to-save-frequencies-of-different-values-in-different-columns-line-by","title":"Pandas- How to save frequencies of different values in different columns line by line in a csv file (including 0 frequencies)"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":692766,"user_id":19068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d2d3229ed1961d2bd81853242493247?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Quentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/19068/quentin"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571666967,"post_id":58488014,"comment_id":103306657,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488014/how-i-can-remove-this-white-spaces-html-css#comment103306657_58488014"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12251905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nBTtb_uS73Q/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfpRJnsB7mLDVr08zG7HxCdoo3-Dg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dino Grrr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12251905/dino-grrr"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":692766,"user_id":19068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d2d3229ed1961d2bd81853242493247?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Quentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/19068/quentin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571667431,"post_id":58488014,"comment_id":103306927,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488014/how-i-can-remove-this-white-spaces-html-css#comment103306927_58488014"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":3029698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rRUA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"estavillo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3029698/estavillo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571666928,"creation_date":1571666928,"answer_id":58488058,"question_id":58488014,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58488058","body_markdown":"Every element has certain rules applied by default by browsers.

At any given point of time, we have 1 team work on multiple projects to work full capacity and due to wait times for the in flight projects. This has caused a complex release plan for multiple projects. But we do manage with it. I do not have the liberty to work on 1 project at a time. I have tried both scrum and kanban. While things have become better due to VSTS visual boards and time boxed delivery, I have not seen a huge improvement in our velocity as compared to the traditional waterfall methodology used previously.

What follows is a rough outline; you need to supply the implementation for each step.\r\n\r\nFirst, you tokenize it, turning `1+12x8` into `[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;+&#39;, &#39;12&#39;, &#39;x&#39;, &#39;8&#39;]`. For this step you need to write a tokenizer or a lexical analyzer. This is the step where you define your operators and literals.\r\n\r\nNext, you convert the token stream into a parse tree. Perhaps you represent the tree as an [S-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression) `[&#39;+&#39;, &#39;1&#39;, [&#39;x&#39;, &#39;12&#39;, &#39;8&#39;]]` or `[operator.add, 1, [operator.mul, 12, 8]]`. This step requires writing a parser, which requires you to define things like the precedence of your operators.\r\n\r\nFinally, you write an evaluator that can reduce your parse tree to a single value. Doing this in two steps might yield\r\n\r\n  1. `[operator.add, 1, [operator.mul, 12, 8]]` to `[operator.add, 1, 96]`\r\n  2. `[operator.add, 1, 96]` to `97`\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488006/how-to-do-math-operations-with-string/58488175#58488175","title":"How to do math operations with string?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3645,"user_id":6858244,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-wfU-doP3Fhc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACbY/GNmdrBKqDSM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Prayson W.

It&#39;s just a matter of finding a way for passing the user input from an html page to the script to then feed back and generate another html page with the information gathered.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58487999/passing-input-in-html-to-be-run-in-python","title":"Passing input in html to be run in python"},{"tags":["c#",".net","nuget-package"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1898,"user_id":56688,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee1220e0ff47d2ad071d6c377ada7965?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pritaeas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/56688/pritaeas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571666845,"post_id":58487997,"comment_id":103306598,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58487997/how-to-publish-net-code-as-nuget-package#comment103306598_58487997"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571667955,"post_id":58487997,"comment_id":103307228,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58487997/how-to-publish-net-code-as-nuget-package#comment103307228_58487997"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12251822,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/565b97c3e4aa7fbcd2721a962d8fe458?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12251822","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12251822/user12251822"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571666738,"creation_date":1571666738,"question_id":58487997,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58487997","body_markdown":"I have created a class library project using VS 2019.

However, the implementation differs which might produce different results in edge cases, and scikit learn has in general more support for larger models. For example, statsmodels currently uses sparse matrices in very few parts.\r\n\r\nThe most important difference is in the surrounding infrastructure and the use cases that are directly supported.\r\n\r\nStatsmodels follows largely the traditional model where we want to know how well a given model fits the data, and what variables **&quot;explain&quot;** or affect the outcome, or what the size of the effect is. Scikit-learn follows the machine learning tradition where the main supported task is chosing the **&quot;best&quot;** model for prediction.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the emphasis in the supporting features of statsmodels is in analysing the training data which includes hypothesis tests and goodness-of-fit measures, while the emphasis in the supporting infrastructure in scikit-learn is on model selection for out-of-sample prediction and therefore cross-validation on &quot;test data&quot;.\r\n\r\nSide note: Your question is more suited on https://stats.stackexchange.com","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58487994/why-am-i-getting-low-score-for-linear-regression-via-sklearn-but-high-r-squared/58489758#58489758","title":"Why am I getting low score for Linear Regression via sklearn but high R-squared value from statsmodels?"}],"owner":{"reputation":363,"user_id":8940641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a0e294bdb31699bd8084dfb4bf97bcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kiran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940641/kiran"},"last_editor":{"reputation":363,"user_id":8940641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a0e294bdb31699bd8084dfb4bf97bcb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kiran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940641/kiran"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58489758,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571672630,"creation_date":1571666735,"last_edit_date":1571667863,"question_id":58487994,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58487994","body_markdown":"I am solving Linear Regression Problem.

So you can still use TLSv1.2 as protocol. Basically they threw away the RSA ciphers.\r\n\r\nTo fix your probem:\r\n\r\nUse:\r\n\r\n    curl_setopt($this-&gt;curlHandle, CURLOPT_SSLVERSION, CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2);\r\n    // CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_2 means minimum TLS v1.2 but also 1.3 is allowed\r\n    // CURL_SSLVERSION_TLSv1_3 would mean minimum TLS v1.3\r\n\r\n\r\nI also suggest to remove:\r\n\r\n    curl_setopt($this-&gt;curlHandle, CURLOPT_TLS13_CIPHERS, &#39;TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_CCM_8_SHA256:TLS_AES_128_CCM_SHA256&#39;);\r\n    // !!! here you force the Ciphers they forbid, so nothing is left to connect !!!\r\n    curl_setopt($this-&gt;curlHandle, CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST, &#39;TLSv1&#39;);\r\n    // let openssl decide\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t set a list of allowed ciphers at all, I would say.\r\n\r\nWhy: because if you have a trustworthy OpenSSL Vendor for your OpenSSL 1.1.1d the defaults should be useful.
