expecting:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\nBut I also tried using it in single query where I needed the inner case,I am being confused in using nested case.But I tried using nested case but its not working.So,If i can do it from nested case statement then,My query can be optimized.So,I tried as:\r\n\r\n    SELECT emp_id, \r\n           emp_name, \r\n           dob, \r\n

              ELSE NULL \r\n           END \r\n    FROM   offc.employee \r\n    WHERE  leave_date IS NOT NULL;\r\n\r\n\r\nI got the error: `ORA-00905: missing keyword`\r\n\r\nSince ,I need the same

to build out a reactive/dynamic form using Angular8, strugglign with rendering a group of checkboxes. I&#39;ve followed the tutorial at https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form, and have it up and running nicely.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using a service to map an array of objects to form controls, and can identify the checkbox list objects, just not sure what to do with them.\r\n\r\nExample from mapping service:\r\n```javascript\r\n    questions.forEach(question =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        if (question.controlType === &#39;checkboxlist&#39;) {\r\n        // here...?\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        group[question.key] = question.required ? new FormControl(question.value || &#39;&#39;, Validators.required)\r\n        : new FormControl(question.value || &#39;&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return new FormGroup(group);\r\n```\r\n\r\nA question of type &#39;checkboxlist&#39; looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      new CheckboxListQuestion({\r\n        key: &#39;myKey&#39;,\r\n        label: &#39;My label&#39;,\r\n        options: [\r\n          { key: &#39;solid&#39;, value: &#39;Solid&#39;, selected: false },\r\n          { key: &#39;great&#39;, value: &#39;Great&#39;, selected: false },\r\n          { key: &#39;good&#39;, value: &#39;Good&#39;, selected: false },\r\n          { key: &#39;unproven&#39;, value: &#39;Unproven&#39;, selected: true }\r\n        ],\r\n      })\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;d like the value as an array of objects `{ key: objectKey, value: selected? }`\r\n\r\nFeels like I&#39;m missing something obvious - have tried creating FormArray/FormControls, but not working.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470343/checkbox-list-in-angular-reactive-dynamic-form","title":"Checkbox list in Angular reactive/dynamic form"},{"tags":["android","json","firebase-realtime-database","android-recyclerview","recycler-adapter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1325,"user_id":2637449,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KXkC4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Md.

Is the programming style in your legacy application really that bad? First a `DataService` object is created with a no-arguments constructor, just to be overwritten in the next step by calling a method on that instance which again returns a `DataService` object. What kind of programmer creates code like that? Or did you just make up some pseudo code which does not have much in common with your real application? Please explain.\r\n\r\nAs for your test code, it also does not make sense because you instantiate `DataService mockObj` as a local variable in your feature method (test method), which means that in your helper method `mockObj` cannot be accessed. So either you need to pass the object as a parameter to the helper methods or you need to make it a field in your test class.\r\n\r\nLast, but not least, your local mock object is never injected into the class under test because, as I said in the first paragraph, the `DataService` object in `getData()` is also a local variable. Unless your application code is compeletely fake, there is no way to inject the mock because `getData()` does not have any method parameter and the `DataService` object is not a field which could be set via setter method or constructor. Thus, you can create as many mocks as you want, the application will never have any knowledge of them. So your stubbing `findByOffset(long offset)` (why don&#39;t you show the code of that method?) has no effect whatsoever.\r\n\r\nBottom line: Please provide an example reflecting the structure of your real code, both application and test code. The snippets you provide do not make any sense, unfortunately. I am trying to help, but like this I cannot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn my comments I mentioned refactoring your legacy code for testability by adding a constructor, setter method or an overloaded `getData` method with an additional parameter. Here is an example of what I mean:\r\n\r\n**Dummy helper class:**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package de.scrum_master.stackoverflow.q58470315;\r\n    \r\n    public class DataService {\r\n      private long offset;\r\n    \r\n      public DataService(long offset) {\r\n        this.offset = offset;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public DataService() {}\r\n    \r\n      public DataService findByOffset(long offset) {\r\n        return new DataService(offset);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public long getOffset() {\r\n        return offset;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @Override\r\n      public String toString() {\r\n        return &quot;DataService{&quot; +\r\n          &quot;offset=&quot; + offset +\r\n          &#39;}&#39;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Subject under test:**\r\n\r\nLet me add a private `DataService` member with a setter in porder to make the object injectable. I am also adding a check if the `ds` member has been injected or not. If not, the code will behave like before in production and create a new object by itself.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package de.scrum_master.stackoverflow.q58470315;\r\n    \r\n    public class ToBeTestedWithInteractions {\r\n      private DataService ds;\r\n    \r\n      public void setDataService(DataService ds) {\r\n        this.ds = ds;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      // legacy code; can&#39;t alter\r\n      public void getData() {\r\n        if (ds == null)\r\n          ds = new DataService();\r\n        ds = ds.findByOffset(5);\r\n        Long len = ds.getOffset();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Spock test:**\r\n\r\nNow let us test both the normal and the error scenario. Actually I think you should break it down into two smaller feature methods, but as you seem to wish to test everything (IMO too much) in one method, you can also do that via two distinct pairs of `when-then` blocks. You do not need to explicitly declare any interaction blocks in order to do so.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-groovy --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package de.scrum_master.stackoverflow.q58470315\r\n    \r\n    import spock.lang.Specification\r\n    \r\n    class RepeatedInteractionsTest extends Specification {\r\n      def &quot;test scene1&quot;() {\r\n        given: &quot;subject under test with injected mock&quot;\r\n        ToBeTestedWithInteractions subjectUnderTest = new ToBeTestedWithInteractions()\r\n        DataService dataService = Mock()\r\n        subjectUnderTest.dataService = dataService\r\n    \r\n        when: &quot;getting data&quot;\r\n        subjectUnderTest.getData()\r\n    \r\n        then: &quot;no error, normal return values&quot;\r\n        noExceptionThrown()\r\n        1 * dataService.findByOffset(5) &gt;&gt; dataService\r\n        1 * dataService.getOffset() &gt;&gt; 200\r\n    \r\n        when: &quot;getting data&quot;\r\n        subjectUnderTest.getData()\r\n    \r\n        then: &quot;NPE, only first method called&quot;\r\n        thrown NullPointerException\r\n        1 * dataService.findByOffset(5) &gt;&gt; null\r\n        0 * dataService.getOffset()\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPlease also note that testing for exceptions thrown or not thrown adds value to thew test, the interaction testing just checks internal legacy code behaviour, which has little to no value.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470315/spock-how-to-work-with-repeated-interactions/58482379#58482379","title":"Spock - How to work with repeated interactions"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":970729,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a843b0eddab3fbe1563a200760f358f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rohit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/970729/rohit"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":970729,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a843b0eddab3fbe1563a200760f358f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rohit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/970729/rohit"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571815116,"creation_date":1571549568,"last_edit_date":1571762785,"question_id":58470315,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58470315","body_markdown":"For few test cases I&#39;m trying to follow a DRY principle, where only the interactions are different with same test case conditions.

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s design limitation. I believe more can be done in the closure than just mentioning the method name.

For example, Python3.8 is not currently available as a Ubuntu package and the version from `ppa:deadsnakes/ppa` appears to be a debug version (see Python issue 38477).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

advice you to user a WebView instead of video view.\r\n\r\nthat will work better.\r\n\r\nBut for your answer\r\n\r\n1.check your connection\r\n\r\n2.check your permissions\r\n\r\n3.check Url that you build with Debug\r\n\r\n4.put start method in try catch\r\n\r\nNow its seems issue in this line:\r\n\r\n    videoView.setVideoURI(Uri.parse(url));\r\nuri means a file path in your device not a url, check it and try again.\r\n\r\nu can update me in comments\r\n\r\nEdited:\r\nuse this method:\r\n\r\n    public Uri getRawUri(String filename) {\r\n        return Uri.parse(ContentResolver.SCHEME_ANDROID_RESOURCE + \r\n    File.pathSeparator + File.separator + getPackageName() + &quot;/raw/&quot; + \r\n    filename);\r\n    }\r\n \r\nnext solution: use `Uri.fromFile` instead of `Uri.parse` \r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\nUse this 2 methods:\r\n\r\n    video.setVideoURI(URI);\r\n    video.setMediaController(new MediaController(this));\r\n    video.requestFocus();\r\n    video.start();\r\n\r\n\r\nTry this in your `onCreate()` method:\r\n\r\n    Uri URI = getRawUri(instructions);\r\n    MediaController mediaController = new

I modeled it with a small number of data elements to streamline the development. Today I attempted to add additional elements and was astounded to find that I could only add 10 views to a view. So I tried the simplest of designs (below). If I added 11 &quot;things&quot; to the view it immediately presented the error on the top item, whatever it was:\r\n\r\n&quot;Argument passed to call that takes no arguments&quot;\r\n\r\nDoesn&#39;t matter whether I call the outside container a ScrollView, VStack, List or Form. Same behavior. Doesn&#39;t matter whether the Text/TextField sub units are in a VStack or not.\r\n\r\nSo I went back to basics - just added ten Text views. No problem. Add an eleventh and it blows up. Here&#39;s one of the variants - but all I need to do was add 10 simple Text views to get it to break.\r\n\r\nI must be missing something really basic here.

First lets associate all the relevant `&lt;View /&gt;` styling props to state values\r\n```JavaScript\r\n// ... all your imports and other code\r\n\r\nstate ={\r\n    viewHeight: 0, // or any default value you want\r\n    viewWidth: 0, // or any default value you want\r\n\r\n    // ... other view parameters used and other state values\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ... functions and other code\r\n\r\nrender() {\r\n    return (\r\n        // ... other rendered components etc\r\n\r\n        &lt;View\r\n            style={{\r\n                width: this.state.viewWidth,\r\n                height: this.state.viewHeight\r\n            }} /&gt;\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n 1. Next we will get the map zoom level every time it changes and preform some sort of conditions\r\n```JavaScript\r\n&lt;MapView\r\n    ref=&#39;map&#39;                                       // &lt;==== add the ref map so we can access the zoom level from our _onMapChange function later\r\n    style={{ flex: 1 }}\r\n    provider={PROVIDER_GOOGLE}                      // &lt;==== this approach will not work on apple maps as the camera will not give us the zoom parameter so use google maps\r\n    onRegionChange={() =&gt; this._onMapChange()} /&gt;   // &lt;==== this will tell the map to fire the _onMapChange() function everytime there is a change to the map region\r\n```\r\n \r\n 3. The `_onMapChange()` function:\r\n```JavaScript\r\n_onMapChange = async () =&gt; {\r\n    const {\r\n        zoom,\r\n        pitch,\r\n        center,\r\n        heading \r\n    } = await this.refs.map.getCamera();\r\n\r\n    // Now set the conditions for the view style based on the zoom level, maybe something like this:\r\n\r\n    if (zoom &lt;= 5) {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            viewWidth: 50,  // what ever width you want to set\r\n            viewHeight: 50  // what ever height you want to set\r\n            // ... other view parameters\r\n        })\r\n    } else if (zoom &lt;= 10) {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            viewWidth: 100,  // what ever width you want to set\r\n            viewHeight: 100  // what ever height you want to set\r\n            // ... other view parameters\r\n        })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n**Heads-Up: I am using my editor that&#39;s all so there might be some syntax errors**\r\n\r\nHope this Helps!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470250/how-to-resize-shapes-drawn-on-map-based-on-zoom-value-with-react-native-maps/58472150#58472150","title":"How to resize shapes drawn on map based on zoom value with react-native-maps"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":8202576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7be7bcb4c6aa4ceff5cbb2db33f014f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"huzaifamansoor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8202576/huzaifamansoor"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571590873,"creation_date":1571590873,"answer_id":58475285,"question_id":58470250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58475285","body_markdown":"You can use Overlay (circle, polygon) or can make your custom overlay to cover certain areas on the map.\r\n\r\nLike this,\r\n\r\n[![Image1][1]][1]\r\n[![Image2][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Link for overlay docs: [react-native-community/react-native-maps][3]**\r\n\r\nTo make it dynamic, precisely calculate longitudeDelta and LatitudeDelta.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/af3W4.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/qQhan.jpg\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-maps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470250/how-to-resize-shapes-drawn-on-map-based-on-zoom-value-with-react-native-maps/58475285#58475285","title":"How to resize shapes drawn on map based on zoom value with react-native-maps"}],"owner":{"reputation":481,"user_id":7024156,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1798302423760750/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ahsan Sohail","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7024156/ahsan-sohail"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571590873,"creation_date":1571548573,"question_id":58470250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58470250","body_markdown":"I am using `react-native-maps` to integrate maps in my application.

you&#39;ll need to calculate the heading and pitch between the two points. [Full post][2] is here and [this answer][1] explains how to do it between any arbitrary two points.\r\n\r\nOnce you have your two angles, if you attempt to use the Euler angles on an SCNBox, you&#39;ll  notice that when you only modify the pitch (`eulerAngles.x`), or only modify the heading (`eulerAngles.y`), everything works fine. However, the moment you try to modify both, you&#39;ll [run into issues][3]. One solution is to [wrap one node inside another][4].\r\n\r\nThis seemed like such a useful suggestion, that I create a handy wrapper node that should handle rotations upon all 3 axes:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport Foundation\r\nimport SceneKit\r\n\r\nstruct HeadingPitchBank {\r\n    let heading: Float\r\n    let pitch: Float\r\n    let bank: Float\r\n\r\n    /// returns the heading and pitch (bank is 0) represented by the vector\r\n    static func from(vector: simd_float3) -&gt; HeadingPitchBank {\r\n        let heading = atan2f(vector.x, vector.z)\r\n        let pitch = atan2f(sqrt(vector.x*vector.x + vector.z*vector.z), vector.y) - Float.pi / 2.0\r\n\r\n        return HeadingPitchBank(heading: heading, pitch: pitch, bank: 0)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass HeadingPitchBankWrapper: SCNNode {\r\n\r\n    init(wrappedNode: SCNNode) {\r\n        headingNode = SCNNode()\r\n        pitchNode = SCNNode()\r\n        bankNode = SCNNode()\r\n        _wrappedNode = wrappedNode\r\n\r\n        super.init()\r\n\r\n        addChildNode(headingNode)\r\n        headingNode.addChildNode(pitchNode)\r\n        pitchNode.addChildNode(bankNode)\r\n        bankNode.addChildNode(wrappedNode)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\r\n        fatalError(&quot;init(coder:) has not been implemented&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var heading: Float {\r\n        get {\r\n            return headingNode.eulerAngles.y\r\n        }\r\n        set {\r\n            headingNode.eulerAngles.y = newValue\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var pitch: Float {\r\n        get {\r\n            return pitchNode.eulerAngles.x\r\n        }\r\n        set {\r\n            pitchNode.eulerAngles.x = newValue\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var bank: Float {\r\n        get {\r\n            return bankNode.eulerAngles.z\r\n        }\r\n        set {\r\n            bankNode.eulerAngles.z = newValue\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var headingPitchBank: HeadingPitchBank {\r\n        get {\r\n            return HeadingPitchBank(heading: heading, pitch: pitch, bank: bank)\r\n        }\r\n        set {\r\n            heading = newValue.heading\r\n            pitch = newValue.pitch\r\n            bank = newValue.bank\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var wrappedNode: SCNNode {\r\n        return _wrappedNode\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private var headingNode: SCNNode\r\n    private var pitchNode: SCNNode\r\n    private var bankNode: SCNNode\r\n    private var _wrappedNode: SCNNode\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could then use this to easily draw a line between two points:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc createLine(start: simd_float3 = simd_float3(), end: simd_float3, color: UIColor, opacity: CGFloat?

So I create the following list of indices that should be changed.\r\n\r\n    l = [np.random.choice(1000) for x in range(100)] (I am not sure if each index is repeated once)\r\n\r\nI want something like\r\n\r\n    np.put(labels_test, l, if labels_test[l] ==1, then 6 and  if labels_test[l] ==6, then 1`\r\nWe can do it for the following toy example:\r\n\r\n    np.random.seed(1)\r\n    labels_test = [np.random.choice([1,6]) for x in range(20)]\r\n    [6, 6, 1, 1, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470227/pythonic-way-to-replace-specific-values-with-other-values-of-numpy-array-within","title":"Pythonic way to replace specific values with other values of numpy array within particular indices"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":616,"user_id":4484288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QOqX9fXhKOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD2I/9CTmwKMn66s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Swaroop Deval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4484288/swaroop-deval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571574123,"post_id":58470225,"comment_id":103279050,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470225/preloader-screen-with-outlined-structure-of-elements#comment103279050_58470225"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12224300,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf7b55c5d3bf1b50dbd6cd372cf8f94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flybywire","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224300/flybywire"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":616,"user_id":4484288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QOqX9fXhKOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD2I/9CTmwKMn66s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Swaroop Deval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4484288/swaroop-deval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571629576,"post_id":58470225,"comment_id":103291151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470225/preloader-screen-with-outlined-structure-of-elements#comment103291151_58470225"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12224300,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aaf7b55c5d3bf1b50dbd6cd372cf8f94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flybywire","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224300/flybywire"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":616,"user_id":4484288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QOqX9fXhKOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD2I/9CTmwKMn66s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Swaroop Deval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4484288/swaroop-deval"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571632299,"post_id":58470225,"comment_id":103291606,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470225/preloader-screen-with-outlined-structure-of-elements#comment103291606_58470225"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":616,"user_id":4484288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-QOqX9fXhKOg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD2I/9CTmwKMn66s/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Swaroop Deval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4484288/swaroop-deval"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571550046,"creation_date":1571550046,"answer_id":58470347,"question_id":58470225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58470347","body_markdown":"This is called shimmer.

Adjacent pixels in columns are *not* adjacent in\r\nmemory, and this makes multi-threading with rayon or crossbeam\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that each *source* is read-only.  Generating the energy\r\nmap requires write access only to the energy map.  For columns, if I\r\ncould rotate the energy map I could multi-thread horizontal scanning.\r\nThat turns out to be easy, and all I need is a proxy object to map the\r\n`(x, y)` to `(y, x)` when reading the image.  Let&#39;s call that proxy\r\nobject a `Pivot`.\r\n\r\nLet me show some code (AviShaOne is the first seam carving algorithm, \r\nfrom Avidan &amp; Shamir, &quot;Seam Carving,&quot; 2007):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfn calculate_energy&lt;I, P, S&gt;(image: &amp;I) -&gt; TwoDimensionalMap&lt;u32&gt;\r\nwhere\r\n\tI: GenericImageView&lt;Pixel = P&gt;,\r\n\tP: Pixel&lt;Subpixel = S&gt; + &#39;static,\r\n\tS: Primitive + &#39;static,\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nimpl&lt;&#39;a, I, P, S&gt; AviShaOne&lt;&#39;a, I, P, S&gt;\r\nwhere\r\n\tI: GenericImageView&lt;Pixel = P&gt;,\r\n\tP: Pixel&lt;Subpixel = S&gt; + &#39;static,\r\n\tS: Primitive + &#39;static,\r\n{\r\n\tfn find_vertical_seam(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt; {\r\n\t\tenergy_to_seam(&amp;calculate_energy(self.image))\r\n\t}\r\n\tfn find_horizontal_seam(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt; {\r\n\t\tenergy_to_seam(&amp;calculate_energy(&amp;Pivot::new(self.image)))\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet me emphasize: The above code *works*.  The Pivot remaps the\r\ncoordinates, and now the internal functions can work with thread-capable\r\nmemory objects.\r\n\r\nIf I want to reduce an image by more than one seam, I have to run this\r\ncalculation repeatedly.  It would be nice if I could *cache* the energy\r\nmap.  (Since the seam meanders, and removing that seam would damage\r\nseams that cross it, the column removed would be fairly large, but\r\nit would still be less bad than recalculating it for *every seam*.)  I\r\nwant to add the energy map to the `struct`, and bring `calculate_energy`\r\ninto the the `impl`.\r\n\r\nThis is where things get weird:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimpl&lt;&#39;a, I, P, S&gt;  AviShaOne&lt;&#39;a, I, P, S&gt;\r\nwhere\r\n\tI: GenericImageView&lt;Pixel = P&gt;,\r\n\tP: Pixel&lt;Subpixel = S&gt; + &#39;static,\r\n\tS: Primitive + &#39;static,\r\n{\r\n    fn calculate_energy(&amp;self, image: &amp;I) -&gt; TwoDimensionalMap&lt;u32&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\tfn find_horizontal_seam(&amp;self) -&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt; {\r\n\t\tenergy_to_seam(&amp;self.calculate_energy(&amp;Pivot::new(self.image)))\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll I did was move `calculate_energy` into the implementation.  No other\r\ncode was changed.  `Pivot` has the same type signature as `AviShaOne`,\r\nas they&#39;re both handling these `GenericImageView` objects.

Furthermore, different processes&#39; address spaces are completely isolated from each other.\r\n\r\nWith this, you can&#39;t simply take a pointer printed by a program and then simply use it in a different process.\r\n\r\nRead more here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_management_(computing)\r\n\r\nA separate issue is that neither of your two examples allocates enough storage for `memory`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470182/how-to-alloc-memory-manually/58470208#58470208","title":"How to alloc memory manually"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11843606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-qu1MeDW9Jh0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKWc/RJ1_6zphHIo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Calisto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11843606/calisto"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6008,"user_id":10147399,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kFBe9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ayxan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10147399/ayxan"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571553804,"creation_date":1571547769,"last_edit_date":1571553804,"question_id":58470182,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58470182","body_markdown":"When I was studying pointer, I had an idea to get a better view about the \r\nmemory allocation, so I tried to allocate memory manually to the pointer,\r\nbut it didn&#39;t work.\r\nCan someone explain more about it?

code in both your constructor and destructor are not needed. To understand why you need to have a better understanding of object lifetime.\r\n\r\n    class Example {\r\n        std::queue&lt;ObjectOfClass&gt; Elements;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the above example each instance of your class will have a private member Elements of type std::queue&lt;ObjectOfClass&gt;. This class has a no argument constructor so you&#39;re not forced to initialize in your constructor, the default constructor is called for you. When `Elements` is destroyed the same is true for its members. Since `std::queue` is not a reference type its lifetime is tied to your `Example` instance.\r\n\r\nHowever, lets assume that `std::queue&lt;&gt;` did not provide a no-argument constructor.

The\r\n&gt; Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource\r\n&gt; files into an APK, an Android package, which is an archive file with\r\n&gt; an .apk suffix. One APK file contains all the contents of an Android\r\n&gt; app and is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the\r\n&gt; app.\r\n\r\nSo, Kotlin, Java, and C++ are the officially supported languages. Using any languages other than them will be a hacky process. Basically, android apps run in a virtual machine. If you want to build apps with python then you have to have a way to convert python code into byte code that the VM understands. I am afraid there is official support for this kind of conversion like Kotlin.\r\n\r\nAlthough [this answer][2] shows how you can develop android apps using python but you would probably not consider using python over Java/Kotlin for the following two primary reasons:\r\n\r\n 1. Official support. \r\n 2.

The requirement is to find only records in price table that include all of the menu codes in a list and only those in the list. The data (simplified) looks like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nprice Table\r\nprice_id | site\r\n----------------\r\n1001     | 150\r\n1002     | 151\r\n1003     | 152\r\n1004     | 153\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nmenu Table\r\nmenu_id  | code   \r\n------------------\r\n5001     | 10000\r\n5002     | 10001\r\n5003     | 10002\r\n5004     | 10003\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nprice_menu Table\r\nprice_id | menu_id\r\n------------------\r\n1001     | 5002\r\n1002     | 5002\r\n1002     | 5003\r\n1003     | 5002\r\n1003     | 5003\r\n1003     | 5004\r\n```\r\n\r\nJoining price and menu through price_menu, you would get\r\n```\r\nprice joined with price_menu joined with menu\r\nprice_id | site  |  menu_id  | code\r\n------------------------------------\r\n1001     | 150   |  5002     | 10001\r\n1002     | 151   |  5002     | 10001\r\n1002     | 151   |  5003     | 10002\r\n1003     | 152   |  5002     | 10001\r\n1003     | 153   |  5003     | 10002\r\n1003     | 153   |  5004     | 10003\r\n```\r\nSo, if I wanted to find prices that are associated with menu.code=10001 and menu.code=10002, and only those codes, I should get the record with price_id=1002 only. The record with price_id=1001 has only one of the two menu.codes and the record with price_id=1003 has and addition menu. Therefore, only record(s) for price_id=1002 should be returned.\r\n\r\nI came up with this query. However, the problem is that there could be many menus associated with a price and it would get too large and probably slow as every menu you add to the query you need another subquery.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT * FROM (SELECT *,\r\n  (SELECT code AS mycode FROM price AS pc1 \r\n   INNER JOIN price_menu AS pm1 ON pc1.id=pm1.price_id \r\n   JOIN menu AS m1 ON pm1.menu_id=m1.id\r\n   WHERE pc1.id=pc.id\r\n   AND m1.code = &#39;1571403743330&#39;\r\n) AS data1,\r\n  (SELECT code AS mycode FROM price AS pc2 \r\n   INNER JOIN price_menu AS pm2 ON pc.id=pm2.price_id \r\n   JOIN menu AS m2 ON pm2.menu_id=m2.id\r\n   WHERE pc2.id=pc.id\r\n   AND m2.code = &#39;1571403754395&#39;\r\n) AS data2\r\nFROM price AS pc ) AS outerquery\r\nWHERE data1 = &#39;1571403743330&#39;\r\nAND data2 = &#39;1571403754395&#39;\r\n```\r\nThis will produce one row per price found. However, there is no requirement that it be a single row. Can anyone suggest an alternative that would not require an additional subquery per menu?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58470171/sql-query-to-find-records-if-and-only-if-join-table-contains-all-of-a-list-of-va","title":"SQL query to find records if and only if join table contains all of a list of values"},{"tags":["mysql","node.js"],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12006743,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23db8422bd9a703a13467878e81065f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12006743/lim"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":12006743,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23db8422bd9a703a13467878e81065f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12006743/lim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571555529,"creation_date":1571547616,"last_edit_date":1571548096,"question_id":58470169,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58470169","body_markdown":"i want to make multiple delete or checkall data using mysql and NodeJS but not working. this is my code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;form id=&quot;add-row-form&quot;
