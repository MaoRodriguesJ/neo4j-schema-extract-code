I only included the email part that&#39;s broken from adding bcc.\r\nI need to add several bcc recipients to it. But when I add them, the script keeps on sending, and enters &quot;EMAIL_SENT&quot; in a column and keeps on going down the column through all the blank rows like this. The script stops at the 1st blank row until I add a bcc. How can I add a bcc recipient to this and not send duplicate emails?\r\n\r\nI added the argument for cc / bcc with a list of two emails and this makes it send duplicates.\r\n\r\n\r\n``` ---\r\n/* Sends non-duplicate emails with data from the current spreadsheet.\r\n */\r\nfunction SendEmail() {\r\n  //if ()\r\n  var esheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();\r\n  var EMAIL_SENT = &#39;EMAIL_SENT&#39;;\r\n  var startRow = 2; // First row of data to process\r\n  var numRows = 1000; // Number of rows to process\r\n  // Fetch the range of cells A4:C100\r\n  var dataRange = esheet.getRange(startRow, 1, numRows, 3);\r\n  // Fetch values for each row in the Range.\r\n  var data = dataRange.getValues();\r\n  for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; ++i) {\r\n    var row = data[i];\r\n    var emailAddress = row[0]; // First column\r\n    var message = row[1]; // Second column\r\n    var emailSent = row[2]; // Third column\r\n    if (emailSent != EMAIL_SENT) { // Prevents sending duplicates\r\n      var subject = &#39;You have a new message in the message center.&#39;;\r\n      MailApp.sendEmail(emailAddress, subject, message, {\r\n  htmlBody: message,\r\n  cc: &#39;boss@company.com&#39;,\r\n  bcc: &#39;customers@home.com&#39;\r\n});\r\n      esheet.getRange(startRow + i, 3).setValue(EMAIL_SENT);\r\n      // Make sure the cell is updated right away in case the script is interrupted\r\n      SpreadsheetApp.flush();\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n// [END apps_script_gmail_send_emails_2]\r\n```\r\n        \r\nI expect this to send an email and stop sending when it gets to a blank row.

However you go about it, you will have to visit each element and delete it individually, and then delete the array with `delete [] myArr;`.\r\n\r\nBut dynamically allocating arrays can be messy business. In keeping up with SO traditions, I&#39;m going to recommend `std::vector` (or whatever STL container makes sense) if you are able to use it. You would still have to individually delete all elements, but now you don&#39;t have to worry about the array itself.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the comments to your question, if you use smart pointers to each element, then you don&#39;t have to manually delete anything.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120816#58120816","title":"Deleting corresponding element pointed to by each element of an array of pointer in c++"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2891,"user_id":1455108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaRtd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jo&#227;o Paulo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1455108/jo%c3%a3o-paulo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569514416,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":102630350,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment102630350_58120842"},{"owner":{"reputation":3180,"user_id":4474230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/713c7ce18010e541853962264a719d83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeffrey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4474230/jeffrey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2891,"user_id":1455108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaRtd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jo&#227;o Paulo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1455108/jo%c3%a3o-paulo"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569514497,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":102630384,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment102630384_58120842"},{"owner":{"reputation":2891,"user_id":1455108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaRtd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jo&#227;o Paulo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1455108/jo%c3%a3o-paulo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569514586,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":102630434,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment102630434_58120842"},{"owner":{"reputation":1093,"user_id":5345646,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTuR0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mooncrater","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5345646/mooncrater"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569550203,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":102641482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment102641482_58120842"},{"owner":{"reputation":1093,"user_id":5345646,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hTuR0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mooncrater","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5345646/mooncrater"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292521,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":103193362,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment103193362_58120842"},{"owner":{"reputation":3180,"user_id":4474230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/713c7ce18010e541853962264a719d83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeffrey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4474230/jeffrey"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571311808,"post_id":58120842,"comment_id":103203696,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120718/deleting-corresponding-element-pointed-to-by-each-element-of-an-array-of-pointer/58120842#comment103203696_58120842"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3180,"user_id":4474230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/713c7ce18010e541853962264a719d83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeffrey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4474230/jeffrey"},"comment_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569514257,"creation_date":1569514257,"answer_id":58120842,"question_id":58120718,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58120842","body_markdown":"Delete each object first, then the whole array:\r\n\r\n    for(int i = 0;

hard to answer your question without knowing what your data looks like.

Looking into the source code of the ```clean.boudt``` function I find the following cause of your error:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nT = dim(R)[1]\r\n...\r\nfor (t in c(1:T)) {\r\n    d2t = as.matrix(R[t, ] - mu) %*% invSigma %*% t(as.matrix(R[t, \r\n      ] - mu))\r\n    vd2t = c(vd2t, d2t)\r\n  }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dim(R)[1] extracts the number of rows in the data supplied to the R argument in the function. It appears that your data has no rows, so check the data type of ```pgfzc_elev```\r\n\r\nThe cause of the error is likely from your use of $ to subset ```pgfzc_all```. \r\n\r\n```r\r\npgfzc_elev &lt;- pgfzc_all$ELEV \r\n```\r\n\r\nI reckon it is of class integer, which is why dim(R)[1] does not work in the function.\r\n\r\nRather subset your object like this:\r\n```r\r\npgfzc_elev &lt;- pgfzc_all[, ELEV, drop = F]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTry that and see if it works.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120686/error-when-running-performanceanalytics-function-in-r/58120898#58120898","title":"Error when running PerformanceAnalytics function in R"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":6884508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a9cbecc773f3e6afa2ff4430e0a620a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"casaler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6884508/casaler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8498,"user_id":10323798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/723926e5087b067e92d4d877d604a304?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NelsonGon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10323798/nelsongon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569514911,"creation_date":1569513676,"last_edit_date":1569514300,"question_id":58120686,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120686","body_markdown":"I am getting a Error in 1:T : argument of length 0 when running the Performance Analytics package in R.  am I missing a package?

However if you are looking for solutions without it you can always use Promises.  \r\nSo the problem you are facing is that the code is being executed before the data is received from the server. You can remedy that by promisifying your call to firestore inside the service and returning a Promise, then you can invoke the Promise inside your component.  \r\nSo the code becomes:\r\nThe service Class\r\n```\r\ngetUserInfo() {\r\nlet promise =  new Promise( (resolve,reject) =&gt; {\r\n    this.db.collection(&#39;users&#39;).doc(`${this.cookie.get(&quot;id&quot;)}`).ref.get().then(doc =&gt; {\r\n      resolve(doc.data());\r\n    }).catch(er =&gt; {\r\n      reject(er);\r\n    })\r\n}\r\nreturn promise;\r\n);\r\n```\r\nThen in the component ts file you can do:\r\n```\r\n   ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.authService.getUserInfo().then(data =&gt; {\r\n          this.user = data;\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nHope this helps!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120671/service-class-functions-return-undefined-when-i-use-it-inside-other-components-i/58122632#58122632","title":"Service class functions return undefined when i use it inside other components in Agular"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":187,"user_id":9053397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17c56a97ac05745a844d3e32377f03d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"raghul selvam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9053397/raghul-selvam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569528917,"creation_date":1569528917,"answer_id":58124145,"question_id":58120671,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124145","body_markdown":"I recreated your sceanario in [this][1] stackblitz, this is ***working*** fine\r\n\r\n**util.service.ts**\r\n\r\n    import { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Injectable()\r\n    export class UtilService {\r\n    \r\n      constructor() { }\r\n    \r\n      getUserInfo() {\r\n        return new Promise((res,rej) =&gt;

I have, however, shown a little more in the [JSFIDDLE example][4].\r\n\r\n    &lt;header data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n    &lt;/header&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;main&gt;\r\n        &lt;section data-theme=&quot;light&quot;&gt;\r\n            ...\r\n        &lt;/section&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;section data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;\r\n            ...\r\n        &lt;/section&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;section data-theme=&quot;light&quot;&gt;\r\n            ...\r\n        &lt;/section&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;section data-theme=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;\r\n            ...\r\n        &lt;/section&gt;\r\n    &lt;/main&gt;\r\n\r\nWhen I run my page, I get the following console output without scrolling anywhere and can&#39;t see why:\r\n\r\n    &gt; dark\r\n    &gt; light\r\n    &gt; dark\r\n    &gt; light\r\n    &gt; dark\r\n\r\nTo help you help me, I have put together a [FIDDLE][4] to help get this working.\r\n\r\nCould somebody with knowledge of this new Intersection Observer API please help me cross the threshold? Pardon the pun.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 1**\r\n\r\n[I think I have got it working here][5]. Still tinkering.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2**\r\n\r\nYep, [it&#39;s working][6].\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll add my own answer because I&#39;m sure somebody else will find this useful instead of deleting the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/A0ZV5.png\r\n  [2]: http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API\r\n

recognize it&#39;s changed.\r\n\r\nNow I am loading my data from a Chat store using connect and redux, then passing that data into the &lt;Chat /&gt; component.\r\n\r\nI get the error when I try to

Weirdly I can get one to update but after adding one it will not show others.\r\n\r\nAt first I think this is a problem in my reducer so I rewrite the reducer to use the Object assign and array spread operator.\r\n\r\nNow I think it is related to the rendering which is unexpected.\r\n\r\nHow do I debug this?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not &quot;it works with adding 1 message&quot;.

I don&#39;t need to wait for a response when I send a message like I would with an HTTP response.\r\n\r\nMy websocket controller:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tonMessage = ({data}) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tconst json = JSON.parse(data)\r\n\t\tif (json) {\r\n\t\t\tif (json.status) {\r\n\t\t\t\tconst reducer = this.stateFilters[json.status]\r\n\t\t\t\tif (reducer) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\treducer(json.body)\r\n\t\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tconsole.log(&quot;No reducer&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe websocket controller is created in my View component:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nmy main view\r\n\r\nimport {ChatStateFilters} from &#39;../../reducers/chat&#39;\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatch = { chatMessage }\r\n\r\nthis.wsController = new WebSocketController({\r\n      stateFilters: {chatMessage: this.props.chatMessage},\r\n```\r\n\r\nfrom the chat reducer file (that contains the chatMessage reducer)\r\n\r\nThose state filters get created when I create my slice.\r\n\r\nThe value of stateFilter[&#39;chatMessage&#39;] -- which is the value of what gets bound to my View&#39;s prop in `mapDispatchToProp`\r\n\r\nis this function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet fn = (payload) =&gt; {\r\n      return dispatch =&gt; {\r\n          dispatch(stateFilters[actionName](payload))\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\nexportedStateFilters[actionName] = fn\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the problem is somewhere in here^... somehow the dispatch is firing, updating state but redux doesn&#39;t know the dispatch is finished\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\n\r\nI thought the lack of async may have been an issue. So I changed the stateFilter (the fn that gets bound to my prop in the view) to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   let fn = (payload) =&gt; {\r\n      return dispatch =&gt; {\r\n        post(&quot;&quot;, {}, true)\r\n        .then(response =&gt; {\r\n          dispatch(stateFilters[actionName](payload))\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n          dispatch(stateFilters[actionName](payload))\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand now it works a few more times.. then gives me the error &quot;A state mutation was detected between dispatches&quot;.\r\n\r\nMy chat message reducer is still\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport default (state, action) =&gt; {\r\n\tlet messages2 = Object.assign([], [...state.messages, action.payload])\r\n  return Object.assign({}, {...state, messages: messages2 })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso why is this error happening?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120646/a-state-mutation-was-detected-inside-a-dispatch-not-in-between-dispatch","title":"a state mutation was detected inside a dispatch (NOT &quot;in between&quot; dispatch)"},{"tags":["python","dictionary","random"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36443,"user_id":9698684,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Hj2XY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yatu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9698684/yatu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513726,"post_id":58120643,"comment_id":102630044,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120643/how-do-i-get-random-values-from-nested-dictionaries#comment102630044_58120643"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513730,"post_id":58120643,"comment_id":102630047,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120643/how-do-i-get-random-values-from-nested-dictionaries#comment102630047_58120643"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513774,"post_id":58120643,"comment_id":102630070,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120643/how-do-i-get-random-values-from-nested-dictionaries#comment102630070_58120643"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11973098,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB4yMe6WWg55W0jtBUOEswJ9L9e79Z6YO4KDJ6q6Q=k-s128","display_name":"jiggyJorsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11973098/jiggyjorsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569536097,"post_id":58120730,"comment_id":102639064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120643/how-do-i-get-random-values-from-nested-dictionaries/58120730#comment102639064_58120730"},{"owner":{"reputation":3689,"user_id":1621041,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWGcV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"finefoot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1621041/finefoot"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11973098,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB4yMe6WWg55W0jtBUOEswJ9L9e79Z6YO4KDJ6q6Q=k-s128","display_name":"jiggyJorsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11973098/jiggyjorsh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569540379,"post_id":58120730,"comment_id":102639862,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120643/how-do-i-get-random-values-from-nested-dictionaries/58120730#comment102639862_58120730"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3689,"user_id":1621041,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eWGcV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"finefoot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1621041/finefoot"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569513820,"creation_date":1569513820,"answer_id":58120730,"question_id":58120643,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58120730","body_markdown":"&gt; I can get one random value from the deck variable, using `random.choice(list(deck.keys()))`\r\n\r\nWhy don&#39;t you just repeat that?

To put this into a series of separate column, you could use `spread()` to distribute them under columns with the model name.  I would think in this case you would want separate tables for event duration and rainfall\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120629/how-can-i-summarize-and-count-multiple-column-data-surrounded-by-zeros/58122566#58122566","title":"How can I summarize and count multiple column data surrounded by zeros"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11755142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33339f57241643a771d20e70d1c0879d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SamK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11755142/samk"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58122566,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569524521,"creation_date":1569513461,"question_id":58120629,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120629","body_markdown":"I am working with climate precipitation datasets and need to identify the length (how many consecutive days) of a precipitation event and then summarize these events by summing the total rainfall of an event.

is indeed [srand](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/srand.html) that you want. While it is true that generally one need not muck about with it, there are a few uses \r\n\r\n&gt; However, there are a few situations where programs are likely to want to call `srand`. One is for generating predictable results, generally for testing or debugging. There, you use `srand($seed)`, with the same `$seed` each time. \r\n\r\nand, precisely for your purpose\r\n\r\n&gt; Another case is that you may want to call `srand` after a `fork` to avoid child processes sharing the same seed value as the parent (and consequently each other).\r\n\r\nA quicky example\r\n\r\n    perl -wE&#39;\r\n        say &quot;Parent $$ rand: &quot;, rand;  \r\n        for (1..4) { \r\n            $pid = fork // die &quot;Cant fork: $!&quot;; \r\n            if ($pid == 0) { srand(); say &quot;\\tchild $$ rand: &quot;, rand; exit } \r\n        }&#39;\r\n\r\nPrints\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: none --&gt;\r\n\r\n    Parent 23375 rand: 0.502774688721733\r\n            child 23376 rand: 0.914527430039929\r\n            child 23377 rand: 0.97985713889739\r\n            child 23378 rand: 0.127702740327553\r\n            child 23379 rand: 0.187181734786467\r\n\r\nIt is the `srand` up there that does the trick; without it the numbers are the same (as they must be).  Note that it can be run with a seed as well, which gives us better diagnostic/testing control.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA note, to avoid spreading bad habits.   \r\n\r\nIn a quick program as above the child processes get cleaned up by the system (reaped by init). However, one really should _always_ reap so the above should really have\r\n\r\n    for (1..4) { \r\n        $pid = fork // die &quot;Cant fork: $!&quot;; \r\n        if ($pid == 0) { srand(); say &quot;\\tchild $$ rand: &quot;, rand; exit } \r\n        push @procs, $pid;\r\n    }\r\n    for (@procs) { $gone = wait; say &quot;$gone exited with $?&quot; }\r\n\r\nor use [waitpid](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/waitpid.html), perhaps non-blocking for better monitoring, and perhaps in a [signal handler](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlipc.html#Signals).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120618/how-to-get-random-number-in-forked-processes/58120770#58120770","title":"How to get random number in forked processes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9528148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/094b40ec470688fc4d2f152ffbbd7251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yuval","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9528148/yuval"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41306,"user_id":4653379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3953dbedd0dabff5cbc3db9b0835b14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zdim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4653379/zdim"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58120770,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569906837,"creation_date":1569513416,"last_edit_date":1569906837,"question_id":58120618,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120618","body_markdown":"I&#39;m forking few processes and I need each process to perform a task on a randomly selected items. \r\nI found that the forked processes pick the exact same random numbers. \r\nI tried generating seeds and call srand(), but it didn&#39;t help much.

The after appending `&quot;_update_$(date +%F).tar.xz&quot;` to your `tarname` input you could do:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    \r\n    [ -z &quot;$1&quot; ] || [ -z &quot;$2&quot; ] &amp;&amp; { ## validate 2 arguments given\r\n        printf &quot;error: insufficient input\\nusage: %s file dest\\n&quot; &quot;${0##*/}&quot; &gt;&amp;2\r\n        exit 1\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    dirname=&quot;$1&quot;                              ## name of directory to archive\r\n    tarname=&quot;${2}_update_$(date +%F).tar.xz&quot;  ## archive name\r\n    \r\n    tar -cJf &quot;$tarname&quot; &quot;$dirname&quot;/*          ## create compressed archive\r\n\r\n**Example Directory to Archive**\r\n\r\n    $ ls -al tmpd/\r\n    total 4\r\n    drwxr-xr-x  2 david david 180 Sep 26 11:15 .\r\n    drwxrwxrwt 20 root  root  420 Sep 26 11:16 ..\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 a\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 b\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 c\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 d\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 e\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david   0 Sep 26 11:15 f\r\n    -rw-r--r--  1 david david 111 Sep 22 22:08 file\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ bash quicktar.sh tmpd myfiles\r\n\r\nThe archive is created:\r\n\r\n    $ ls -al myfiles_update_2019-09-26.tar.xz\r\n    -rw-r--r-- 1 david david 460 Sep 26 11:16 myfiles_update_2019-09-26.tar.xz\r\n\r\nFinally check the content of the compressed archive:\r\n\r\n    $ tar -tJf myfiles_update_2019-09-26.tar.xz\r\n    tmpd/a\r\n    tmpd/b\r\n    tmpd/c\r\n    tmpd/d\r\n    tmpd/e\r\n    tmpd/f\r\n    tmpd/file\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if that is what you intended. You can drop compression or change the type just by changing the `-J` option in the command above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120605/how-to-use-tar-with-an-argument-in-the-path/58121116#58121116","title":"How to use tar with an argument in the path"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12126137,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0455e7ccec5a752c2f695fb56de271c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"prince12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12126137/prince12"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569515295,"creation_date":1569513378,"question_id":58120605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120605","body_markdown":"I am trying to tar some files into a destination, where FILES path and DESTINATION were entered as arguments ($1 and $2): script FILE DEST\r\n\r\nI want to tar the files into the destination and change the name (ex: add the word &quot;update&quot; and the date at the end of the filename) at the end of the new tar file\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo I have: date=date dest=$2 files=&quot;$1/*&quot; #considers all the files within the directory given, as files is a . directory containing one or more files tar $dest/&quot;update&quot;$date $files\r\n\r\nhowever, this does not work, and I get the error: tar: Old option &#39;u&#39; requires an argument (as in the u in &quot;update&quot; I assume)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120605/how-to-use-tar-with-an-argument-in-the-path","title":"How to use tar with an argument in the path"},{"tags":["spring","csv","service","download","controller"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":536,"user_id":8534285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2AXH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ajay Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8534285/ajay-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569529019,"post_id":58120603,"comment_id":102636885,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120603/downloading-csv-file-with-spring-boot#comment102636885_58120603"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11830733,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c0cabdd8bf52df52e70f36b3d99d3f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"miriam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11830733/miriam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":536,"user_id":8534285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K2AXH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ajay Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8534285/ajay-kumar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569543318,"creation_date":1569513369,"last_edit_date":1569543318,"question_id":58120603,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120603","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Spring boot 1.5, I&#39;m trying to dwonload csv file with specific informations, like it&#39;s shown in my service.

In the ReportViewer.aspx page it has a plain white background for the toolbar, the background is white, and the controls are in a small boxed section to the left rather than extending the full length of the toolbar.\r\n\r\nI could probably change this via settings slowly, but it seems like I should just be able to set it to use the same settings it uses on the ReportServer&#39;s ReportViewer.aspx page somehow, I just have not figured out how.

In a nutshell, what in python you write like:\r\n\r\n    from package import module as alias_mod\r\n\r\nin importlib it becomes:\r\n\r\n    alias_mod = importlib.import_module(&#39;module&#39;, &#39;package&#39;)\r\n\r\nor, equivalentelly:\r\n\r\n    alias_mod = importlib.import_module(&#39;module.package&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n    from numpy import random as rm\r\n\r\nin importlib:\r\n     \r\n    rm = importlib.import_module(&#39;random&#39;, &#39;numpy&#39;)\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing is this code proposed in [this post][2], which allows you to import not only modules and packages but also directly functions and more:\r\n\r\n    def import_from(module, name):\r\n        module = __import__(module, fromlist=[name])\r\n        return getattr(module, name)\r\n\r\nFor your specific case, this code should work:\r\n    \r\n    import importlib\r\n    \r\n    n_conf = 3\r\n    for in range(1, n_conf)\r\n        conf = importlib.import_module(&#39;config_file.config_&#39;+str(i))\r\n        # todo somethings with conf \r\n\r\nHowever, if I can give you some advice I think the best thing for you is to build a json configuration file and read the file instead of importing modules. It&#39;s much more comfortable. For example in your case, you can create a `config.json` file like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;config_1&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;folder&quot;: &quot;raw1&quot;,\r\n            &#39;start_date&#39;: &#39;2019-07-01&#39;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;config_2&quot;: {\r\n            &#39;folder&#39;: &#39;raw2&#39;,\r\n            &#39;start_date&#39;: &#39;2019-08-01&#39;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;config_3&quot;: {\r\n            &#39;folder&#39;: &#39;raw3&#39;,\r\n            &#39;start_date&#39;: &#39;2019-09-01&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the json file as follows:\r\n\r\n    import json\r\n    with open(&#39;config.json&#39;) as json_data_file:\r\n        conf = json.load(json_data_file)\r\n\r\nNow you have in memory a simple python dictionary with the configuration settings that interest you:\r\n\r\n    conf[&#39;config_1&#39;]\r\n    # output: {&#39;folder&#39;: &#39;raw1&#39;, &#39;start_date&#39;: &#39;2019-07-01&#39;}\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.html#importlib.import_module\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/8790077/9302488","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120575/import-dictionary-in-loop-in-python/58121091#58121091","title":"Import dictionary in loop in Python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1463,"user_id":4913108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b27233db222cdabfe9c7d2c5f8bc2c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gaurav Bansal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4913108/gaurav-bansal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1463,"user_id":4913108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b27233db222cdabfe9c7d2c5f8bc2c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gaurav Bansal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4913108/gaurav-bansal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570111410,"last_edit_date":1570111410,"creation_date":1569517657,"answer_id":58121663,"question_id":58120575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58121663","body_markdown":"Based on @MikeMajara&#39;s comment, the following solution worked for me:\r\n\r\n    package = &#39;config_file&#39;\r\n    configs = [&#39;config_1&#39;, &#39;config_2&#39;, &#39;config_3&#39;]\r\n    for i in configs:\r\n        cfg = getattr(__import__(package, fromlist=[configs]), i)\r\n        Do some stuff using &#39;folder&#39; and &#39;start_date&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120575/import-dictionary-in-loop-in-python/58121663#58121663","title":"Import dictionary in loop in Python"}],"owner":{"reputation":1463,"user_id":4913108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b27233db222cdabfe9c7d2c5f8bc2c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gaurav Bansal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4913108/gaurav-bansal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1463,"user_id":4913108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b27233db222cdabfe9c7d2c5f8bc2c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gaurav Bansal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4913108/gaurav-bansal"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58121091,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570111410,"creation_date":1569513237,"last_edit_date":1569517616,"question_id":58120575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120575","body_markdown":"My question is related to this [one][1].

in the process of creating a new windows desktop app with Prism 7, and I started out with the new `PrismApplication` base class that replaced the bootstrapper. Everything was fine until I created the (specflow-)tests.\r\n\r\nI was used to re-using the original bootstrapper during initialization of the test-app, just modifying the registrations afterwards. That, transformed to the new `Application` derived system looks like this:\r\n\r\n    internal partial class App\r\n    {\r\n        protected override IContainerExtension CreateContainerExtension()\r\n        {\r\n            var containerExtension = new Prism.Unity.Ioc.UnityContainerExtension();\r\n            containerExtension.Instance.AddExtension( new LogExtension() );\r\n            return containerExtension;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected override Window CreateShell()\r\n        {\r\n            return Container.Resolve&lt;MainWindow&gt;();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected override void RegisterTypes( IContainerRegistry containerRegistry )\r\n        {\r\n            containerRegistry.Register&lt;IConfiguration, AppSettingsConfiguration&gt;();\r\n            containerRegistry.Register&lt;IWindowsInterface, WindowsInterface&gt;();\r\n            // ... a lot of registrations removed here ...\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd a derived test-app that does everything but create the shell:\r\n\r\n    private class MyApp : App\r\n    {\r\n        protected override Window CreateShell()\r\n        {\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWrapped up in a `BeforeScenario` hook to initialize the test-app:\r\n\r\n    [BeforeScenario]\r\n    public void InitializeApp()\r\n    {\r\n        var app = new MyApp();\r\n        app.Initialize();\r\n        var containerRegistry = (IContainerRegistry)app.Container;\r\n\r\n        containerRegistry.RegisterSingleton&lt;TestWindowsInterface&gt;();\r\n        containerRegistry.Register&lt;IWindowsInterface,TestWindowsInterface&gt;();\r\n        // ... some registration overrides removed here ...\r\n\r\n        _objectContainer.RegisterInstanceAs&lt;App&gt;( app );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd a step to create the main window (`CreateShell` replacement):\r\n\r\n    [When( @&quot;I start the software&quot; )]\r\n    public void WhenIStartTheSoftware()\r\n    {\r\n        _container.RegisterInstanceAs( _container.Resolve&lt;App&gt;().Container.Resolve&lt;MainWindowViewModel&gt;() );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo far, so good, this works. But only as long as you have just one scenario. As soon as the second scenario starts, we get an exception:\r\n\r\n    Cannot create more than one System.Windows.Application instance in the same AppDomain.\r\n\r\nIn the old days, this wasn&#39;t a problem, because the `Bootstrapper` was just a regular class, as opposed to the `PrismApplication` which is enforced to be a singleton by the framework.\r\n\r\nOf course, I can move the whole registration stuff into a regular class, and use that to initialize the test-app, but this means essentially creating my own version of the bootstrapper _on top_ of the `PrismApplication`. Using the classic `Bootstrapper` makes more sense to me, yet it will be dropped in a future release (as it&#39;s marked obsolete today).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120554/how-to-create-a-spec-flow-test-for-a-prism-7-app","title":"How to create a Spec-Flow test for a Prism 7 app?"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513454,"post_id":58120552,"comment_id":102629929,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120552/is-there-a-way-to-cut-a-large-ggplot-in-two-three-y-axis-to-acomodate-for-prin#comment102629929_58120552"},{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12078127,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c96d12a0476280a5f53d8de4e87f2c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caelstrasz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078127/caelstrasz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569568562,"post_id":58120552,"comment_id":102646387,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120552/is-there-a-way-to-cut-a-large-ggplot-in-two-three-y-axis-to-acomodate-for-prin#comment102646387_58120552"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12078127,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c96d12a0476280a5f53d8de4e87f2c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caelstrasz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078127/caelstrasz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569513164,"creation_date":1569513164,"question_id":58120552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120552","body_markdown":"I have a really large data set and the scatter plot I made with ggplot2 is really large too.

This is a Boolean value.\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst Names = //the main array, that I split the others off of.\r\n  [{name:&#39;Paul&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:33,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {name:&#39;Michelle&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:32,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {name:&#39;Erik&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:30,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;Ruth&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:69,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;patty&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:59,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;Steve&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:60,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;mike&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:73,&#39;found&#39;:true}]\r\n//split the main array into smaller arrays based on the key &#39;found&#39;\r\nuseEffect(()=&gt;{\r\n\t \tconsole.log(&#39;this&#39;)\r\n\t Names.map((people,index)=&gt;{\r\n\t \tif(people[&#39;found&#39;]){\r\n\t \t\tone.push({people,index});\r\n\t \t} else {\r\n\t \t\ttwo.push({people,index});\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t })\r\n\t setOneLst(one);\r\n\t setTwoLst(two);\r\n\t},[])\r\n```\r\nThese arrays are then rendered as list items with a checkbox.  When the user clicks in the checkbox, I update the value of the key `found` to be the opposite of what it was.  In the following code I am also changing the name.  I do not need that, I am just using it as a test.\r\n```JavaScript\r\nconst NameChange = (state,action)=&gt;{\r\n\t \tswitch(action.type){\r\n\t \t\tcase &#39;FOUND&#39;:\r\n\t \t\tconsole.log(action.index)\r\n\t \t\treturn state.map((people,index)=&gt;{\r\n\t \t\t\tif(index===action.index){\r\n\t \t\t\t\t people[&#39;found&#39;]=!people[&#39;found&#39;]\r\n\t \t\t\t\tpeople[&#39;name&#39;]=&#39;test&#39;;\r\n\t \t\t\t\treturn people\r\n\t \t\t\t} else { \r\n\t \t\t\t\treturn people\r\n\t \t\t\t}\r\n\t \t\t})\r\n\t \t\tdefault: return state;\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t }\r\n```\r\nAll of this works so far.  However, the issue that I am having is when a user clicks the checkbox, and it updates, I would also like the corresponding arrays to change as well.  For example: if a user clicks the box corresponding to `Paul` it would then change the `name` value to `test` and the `found` value `false`.  This it currently does.  However, I then would want to show it in array `two` because it `found:false`.\r\n\r\nthis is the entire code:\r\n```JavaScript\r\nimport React, {useState,useEffect,useReducer} from &#39;react&#39;;\t  \r\n const one=[];\r\n const two=[];\r\n const Names = [{name:&#39;Paul&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:33,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {name:&#39;Michelle&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:32,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {name:&#39;Erik&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:30,&#39;found&#39;:true},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;ruth&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:69,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;patty&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:59,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;steve&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:60,&#39;found&#39;:false},\r\n  {&#39;name&#39;:&#39;mike&#39;,&#39;age&#39;:73,&#39;found&#39;:true}]\r\n  const NameChange = (state,action)=&gt;{\r\n\t \tswitch(action.type){\r\n\t \t\tcase &#39;FOUND&#39;:\r\n\t \t\tconsole.log(action.index)\r\n\t \t\treturn state.map((people,index)=&gt;{\r\n\t \t\t\tif(index===action.index){\r\n\t \t\t\t\t people[&#39;found&#39;]=!people[&#39;found&#39;]\r\n\t \t\t\t\tpeople[&#39;name&#39;]=&#39;test&#39;;\r\n\t \t\t\t\treturn people\r\n\t \t\t\t} else { \r\n\t \t\t\t\treturn people\r\n\t \t\t\t}\r\n\t \t\t})\r\n\t \t\tdefault: return state;\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t }\r\n const App=()=&gt;{\r\n \tconst [peoples, dispatch] = useReducer(NameChange, Names);\r\n \tconst handleFind = idx =&gt;{\r\n \t\tdispatch({type:&#39;FOUND&#39;,index:idx})\r\n \t};\t \r\n\t //const [nameLst, setnameLst] = useState(Names);\r\n\t const [oneLst, setOneLst] = useState([]);\r\n\t const [twoLst, setTwoLst] = useState([]);\r\n\t useEffect(()=&gt;{\r\n\t \tconsole.log(&#39;this&#39;)\r\n\t Names.map((people,index)=&gt;{\r\n\t \tif(people[&#39;found&#39;]){\r\n\t \t\tone.push({people,index});\r\n\t \t} else {\r\n\t \t\ttwo.push({people,index});\r\n\t \t}\r\n\t })\r\n\t setOneLst(one);\r\n\t setTwoLst(two);\r\n\t},[])\r\n\tconsole.log(one);\r\n\treturn(\r\n\t\t&lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;h1&gt;Hello World&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;p&gt;Lets make some magic:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tone.map((people,index)=&gt;(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;li key={index}&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkBox&quot; checked={people[&#39;people&#39;][&#39;found&#39;]} onChange={()=&gt;handleFind(people[&#39;index&#39;])}/&gt;{people[&#39;people&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]}&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t))\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t&lt;div&gt;&lt;h1&gt;List 2:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\t\t\t{\t\r\n\t\t\t\ttwo.map((people,index)=&gt;(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t&lt;li key={index}&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkBox&quot; checked={people[&#39;people&#39;][&#39;found&#39;]} onChange={()=&gt;handleFind(people[&#39;index&#39;])}/&gt;{people[&#39;people&#39;][&#39;name&#39;]}&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t\t\t\t))\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\t)\r\n };\r\n export default App;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120548/react-problem-rendering-array-change-from-usereducer","title":"react problem rendering array change from useReducer"},{"tags":["python-3.x"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12126112,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBiH8VUnDmCzJP5bafMf_Jj0BkX8SffJdxffhVk=k-s128","display_name":"Nio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12126112/nio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569513141,"creation_date":1569513141,"question_id":58120546,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120546","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using loguru lib for tracing errors (@logger.catch) in inner tool.

But a lot of those legal sounding notices are completely unenforceable, they&#39;re just there to scare people. In general, once someone sends something without a prior agreement, the receiver owns it entirely, as long as the sender has ownership of it. That is regardless of whether the sender changes their mind after the fact. Post conditions, which you can only read after receiving something even if they are sent at the same time, are not a prior agreement (you need the option to decline) before the transaction).\r\n\r\nThe important part is what rights the sender has. It&#39;s possible the sender doesn&#39;t have the rights to ask you to use the key as they asked you to. Again, a lawyer can clarify, I don&#39;t think you would be liable for that infraction, but the notice might be enough to mean you &quot;should have known&quot;, and might have some liability.\r\n\r\nEven better, ask your customer for clarification. I&#39;m surprised you didn&#39;t do that in the first place. If they offer to indemnify you - that is, take responsibility for all liability you might incur by violating that notice - you should be in the clear, providing a lawyer agrees.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll say &quot;lawyer&quot; again, because the legal system takes about ten years full time study for a lawyer to just get started knowing it well enough to start practicing, and decades longer to get good at it.

might find success and use cases beyond this one by maintaining a user&#39;s feed and then only calling that at runtime. I utilize this method and have found I&#39;m given a lot of freedom and Cloud Functions let me dictate what types of posts show and under what changes are new posts added to a user&#39;s feed.\r\n\r\nThe way I do it is I look for new posts via an onCreate cloud function and then look up who should see that post, etc. and add it to each of their feeds.\r\n\r\nIn your case I can see it being used by looking for new likes on a post. On new likes, it can remove the post from the user&#39;s feed.\r\n\r\nAn example of a function (edited for brevity) that I use to add posts to the user&#39;s follower&#39;s feeds. By grabbing using a collectionGroup query I can query the list of all users who follow the author of the post.\r\n\r\nThe schema looks like this:\r\n\r\n    Users (collection)\r\n    --- User1 (document)\r\n    ------- Following (collection of people User1 is following)\r\n    ----------- FollowingUser1 (document, contains a uid of &quot;followed&quot; user)\r\n    ----------- FollowingUser2\r\n\r\nand the Cloud Function:\r\n\r\n    exports.newReview =  functions.firestore\r\n      .document(&#39;reviews/{reviewId}&#39;)\r\n      .onCreate((snap, context) =&gt; {\r\n          var reviewId = context.params.reviewId\r\n          var reviewData = snap.data()\r\n          var userFollowers = db.collectionGroup(&#39;following&#39;).where(&#39;uid&#39;, &#39;==&#39;, userId)\r\n          var followingTransaction = db.runTransaction(transaction =&gt; {\r\n            return transaction.get(userFollowers).then(restDocs =&gt; {\r\n              reviewData[&#39;added_via&#39;] = &#39;following&#39;\r\n              restDocs.forEach(doc =&gt; {\r\n                var followerId = doc.ref.parent.parent.id\r\n                var followerRef = db.collection(`feeds/${followerId}/posts`).doc(reviewId)\r\n                transaction.set(followerRef, reviewData);\r\n              })\r\n                return true\r\n            }); \r\n          });\r\n    \r\n         return followingTransaction.then(values =&gt; {\r\n              console.log(reviewData)\r\n                var shouldPostToTwitter = reviewData.postToTwitter\r\n                return Promise.resolve()\r\n              }) .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(error)\r\n                return Promise.reject(new Error(&quot;Error deleting&quot;));\r\n              });\r\n      });\r\n\r\n\r\nDB look something look this:\r\n\r\n    admin.initializeApp({\r\n      credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount),\r\n      databaseURL\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    const db = admin.firestore()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120524/firestore-subcollection-query/58120726#58120726","title":"Firestore Subcollection &#39;!=&#39; query"}],"owner":{"reputation":444,"user_id":8840085,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2OYKk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Casey West","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840085/casey-west"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58120726,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569624241,"creation_date":1569513077,"question_id":58120524,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120524","body_markdown":"I am aware Firestore doesn&#39;t support &#39;!=&#39; queries, but I was wondering if anybody has run into a similar situation as below:\r\n\r\nHere is my db structure:\r\n\r\n    Posts -&gt; postId -&gt; postDocument -&gt; likedBy -&gt; uid\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking to do is only show posts that don&#39;t have the current user&#39;s uid in the &#39;likedBy&#39; subcollection.

There is a variable `checkbox_state` which is tested but not set? And, you seem to test if the value of `is(&#39;:checked&#39;)` returns the string `0` or `1`. While this works, if you test this manually in the console, or check the documentation, you would see it returns `true` or `false`, so that could make your code a lot simpler too.\r\n\r\nSo I would write your code as follows:\r\n\r\n      if(checkbox_id == (queue_notification)) {\r\n        checkbox_state = $(&#39;input#user_hop_queue_notification&#39;).is(&#39;:checked&#39;); \r\n        if(checkbox_state) {\r\n          if(Notification.requestPermissionre !== &quot;granted&quot;){\r\n              Notification.requestPermission(function(status) {\r\n                console.log(&#39;Notification permission status:&#39;, status);\r\n              });\r\n          } \r\n        } else {\r\n          if(Notification.requestPermission !== &quot;denied&quot;){\r\n              Notification.requestPermission(function(status) {\r\n                console.log(&#39;Notification permission status:&#39;, status);\r\n              });\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I understood your intention correctly, this should work more as expected. We could refactor the `check_state` variable away, as we have no further use for it (but for now I wanted to stay closer to your original code)(it might still improve readability, so that would be a good reason to keep it, however the `is(:checked)` is pretty self-explanatory on its own).\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are trying to _set_ the checked state, you should use the following code: \r\n\r\n     $(&#39;input#user_hop_queue_notification&#39;).prop(&#39;checked&#39;, true);\r\n\r\n(if not obvious, true will &quot;check&quot; the checkbox, false will uncheck).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58120518/how-to-verify-if-a-check-box-is-checked/58131818#58131818","title":"How to verify if a check box is checked?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12086311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8757bbff7f712486d543afe7726b60f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nmp153","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086311/nmp153"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12086311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8757bbff7f712486d543afe7726b60f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nmp153","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086311/nmp153"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569577485,"creation_date":1569513066,"last_edit_date":1569530070,"question_id":58120518,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58120518","body_markdown":"I am currently trying to make my checkbox show a popup for browser notifications if it is checked.
