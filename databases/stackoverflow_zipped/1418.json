I tried putting that code directly in header.php, that didn&#39;t work wither. \r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;meeting-button&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!-- ScheduleOnce button START --&gt;\r\n    &lt;button id=&quot;SOIBTN_ELAMeeting&quot; style=&quot;background: #ffab40; cursor: pointer;&quot; data-height=&quot;580&quot; data-psz=&quot;00&quot; data-so-page=&quot;ELAMeeting&quot; data-delay=&quot;1&quot;&gt;Schedule a Meeting&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.oncehub.com/mergedjs/so.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- ScheduleOnce button END --&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the code that shows live with the onclick action----\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;meeting-button&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!-- ScheduleOnce button START --&gt;\r\n    &lt;button id=&quot;SOIBTN_ELAMeeting&quot; style=&quot;background: #ffab40; cursor: pointer;&quot; data-height=&quot;580&quot; data-psz=&quot;00&quot; data-so-page=&quot;ELAMeeting&quot; data-delay=&quot;1&quot; onclick=&quot;return soe.toggleLightBox(&amp;quot;ELAMeeting&amp;quot;)&quot; data-so-done=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Schedule a Meeting&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;https://cdn.oncehub.com/mergedjs/so.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- ScheduleOnce button END --&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not great at javascript so not sure if I am missing something here.

It receives requests coming from browsers \r\n 2. It copies the request contents including its headers into a new httpClient \r\n 3. It uses the httpClient to call a backend server\r\n 4. It sends the response back to the browser\r\n\r\nIt works fine when the original request contains only ASCII chars, but when it does not I get an error:\r\n\r\n&gt; Request headers must contain only ASCII characters\r\n\r\nIs there any way to have non-ASCII headers when making requests to a server using an httpClient? I thought about encoding the headers as Base64 when I am copying the request headers, like this:\r\n\r\n    var encoded_header = Convert.ToBase64String(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(header_value));\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure if the destination server will be able to decode it. In addition, since I have no idea what the headers coming fro browsers are I would have to encode them all, including the ones such as Content-Type.

Give it a google and you will find Magic there.\r\n\r\nBonus: Please, use destructure and assignment in order to extract `{ Component }` and there is no need to use the `.bind` anymore.\r\n\r\nThese tips might help you code like a pro!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204821/display-the-status-of-each-test-while-running/58204993#58204993","title":"Display the status of each test while running"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":9918042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RdMZQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"newDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9918042/newdev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":50,"user_id":9918042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RdMZQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"newDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9918042/newdev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570037333,"creation_date":1570030639,"last_edit_date":1570037333,"question_id":58204821,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204821","body_markdown":"I have a list component.\r\nthis component receives data from a dataset. \r\nWhen, for each test a callback function is run, \r\nthe state (testStatus) is updated.\r\nThe console.log(testStatus) logs the following \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBut I am drawing a blank on how to access them and update the UI accordingly.\r\nAny help is really appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to display the different statuses in the UI. \r\nSo when running display &#39;test is running&#39; \r\nWhen fail display &#39;Test failed&#39;.\r\nWhen passed display &#39;Test Succeeded&#39;.\r\nWhen all tests are done running, display \r\n&#39;All tests are done running&#39; \r\n \r\n\r\n```\r\n             {!clicked &amp;&amp; (\r\n                    &lt;span style={{ background: &quot;grey&quot; }}&gt;\r\n                      Test did not run yet\r\n                    &lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  )}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the list component \r\nwhere the data set is imported and where the callback is invoked.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\nimport &quot;./App.css&quot;;\r\nimport tests from &quot;../constants/tests/tests&quot;;\r\n\r\nclass TestsList extends React.Component {\r\n  constructor(props) {\r\n    super(props);\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      clicked: false,\r\n      testStatus: {},\r\n      tests: tests\r\n    };\r\n    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  uniqueId() {\r\n    tests.map((test, index) =&gt; {\r\n      let uniqId = parseInt(index);\r\n      return Object.assign(test, { id: uniqId });\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  handleClick(event) {\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n    this.uniqueId();\r\n    this.setState({ clicked: true });\r\n    tests.map(test =&gt; {\r\n      test.run(x =&gt;\r\n        this.setState({\r\n          testStatus: {\r\n            ...this.state.testStatus,\r\n            [test.id]: x ?

But what puzzles me is the usage of `or` in the last line. The function is not a Boolean type. Is it alright to use `or` here?\r\n\r\nAlso one C++ answer is here:\r\n```C++\r\nclass Solution {\r\npublic:\r\n    vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt; &gt; pathSum(TreeNode *root, int sum) {\r\n        vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt; res;\r\n        vector&lt;int&gt; out;\r\n        helper(root, sum, out, res);\r\n        return res;\r\n    }\r\n    void helper(TreeNode* node, int sum, vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; out, vector&lt;vector&lt;int&gt;&gt;&amp; res) {\r\n        if (!node) return;\r\n        out.push_back(node-&gt;val);\r\n        if (sum == node-&gt;val &amp;&amp; !node-&gt;left &amp;&amp; !node-&gt;right) {\r\n            res.push_back(out);\r\n        }\r\n        helper(node-&gt;left, sum - node-&gt;val, out, res);\r\n        helper(node-&gt;right, sum - node-&gt;val, out, res);\r\n        out.pop_back();\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nNotice `helper` function is invoked twice in its inner function body.\r\n\r\n**So to sum up my questions:**  \r\n\r\n 1. the Python function `helper` doesn&#39;t appear to be a Boolean type. How can it can be used with `or` keyword?\r\n 2. Will `or` cause the `helper` function to be short-circuited thus resulting a different behavior as C++ version does. If not, how can it be?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204816/use-of-or-for-return-in-python","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Use of &#39;or&#39; for return in Python"},{"tags":["python","latitude-longitude","hdf","satellite-image"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mTMqr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ek_prime","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154599/ek-prime"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570030602,"creation_date":1570030602,"question_id":58204815,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204815","body_markdown":"I want to extract cmk (cloud mask) values for a particular latitude and longitude from INSAT3D satellite data using Python 3\r\n\r\nI know how to read the hdf file where the latitude and longitude values are explicit.

You could also try if you want to: Spring Data Redis repository is [here](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-redis/) and you should be easily able to find contribution guidelines there.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the last question: this happens due to how the key(s) to be evicted are calculated based off of this property.\r\nA prefix from the property is prepended to what you specify in `@Cacheable.key` annotation attribute and so the resulting key that&#39;ll be stored in Redis knows nothing about the cache name set in `@Cacheable.value`. When it comes to the cache eviction wildcard pattern (`*`) is prefixed with what was specified in the configuration. In your example the key(s) to be removed are: `prefix:tiles:*`.\r\n\r\nI think that if the cache name were appended to a prefix you wouldn&#39;t have an issue (e.g. `prefix:tiles:cacheName:253903999`, where `prefix:tiles:` is a global prefix and `cacheName` is obviously a cache name). Prefix is applied here: `org.springframework.data.redis.cache.RedisCacheConfiguration#prefixKeysWith` and the key(s) to be removed are calculated using this function:  `org.springframework.data.redis.cache.RedisCacheConfiguration#getKeyPrefixFor`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204799/spring-data-redis-cachenames-dont-work-if-key-prefix-is-present/58209348#58209348","title":"spring-data-redis cacheNames don&#39;t work if key-prefix is present"}],"owner":{"reputation":178,"user_id":10440388,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1OPBlmStXfw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DUg8-ND1wzwPO8IM2qub6mWL8IM2A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tyulpan Tyulpan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10440388/tyulpan-tyulpan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":178,"user_id":10440388,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1OPBlmStXfw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DUg8-ND1wzwPO8IM2qub6mWL8IM2A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tyulpan Tyulpan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10440388/tyulpan-tyulpan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570050315,"creation_date":1570030553,"last_edit_date":1570031067,"question_id":58204799,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204799","body_markdown":"Assuming I have `spring-data-redis` application with the following method:\r\n\r\n    @Cacheable(\r\n        value = &quot;cacheName&quot;,\r\n        key = &quot;T(java.lang.String).format(&#39;tiles:%s&#39;, #categories.hashCode())&quot;)\r\n    public List&lt;Tile&gt; findAll(Set&lt;String&gt; categories) {\r\n        return findAllByCategories(categories);\r\n    }\r\nThe entries saved to Redis as following:\r\n\r\n    cacheName::tiles:253903999\r\n\r\nNow I can evict this cache from another method:\r\n\r\n    @CacheEvict(value = &quot;cacheName&quot;, allEntries = true)\r\n    public Optional&lt;Tile&gt; save(Tile entity) {\r\n        return super.save(entity);\r\n    }\r\nAnd everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nBut setting property `spring.cache.redis.key-prefix=prefix:` gives me the following entry in Redis:\r\n\r\n    prefix:tiles:253903999\r\nCache cannot be evicted now since there are no information about cacheName. \r\n\r\nWhy should not it create the following entry:\r\n\r\n    cacheName::prefix:tiles:253903999\r\nIs it possible to fix this?

Are the calculated P values useful to calculate the P(X&gt;x, Y&gt;y, Z&gt;z)?\r\n\r\n\r\n    #Original data \r\n    df &lt;- data.frame (X,Y,Z)\r\n    # Transformed data\r\n    dg &lt;- pobs(df,ties.method = &quot;first&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    U &lt;-data.frame(&quot;X&quot;=dg[,1], &quot;Y&quot;=dg[,2], &quot;Z&quot;=dg[,3])\r\n    U &lt;- as.matrix(U)\r\n    UXY &lt;- data.frame(&quot;X&quot;=dg[,1],&quot;Y&quot;=dg[,2])\r\n    UXY &lt;- as.matrix(UXY)\r\n    UXZ &lt;- data.frame(&quot;X&quot;=dg[,1],&quot;Z&quot;=dg[,3])\r\n    UXZ &lt;- as.matrix(UXZ)\r\n    UYZ &lt;- data.frame(&quot;Y&quot;=dg[,2],&quot;Z&quot;=dg[,3])\r\n    UYZ &lt;- as.matrix(UYZ)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    # trivariate copula X,Y,Z\r\n    f3 &lt;- frankCopula(5.27,dim = 3)\r\n    multicop &lt;- pCopula(U, f3)\r\n    \r\n    # Bivariate copula X, Y\r\n    fXY &lt;- frankCopula(4.7)\r\n    bicop_XY &lt;- pCopula(UXY, fXY)\r\n    \r\n    # Bivariate copula X, Z\r\n    fXZ &lt;- frankCopula(10.1)\r\n    bicop_XZ &lt;- pCopula(UXZ, fXZ)\r\n    \r\n    # Bivariate copula Z, Y\r\n    fZY &lt;- frankCopula(4.71)\r\n    bicop_ZY &lt;- pCopula(UZY, fZY)\r\n    \r\n    # now the exceedance probability is based on this: \r\n    # P(X&gt;x, Y&gt;y, Z&gt;z)=p(u`,v`,z`)=1-u-v-z+c(u,v)+c(u,z)+c(z,v)-c(u,v,z)\r\n    \r\n    p &lt;- 1 - U[,1] - U[,2] - U[,3] + bicop_XY + bicop_XZ + bicop_YZ - multicop\r\n\r\nNow, I have the probability for each combination of X, Y, and Z (3672 values for P).

The organization restricts most average users access to altering their workstations, and I am in progress of writing some productivity software. Their workstations are generally either Windows 7 or Windows 10. (and before asked, My management is aware and supporting this development, so skirting the UAC and installing is not as evasive as it may seem. Formal adoption may happen upon several successful tests I am trying to perform.)\r\n\r\nThe problem I have run into is that in order to add some quality of life features to the program, I employed the solution from MoonKnight laid out in [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11309827/window-application-flash-like-orange-on-taskbar-when-minimize][1] .The issue I am now having that the uninstall process for this application now requires UAC as it seems to be modifying a windows host process. \r\n\r\nThe UAC prompt cites that I am allowing &quot;Windows Host Process (Rundll32)&quot; by Microsoft Windows to make changes to the device, with &quot;dfshim.dll.ShArpMaintain&quot; cited as part of my program.\r\n\r\nNow I could be wrong with where I am looking as I have, at best intermediate experience with click-once applications. Additionally, I would naturally look at the last thing I added as being the most likely culprit to causing this. \r\n\r\nThe base question is: \r\n\r\n •  A) Am I looking in the right place? \r\n\r\n •  B) Is there a clean way to disconnect the program from this process so the user is not prompted with a UAC prompt during uninstall while retaining the task bar flash feature?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11309827/window-application-flash-like-orange-on-taskbar-when-minimize","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204773/uac-on-a-clickonce-uninstall","title":"UAC on a Clickonce uninstall"},{"tags":["javascript","html","ajax","google-chrome"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570032497,"post_id":58204772,"comment_id":102788741,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204772/run-script-only-on-specific-urls-on-ajax-website#comment102788741_58204772"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12129530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c402520b8b1fff148f84085b172fe26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CODER11713","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12129530/coder11713"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570037546,"post_id":58204772,"comment_id":102791098,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204772/run-script-only-on-specific-urls-on-ajax-website#comment102791098_58204772"},{"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570038199,"post_id":58204772,"comment_id":102791391,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204772/run-script-only-on-specific-urls-on-ajax-website#comment102791391_58204772"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12129530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c402520b8b1fff148f84085b172fe26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CODER11713","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12129530/coder11713"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4205,"user_id":3682162,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100004313019228/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vikrant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3682162/vikrant"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570075159,"creation_date":1570030450,"last_edit_date":1570075159,"question_id":58204772,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204772","body_markdown":"Trying to run script in my extension only on specific URLs.\r\n\r\nThe website is in AJAX and for some reason, when my background scripts check if it&#39;s the URL, it sends the message to content script and the content script executes.

order processing software keeps the most recent values of things like sales value in the transactional table, and creates a row in an audit table whenever there is a change (including timestamp, before value, after value). For reporting purposes I want to be able to find the initial value, then step through each change to end up at the current value. \r\n\r\nHowever, the system only saves changes periodically, and I&#39;m not sure how but it will occasionally save them to the database (and so timestamp them) out of order.\r\n\r\nI would like to iterate over these rows and determine the true order of updates based on both timestamp proximity and before/after values.\r\n\r\nThis is an example of the changes to the gross sales value of an order over time:\r\n```\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+\r\n|    date_created     | before_value_string | after_value_string |\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+\r\n| 2019-09-04 12:48:36 |                 438 |                876 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 12:48:43 |                 876 |               1314 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 12:48:43 |                   0 |                438 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 12:49:48 |                1314 |               1752 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 14:00:35 |                1752 |               1314 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 14:00:49 |                1314 |                876 |\r\n| 2019-09-04 14:00:55 |                 876 |                438 |\r\n| 2019-09-05 09:03:50 |                 438 |                538 |\r\n+---------------------+---------------------+--------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the before_value_string field, it is clear that row 3 should in fact be first.

You&#39;ll need to handle the user input and such, but never be afraid to break the problem down. Start with a program which can print x amount of digits for your input in a variable form, then work on the input. You could put something like this right in a method `printDigitsPI(int decimals)`. Most of the used variables above are constants, they won&#39;t change and don&#39;t need to be passed around.\r\n\r\nAs a last peice of advice, if you ever find yourself writing `num1`, `num2`, `num3`... as variables, there is quite likely a better way to go about it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204761/how-can-i-stop-printing-a-string-at-a-varying-index/58206098#58206098","title":"How can I stop printing a string at a varying index?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12149280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCYYQ7Pm8cYwjSvqVRe4t0mQaTXVSwvNvGYgsLu=k-s128","display_name":"3rDuck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12149280/3rduck"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12149280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCYYQ7Pm8cYwjSvqVRe4t0mQaTXVSwvNvGYgsLu=k-s128","display_name":"3rDuck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12149280/3rduck"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58206098,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570041458,"creation_date":1570030423,"last_edit_date":1570034253,"question_id":58204761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204761","body_markdown":"As a starter project, I&#39;m making a code that writes out digits of pi. The code prompts for an int, and prints that many decimal places of pi, which uses a predetermined string. The problem is that each individual digit is on a separate line, like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;3  \r\n.  \r\n1  \r\n4  \r\n1  \r\n5  \r\n9\r\n\r\nThat code used a *for* loop that ends at the index that is given by the scanner. It printed one character at a time. I&#39;m struggling to find a way to make the code print ten-digit substrings of pi separately, each on their own line, meaning 26 digits would be printed like this:\r\n\r\n&gt;3 .  \r\n1415926535  \r\n8979323846  \r\n264338\r\n\r\nThat is two sets of ten, and a third set containing the remaining six. I&#39;m struggling to divide the string printing into groups of ten, and still have the printing stop at the given index, even if that index is not a multiple of ten. In addition, the *for* loop from the old code is being used for a digit counter, so I would like to keep it. Placing &quot;/n&quot; into the string to make spaces interrupts the counting system, as those characters are counted and printed as well, invalidating that option. Thus far I haven&#39;t had any other ideas to fix this. If you know of a way to print in this fashion, let me know.

on your edit, you want to store object references of `listItem` object&#39;s properties.\r\n\r\n    let listItem = {\r\n      name: &quot;Lydia&quot;,\r\n      accountId: &quot;HGVe&quot;,\r\n      fleetType: &quot;Haulage&quot;\r\n    };\r\n\r\nBut this object&#39;s properties are not objects but primitive values. Primitive values don&#39;t have a reference. See this [answer][1] for more information.\r\n\r\nYou can create a string object using [String][2] constructor. And use [Object.values()][3] to get these values.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let listItem = {\r\n      name: new String(&quot;Lydia&quot;),\r\n      accountId: new String(&quot;HGVe&quot;),\r\n      fleetType: new String(&quot;Haulage&quot;)\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let refs = Object.values(listItem);\r\n\r\n    console.log(refs);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nYou now have references stored in an array. You can&#39;t have `[listItem.name, listItem.accountId, listItem.fleetType]` without them getting evaluated to those references.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Previous Answer:**\r\n\r\nYou can wrap this object in another object and use [Object.keys()][4] to get its name.\r\n\r\nThen use `Object.keys()` on original object to get its keys.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let listItem = {\r\n      name: &quot;Lydia&quot;,\r\n      accountId: &quot;HGVe&quot;,\r\n      fleetType: &quot;Haulage&quot;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    var obj = { listItem };\r\n    var name = Object.keys(obj)[0];\r\n    var result = [];\r\n\r\n    Object.keys(listItem).forEach((key) =&gt; {\r\n      result.push(name + &quot;.&quot; + key);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    console.log(result);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; So every element of the array is going to be VariableName.key (not a\r\n&gt; string).\r\n\r\nEvery value should have a [data type][5]. So what would be the data type of these values? They are likely to be strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13266769/2924577\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String\r\n

just have to believe me that this is what&#39;s happening to me and it&#39;s driving me crazy\r\n\r\nBasically, after a series of operation in Jupyter Notebook, I get a dictionary as below\r\n\r\n```\r\ndict1 = {&#39;Cash&#39;: [], &#39;Current Liabilities&#39;: [&#39;overpayment&#39;,&#39;loan&#39;],&#39;Debt&#39;: [&#39;debt1&#39;, &#39;debt2&#39;],\r\n &#39;Dividends Declared&#39;: [],&#39;Fixed Assets&#39;: [] }\r\n```\r\nMy objective is to merge dict1 with dict2 to produce merge_dict below\r\n\r\n```\r\ndict2 = {&#39;Cash&#39;: [&#39;USD&#39;, &#39;CAD&#39;], &#39;Debt&#39;: &#39;debt3&#39;}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nmerge_dict = {&#39;Cash&#39;: [&#39;USD&#39;, &#39;CAD&#39;], &#39;Current Liabilities&#39;: [&#39;overpayment&#39;,&#39;loan&#39;],&#39;Debt&#39;: [&#39;debt1&#39;, &#39;debt2&#39;, &#39;debt3&#39;], &#39;Dividends Declared&#39;: [],&#39;Fixed Assets&#39;: [] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI successfully merge dict1 and dict2 using the code below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor k,v in dict1.items():\r\n    for u, i in dict2.items():\r\n        if k == u:\r\n            if type(i) is list:\r\n                [v.append(e) for e in i]\r\n            else:\r\n                v.append(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s driving me nuts is that the dictionary object I got (depicted as dict1 in this post) in Jupyter Notebook is exactly like dict1, but for some reasons, the produced output is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmerge_dict = {&#39;Cash&#39;: [&#39;USD&#39;, &#39;CAD&#39;], &#39;Current Liabilities&#39;: [&#39;overpayment&#39;,&#39;loan&#39;],&#39;Debt&#39;: [&#39;debt1&#39;, &#39;debt2&#39;, &#39;debt3&#39;], &#39;Dividends Declared&#39;: [&#39;USD&#39;, &#39;CAD&#39;],&#39;Fixed Assets&#39;: [&#39;USD&#39;, &#39;CAD&#39;]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand why &#39;Dividends Declared&#39; and &#39;Fixed Assets&#39; also appended the elements although they are different from dict2&#39;s keys. What&#39;s potentially wrong with the dict object I got that makes it behave differently from dict1?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204752/why-cant-i-merge-these-2-dictionaries","title":"Why can&#39;t I merge these 2 dictionaries?"},{"tags":["python","python-2.7"],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10178473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8db61505d5541fd1b046ba3aa1902bb7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JustAnotherJohnDoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10178473/justanotherjohndoe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25747,"user_id":4354477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SuxtS.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ForceBru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4354477/forcebru"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570030523,"creation_date":1570030369,"last_edit_date":1570030523,"question_id":58204749,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204749","body_markdown":"I just uninstalled python, python2, and python3 from my mac (Mojave 10.14.6).

Because its not a standard Encoding, there&#39;s no way ot know what the charcter codes &#39;mean&#39;. However, the ToUnicode CMap is intended to give you a mapping from character code to Unicode code point.\r\n\r\nTHe ToUnicode CMap is Acrobat (and other viewers) first and best way to extract text.

Obviously that&#39;s a single character code, but it could be a range.\r\n\r\nNow you&#39;ll note that the CMap has &#39;holes&#39; in the ranges, for instance there are no entries for 0x28 and 0x29.\r\n\r\nSo taking your text, the characters are 7, !, &quot;, #, $. Or, in hex 0x37, 0x21, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24 (you can see how the indices have been chosen, the first character in the file is 0x01, the second is 0x02 and so on, so the code to glyph mapping depends on the order the characters are used).\r\n\r\nSo we run those numbers through the ToUnicode CMap, 0x37 maps to... Oops! There is no entry in the CMap for character code 0x37! 0x21 maps to 0x092e, 0x22 to 0x0915, 0x23 to 0x093e and 0x24 maps to 0x0928.\r\n\r\nSo the latter four characters copy and paste correctly. Acrobat (and any other viewer) doesn&#39;t know what to do with character code 0x37, so it does the best it can and falls back to good old ASCII in the hope that it might be right, which is why the initial pasted character is a 7, that&#39;s 0x37 in ASCII.\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s your problem, the ToUnicode CMap does not contain a mapping to Unicode code points for all the character codes which are used in the PDF file. This is a fault of the PDF Creation tool, Mac OS/X 10.6 Quartz PDF Cn=ontext or (since the file has been modified) the editing application, &#39;Pages&#39;.\r\n\r\nHow can you fix this ? Well you could hand edit the ToUnicode CMap file and add entries for each character code. That would be a laborious process, because first you&#39;d have to identify each character code in the text and figure out what its Unicode code point is. Also, PDF is a binary format, with a cross-reference table. If you make any insertions in the file then the xref table will be invalid and the PDF file effectively corrupted. Some viewers will be able to fix it, some won&#39;t.\r\n\r\nAs I hinted above, a custom-encoded subset font is normally created so that the first character used in the document is given the character code 1, the second is 2 and so on. So for each document the actual mapping will be unique, its not going to be possible to write some code to reliably do this for you, because there is no &#39;one size fits all&#39; mapping.\r\n\r\nBasically you need to remake the PDF file using software which embeds a correct ToUnicode CMap in the PDF file.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204746/copy-pasting-hindi-from-a-correctly-rendering-pdf-pastes-only-certain-characters/58205617#58205617","title":"Copy-pasting Hindi from a correctly rendering PDF pastes only certain characters correctly"}],"owner":{"reputation":193,"user_id":9020922,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32b331cd8df3f5fc9c3a2e26fa13eaf3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jayce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9020922/jayce"},"last_editor":{"reputation":193,"user_id":9020922,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32b331cd8df3f5fc9c3a2e26fa13eaf3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jayce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9020922/jayce"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58205617,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570033758,"creation_date":1570030358,"last_edit_date":1570033049,"question_id":58204746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204746","body_markdown":"I have a PDF that renders correctly ([0]).

Since sklearn also does not have maximum norm, you could also rotate by 45 degrees and use a larger radius to get closer to what Generalized DBSCAN would give with above rules.

Spark does not know how to deal with ScalaPB enums (they are represented as sealed trait which is extended by case objects), and therefore it gives this error. The way around is to register the enums and a user-defined type. This can be done as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Add sparksql-scalapb-gen to your `project/plugins.sbt` **(not to your main `build.sbt`**):\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibraryDependencies += &quot;com.thesamet.scalapb&quot; %% &quot;sparksql-scalapb-gen&quot; % &quot;0.8.1&quot;\r\n```\r\n&gt; Check that the version above matches the version of `sparksql-scalapb` you are using.\r\n\r\n2.

If not, is there any other tool for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn this scenerio, assume that I have a single Git repository (A) that contains a large-file (`myFile.txt`) which is 10 GB and a binary code which uses `myFile.txt` during its run. I committed those files. Please note that I am not pushing it into Github.\r\n\r\n    $ cd A &amp;&amp; ls \r\n     run // Assume it is a build source code that do some operation with myFile.txt and gives an output\r\n

on the committed *version-2*. \r\n\r\nI can easily copy `myFile.txt` on *version-2* into different folder and run my code reading from its copied location but this will create a duplication most parts

Thanks to kwinkunks for the hint of using a pandas dataframe.\r\nI found a solution using this feature.\r\n\r\nThe binning is now done like this:\r\n\r\n    tempmin=np.min(temp[start:end])\r\n    tempmax=np.max(temp[start:end])\r\n    \r\n    binsize=1\r\n    bincenters=np.array(np.arange(np.round(tempmin),np.round(tempmax)+1,binsize))\r\n    lowerbinedges=np.array(bincenters-binsize/2)\r\n    higherbinedges=np.array(bincenters+binsize/2)\r\n    \r\n    allbinedges=np.append(lowerbinedges,higherbinedges[-1])\r\n    \r\n    temp_pd=pd.Series(temp[start:end])\r\n    traces=pd.Series(list(data[start:end,0:250]))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    tempbins=pd.cut(temp_pd,allbinedges,labels=bincenters)\r\n    \r\n    df=pd.concat([temp_pd,tempbins,traces], keys=[&#39;Temp&#39;,&#39;Bincenter&#39;,&#39;Traces&#39;], axis=1)\r\n\r\nby defining bins (in this case even-sized). The variable &quot;tempbins&quot; is of the same shape as temp (the &quot;raw&quot; temperature) and assignes every line of data to a certain bin.\r\n\r\nThe actual analysis is then extremely short. Starting with:\r\n\r\n    rf=pd.DataFrame({&#39;Bincenter&#39;: bincenters})\r\n    \r\n\r\nthe resultframe (&quot;rf&quot;) starts with the bincenters (as the x-axis in a plot later), and simply adds columns for the desired results. \r\n\r\nWith \r\n\r\n    df[df.Bincenter==xyz] \r\n\r\nI can select only those data lines from df, that I want to have in the selected bin.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my case, I am not interested in the actual time traces, but in the sum or the average, so I use lambda-functions, that run through the rows of rf and searches for every row in df, that has the same value in &quot;Bincenter&quot; there.\r\n\r\n    rf[&#39;Binsize&#39;]=rf.apply(lambda row: len(df.Traces[df.Bincenter==row.Bincenter]), axis=1)\r\n    rf[&#39;Trace_sum&#39;]=rf.apply(lambda row: sum(df.Traces[df.Bincenter==row.Bincenter]), axis=1)\r\n\r\nWith those, another column is added to the resultframe rf for the sum of the traces and the number of lines in the bin.\r\n\r\nI performed some fits of the traces in rf.Trace_sum, which I did not in pandas.\r\n\r\nStill, the dataframe was very useful here. I used odr for fitting like this\r\n\r\n    for i in binnumber:\r\n        fitdata=odr.Data(time[fitstart:],rf.Trace_sum.values[i][fitstart:])\r\n        ... some more fit stuff here...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand saved the fitresults in \r\n\r\n    lifetimefits=pd.DataFrame({&#39;lifetime&#39;: fitresult[:,1], &#39;sd_lifetime&#39;:fitresult[:,4]})\r\n\r\nand finally added them in the resultframe with\r\n\r\n    rf=pd.concat([rf,lifetimefits],axis=1)\r\n    rf[[&#39;Bincenter&#39;,&#39;Binsize&#39;,&#39;lifetime&#39;,&#39;sd_lifetime&#39;]].to_csv(&#39;results.csv&#39;, header=True, index=False)\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope, this explanation might help others to not waste time, trying this with numpy.

It is important to construct the future last, so that it is destroyed (and thus blocks) before all other members are destroyed. If this is too risky, use solution 3 instead.\r\n\r\n-----\r\nSolution 2, Use a detached thread like you did:\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n     void start() {\r\n        std::promise&lt;void&gt; p;\r\n        future = p.get_future();\r\n        std::thread(\r\n            [m = this-&gt;shared_from_this()](std::promise&lt;void&gt;&amp;&amp; p) {\r\n              m-&gt;method();\r\n              p.set_value();\r\n            },\r\n            std::move(p))\r\n            .detach();\r\n      }\r\n\r\nOne drawback of this solution: If you have many instances of `MyClass` you will create a lot of threads maybe resulting in contention. So a better option would be to use a thread pool instead of a single thread per object.\r\n\r\n----\r\nSolution 3, Separate the executable from the task class e.g:\r\n\r\n    class ExeClass {\r\n     public:\r\n      ~ExeClass() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Destructor of ExeClass&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; }\r\n      void method() {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;running&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n        do {\r\n          std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\r\n        } while (m_stop == false);\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;stopped&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n        return;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      std::atomic&lt;bool&gt; m_stop = false;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class MyClass {\r\n     public:\r\n      ~MyClass() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Destructor of MyClass&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; }\r\n    \r\n      void start() {\r\n        future = std::async(std::launch::async, &amp;ExeClass::method, exe);\r\n      }\r\n      void stop() { exe-&gt;m_stop = true; }\r\n    \r\n      std::shared_ptr&lt;ExeClass&gt; exe = std::make_shared&lt;ExeClass&gt;();\r\n      std::future&lt;void&gt; future;\r\n    };\r\n\r\nLike solution 1 this would block when the future is destroyed, however you don&#39;t need to take care of the order of construction and destruction. IMO this is the cleanest option.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204650/pending-stdfuture-get-of-stdasync-with-shared-from-this-argument-blocks-dest/58321530#58321530","title":"pending std::future get of std::async with shared_from_this argument blocks destruction of this"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12106769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c57f699e2169bc4af0d293ab05022ffe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WillB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106769/willb"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12106769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c57f699e2169bc4af0d293ab05022ffe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"WillB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106769/willb"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570707840,"creation_date":1570030050,"last_edit_date":1570696820,"question_id":58204650,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204650","body_markdown":"I wanted to create a class that would represent a task that can be started running asynchronously, and will run continuously (effectively in a detached thread) until a stop signal is received. The usage for the sake of this question would look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nauto task = std::make_shared&lt;Task&gt;();\r\ntask-&gt;start(); // starts the task running asynchronously\r\n... after some time passes ...\r\ntask-&gt;stop(); // signals to stop the task\r\ntask-&gt;future.get(); // waits for task to stop running and return its result\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, a key feature of this `Task` class is that I cannot guarantee that the future will be waited/getted ... i.e. the last line may not get called before the shared pointer is destroyed.\r\n\r\nA stripped-down toy version of the class I wrote is as follows (please ignore that everything is in public, this is just for this example&#39;s simplicity):\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nclass MyClass : public std::enable_shared_from_this&lt;MyClass&gt; {\r\npublic:\r\n    ~MyClass() { std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Destructor called&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl; }\r\n\r\n    void start() {\r\n        future = std::async(std::launch::async, &amp;MyClass::method, this-&gt;shared_from_this());\r\n    }\r\n    void stop() { m_stop = true; }\r\n\r\n    void method() {\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;running&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n        do {\r\n            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1));\r\n        } while(m_stop == false);\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;stopped&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n    std::future&lt;void&gt; future;\r\n    std::atomic&lt;bool&gt; m_stop = false;\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I discovered an undesirable feature of this code: if instead of `get` on the future I just `wait` (e.g. if I dont care about the result of `method`, which in this case is a void anyway), then when `task` is deleted, the instance doesnt get destroyed.\r\n\r\nI.e. doing `task-&gt;future.get()` gives:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunning\r\nstopped\r\nDestructor called\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `task-&gt;future.wait()` gives:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunning\r\nstopped\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom reading answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49505280/what-is-the-lifetime-of-the-arguments-of-stdasync I believe the problem here is the `this-&gt;shared_from_this()` argument to `std::async` wont be destroyed until the future from the async has been made invalid (through `get` or destruction or otherwise). So this shared_ptr is keeping the class instance alive.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n*Solution Attempt 1:*\r\n\r\nReplace the line in `start` with:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nfuture  = std::async(std::launch::async, [this]() {\r\n            return this-&gt;shared_from_this()-&gt;method();\r\n        });\r\n```\r\nThis ensures shared_ptr it creates is destroyed when the method completes, but I have been worried that there&#39;s nothing to stop `this` being destroyed between the time of it being captured by the lambda capture (which happens at this line, correct?) and the time the lambda is executed in the new thread. Is this a real possibility?\r\n\r\n---\r\n*Solution Attempt 2:*\r\n\r\nTo protect the `this` (`task`) being destroyed before the lambda function runs, I add another member variable `std::shared_ptr&lt;MyClass&gt; myself` then my start method can look like this:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nmyself = this-&gt;shared_from_this();\r\nfuture  = std::async(std::launch::async, [this]() {\r\n            auto my_ptr = std::move(this-&gt;myself);\r\n            return myself-&gt;method();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the idea is that `myself` will ensure that if I delete the `task` shared_ptr, I dont destroy the class. Then inside the lambda, the shared_ptr is transferred to the local `my_ptr` variable, which is destroyed on exit.\r\n\r\n----\r\nAre there issues with this solution, or have I overlooked a much cleaner way of achieving the sort functionality I&#39;m after?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204650/pending-stdfuture-get-of-stdasync-with-shared-from-this-argument-blocks-dest","title":"pending std::future get of std::async with shared_from_this argument blocks destruction of this"},{"tags":["build","rust","rust-cargo"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":184439,"user_id":155423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/419218774d04a581476ea1887a0921e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shepmaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/155423/shepmaster"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570030623,"post_id":58204649,"comment_id":102787799,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204649/how-to-change-build-rs-behavior-based-on-the-current-cargo-command#comment102787799_58204649"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11957368,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/337aa89761ed3a515ffe17f0da02c119?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mr_broccoli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11957368/mr-broccoli"},"last_editor":{"reputation":184439,"user_id":155423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/419218774d04a581476ea1887a0921e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shepmaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/155423/shepmaster"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1570062352,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570030596,"creation_date":1570030050,"last_edit_date":1570030596,"question_id":58204649,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204649","body_markdown":"My build.rs is complicated since I am using it to generate tests and run some other binaries before actually compiling my current project.
