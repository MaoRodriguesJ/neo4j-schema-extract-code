You can then use this variable to set the values for the class you&#39;re creating.\r\n\r\nSo, given this class:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass User\r\n{\r\n    public string Name { get; set; }\r\n    public string Surname { get; set; }   \r\n}\r\n```\r\nYou could write code like:\r\n\r\n    Console.Write(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;);\r\n    string name = Console.ReadLine();\r\n\r\n    Console.Write(&quot;Enter your Surname: &quot;);\r\n    string surname = Console.ReadLine();\r\n\r\n    User user1 = new User() { Name = name, Surname = surname };\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, {0} {1}.&quot;, user1.Name, user1.Surname);\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow, looking at that code above, it seems a little repetitive. We can wrap both the `Console.Write` and `Console.ReadLine` calls into a single method that takes in a `string` that represents the prompt for the user, and which returns a `string`, which is the user&#39;s input:\r\n\r\n    private static string GetUserInput(string prompt)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.Write(prompt);\r\n        return Console.ReadLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd now we can cut the lines of code needed to get user input from 4 to 2:\r\n\r\n    string name = GetUserInput(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;);\r\n    string surname = GetUserInput(&quot;Enter your surname: &quot;);\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnd, in fact, we can get really crazy and reduce the code to instantiate a new `User` class to one line, where we call our method and use it&#39;s return value when creating the object:\r\n\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        User user1 = new User \r\n        {\r\n            Name = GetUserInput(&quot;Enter your name: &quot;),\r\n            Surname = GetUserInput(&quot;Enter your surname: &quot;)\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, {0} {1}.&quot;, user1.Name, user1.Surname);\r\n        Console.ReadKey();\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124905/how-to-create-an-instance-of-class-and-its-properties-with-user-input-in-c/58125467#58125467","title":"how to create an instance of class and its properties with user input in c#"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12008684,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDao-HrFrAVB_osoUtyxAXzNchCmjFqwnv9Y2VqbQ=k-s128","display_name":"ruralindian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12008684/ruralindian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569573606,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569537725,"creation_date":1569532750,"last_edit_date":1569533050,"question_id":58124905,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124905","body_markdown":"I have a class...\r\n\r\n    Class Logins\r\n    {\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n        public string Surname { get; set; }   \r\n    }\r\n\r\nand my main function is \r\n\r\n\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        Logins User1 = new Logins() { Name = &quot;mark&quot;, Contact = &quot;134&quot; };\r\n    \r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} {1} &quot;, User1.Name,User1.Contact);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n Right now i am hard coding the instances of this class and also assigning it the properties at the same time.

Numerous tutorials online don&#39;t go into enough detail with the concepts of rendering and canvas.ctx (context). \r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m trying to do is something very simple: **Render an image on a canvas element and, on keydown, update its position and render it at the new location, making it move across the screen.** Basically, what every video game does with its sprites.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been told through these tutorials that ```ctx.drawImage(image, x, y, ...)``` will work for this. However, what ends up happening in my version is essentially what happens when you win a game of solitaire on windows. **It repeats the sprite&#39;s image as if it&#39;s creating a brand new sprite each time the game loops.** The sprite itself doesn&#39;t move, a new sprite seems to be generated to the left/right/etc of the original one. I understand that I&#39;m calling ```ctx.drawImage(...)``` every time I&#39;m iterating through the game loop. However, this didn&#39;t happen when I used ```ctx.clearRect(...)```. It worked precisely how I expected it to. I&#39;m not exactly sure why creating a rectangle with ctx works while creating an image doesn&#39;t. \r\n\r\nMy question is: **Is there a way to simply update the position of the sprite without creating a brand new version of it every single loop?** \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my relevant code:\r\n```\r\nlet lastRender = 0; // For the general loop\r\n\r\nlet image = new Image();\r\nimage.src = &quot;/img/image.png&quot;;\r\n\r\nlet state = {\r\n    pressedKeys: {\r\n        // left, right, up, down: false\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    position: {\r\n        x: canvas.width / 2,\r\n        y: canvas.width / 2\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    speed: 20\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet pepsi = new Sprite({\r\n    img: image,\r\n    width: 100,\r\n    height: 100\r\n)};\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction Sprite (options) {\r\n    this.img = options.img;\r\n    this.width = options.width;\r\n    this.height = options.height;\r\n\r\n    this.render = function(){\r\n        ctx.drawImage(\r\n        this.img,\r\n        state.position.x,\r\n        state.position.y\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction updatePosition(progress) {\r\n        //pressedKeys is just an object that relates WASD to the key codes \r\n        //     and their respective directions, it&#39;s ignorable\r\n\r\n        if (state.pressedKeys.left) {\r\n            state.position.x -= state.speed;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (state.pressedKeys.right) {\r\n            state.position.x += state.speed;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (state.pressedKeys.up) {\r\n            state.position.y -= state.speed;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if (state.pressedKeys.down) {\r\n            state.position.y += state.speed;\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction draw() {\r\n    pepsi.render();\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction loop(timestamp) {\r\n    let progress = timestamp - lastRender;\r\n\r\n    update(progress) // &lt;-- Updates position, doesn&#39;t touch draw()\r\n\r\n    draw(); // &lt;-- Runs pepsi.render(); each loop\r\n\r\n    lastRender = timestamp;             \r\n    window.requestAnimationFrame(loop); \r\n}\r\n\r\nwindow.requestAnimationFrame(loop); // for the general loop \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have any qualms with the way this project is set up (for example, using the state.position for *each* Sprite), then I&#39;d be glad to hear them in addition to the solution to my problem.

fixed this by setting nat=yes in the sip.conf on Asterisk server under the configuration for the OpenSIPs server.\r\n\r\nI noticed that when I tested on a newer version of Asterisk I got better errors in the Asterisk console. I noticed Asterisk was trying to send the RTP to the private LAN IP of the endpoint (my sip phone) instead of the public IP of my internet connection where the phone is located. Not sure why it was trying to do that. I am wondering if OpenSIPs needs to be modified. Was puzzles me is that I have NEVER had to set nat=yes on Asterisk when sending calls to servers with static public IP. In this case I am sending calls to an extension like 456@xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx where xxx is the public static IP of my OpenSIPs server so, no NAT involved there. The NAT comes into play when the call is sent to the endpoint which is behind a NAT. Makes no sense to me why I should have to set nat=yes to make this work but, this was an immediate fix. Will research more later, might need a change on the OpenSIPs side instead of nat=yes on the Asterisk side.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124882/1-way-audio-only-when-registering-to-opensips-in-front-of-asterisk/58125531#58125531","title":"1 way audio only when registering to OpenSIPs in front of Asterisk"}],"owner":{"reputation":1112,"user_id":1190287,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jFVRP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Todd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1190287/todd"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569537203,"creation_date":1569532495,"question_id":58124882,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124882","body_markdown":"Long time Asterisk user but fairly new to OpenSIPs.

Runs a loop to open Excel files in a folder, one by one\r\n2. Every time that an Excel file is opened, a password unprotects the worksheet and unmerges cells\r\n3. Once the cells are unmerged, the data from the Excel file is copied and pasted to specific cells in the workbook where the VBA code is originally saved/stored\r\n4. Upon pasting the data, the opened Excel workbook from the loop now closes (not necessary to save), and the next workbook is opened, where the next set of data is placed one row below the previous row\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe VBA code is run from a workbook which always remains open, we can call it &quot;Workbook 1.xlsm&quot;  In this instance for the code below, the use of wbPaste as the active workbook is intended to reference &quot;Workbook 1.xlsm&quot;.  Because the name of the workbook is going to change every month that this is run, I wanted to declare a workbook by using a naming convention that would reference the name, regardless of what the workbook is called.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe files that are in the folder can have various names, and could be in the hundreds of total files.  I have declared most of the variables and have had success in getting the Excel workbooks to open from the folder. Unprotecting the sheet, and unmerging the cells has given some problems, however.  I think that the issue that I am experiencing comes with looping the opening of the workbooks and which workbook is considered &quot;active&quot; at the time.\r\n\r\n        Sub OpenFilesForExtraction()\r\n\r\n        \r\n        &#39;declaration of variables\r\n        Dim myFolder As String\r\n        Dim myFile As String\r\n        Dim wbCopy As Workbook\r\n        Dim wbPaste As Workbook\r\n        Dim lastRow As Long\r\n\r\n\r\n        &#39;setting up name of folder and file type (any Excel file in folder) for the loop\r\n        myFolder = &quot;C:\\Users\\Me\\Desktop\\Folder 1\\&quot;\r\n        myFile = Dir(myFolder &amp; &quot;*.xl??&quot;)\r\n        lastRow = 3\r\n\r\n        &#39;start of loop\r\n        Do While myFile &lt;&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n        Workbooks.Open fileName:=myFolder &amp; myFile\r\n    \r\n\r\n        &#39;wbCopy is the Excel file that gets unprotected, unmerged and data is copied from. wbPaste will be where the data gets copied to.  wbPaste is referencing the workbook where the macro is stored.

I think that there are two potential reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst, I am not certain if I should use anything related to ActiveWorkbook.  The reason why is because as I loop through opening the Excel documents in the folder, the VBA code may not understand which is meant to be the ActiveWorkbook at certain times.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Unmerging and copy/paste of values is where this will stop the program.  I have had some chances to allow the cells to unmerge, but I think it came at the cost of calling out the wbCopy file as an ActiveWorkbook, when it really isn&#39;t meant to be called out as an active workbook.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124867/am-i-setting-up-the-loop-correctly-to-get-data-from-several-workbooks-into-one","title":"Am I setting up the loop correctly to get data from several workbooks into one?"},{"tags":["javascript","cookies","google-chrome-extension","async-await"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127474,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c618235f2ea6bc9275d47b89a8007d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mikolaj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127474/mikolaj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569532953,"creation_date":1569532953,"answer_id":58124938,"question_id":58124864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124938","body_markdown":"````\r\n// assuming chrome.cookies.get\r\nfunction checkCookie(url, name) {\r\n  return chrome.cookies.get({url, name}, cookie =&gt; cookie);\r\n}\r\nvar cookie = checkCookie(url, name)\r\n\r\n````\r\nI&#39;m not very familiar with the chrome.cookies.get, and so have no idea how to test this, but any rational function employing callbacks would return the value of the callback.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could wrap it in a promise","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124864/chrome-extension-cookie-await-a-callback-function/58124938#58124938","title":"Chrome Extension / cookie / await a callback function"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569541009,"creation_date":1569541009,"answer_id":58125976,"question_id":58124864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125976","body_markdown":"Most of Chrome API didn&#39;t return a promise when we call them, we have to provide it a callback to handle the response.

From your question it seems that you need to implement point-to-point model. So, basically, some `customer` service will publish `order` to the queue and single `performer` will receive and process it. This way dispatching `orders` between `performers` is handled automatically by messaging system.\r\n\r\nRegarding concrete messaging system - you can use either Kafka or RabbitMQ, or any other messaging broker, since most of them supports point-to-point nowadays.\r\n\r\nFor example, [with Kafka you can achieve point-to-point](https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CompetingConsumers.html) by having `orders` Kafka-topic, and putting all `performers` in single consumer group. This way when `order` comes, it will be load-balanced by Kafka among `performers` in the same consumer group, so only one `performer` will receive and process it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124849/how-to-distributed-order-between-all-participants/58125272#58125272","title":"How to distributed order between all participants?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2382,"user_id":1664318,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1L0iT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maxim Fateev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1664318/maxim-fateev"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569553839,"creation_date":1569553839,"answer_id":58127301,"question_id":58124849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58127301","body_markdown":"I would recommend looking at [Cadence Workflow][1].

All I&#39;m trying to do is print out the vector that would ideally be produced by subsetting the DF. The issue I am having is I use the same `desired_column_name` elsewhere referencing the data frame directly and as such, I cannot just &quot;add quotations&quot; to my argument. I attempted adding quotations to the `desired_column_name` argument and then applying `noquote` from within the function but that didn&#39;t work either and made things worse.  \r\n\r\nHere are the simple inputs I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\n```\r\nS = c(1,0,0,4,1,6,6,3,5,3,1)\r\npopulation = data.frame(S)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code for reference:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproportion_of_elements= function(df_for_use, desired_column_name, desired_elements,logical){     \r\n  \r\n  DF = df_for_use\r\n\r\n  chr_desired_column_name = as.character(desired_column_name)\r\n  \r\n  desired_column =  DF[,chr_desired_column_name]\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  vec_length = length(desired_column)\r\n  num_of_desired_element = sum(desired_column == desired_elements)\r\n  proportion = num_of_desired_element/vec_length\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  statement_for_pop_prop = c(&quot;The proportion of &quot;, desired_elements,&#39;\\&#39;s&#39;, &quot;from the population is: &quot;, proportion)\r\n  format_vers_of_statement_for_pop_prop = str_c(statement_for_pop_prop, collapse = &quot; &quot;)\r\n  \r\n  # summary = summarize(data_frame, mean = mean(desired_column_name, na.rm = TRUE), var = var(desired_column_name, na.rm = TRUE), sd = sd(desired_column_name, na.rm = TRUE))\r\n  # \r\n  # statement_of_summary = c(&quot;The summary statistics are the following: &quot;, summary)\r\n  # \r\n  # format_of_summary = str_c(statement_of_summary, collapse = &quot; &quot;)\r\n  \r\n  #print(format_vers_of_statement_for_pop_prop)\r\n   print(desired_column)\r\n  \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nReproducible Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nproportion_of_elements(population,S,1,FALSE)\r\n```\r\nDesired output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1 0 0 4 1 6 6 3 5 3 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent Output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n Error in `[.data.frame`(DF, , chr_desired_column_name) : \r\n  undefined columns selected \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, I can get the desired output, but that would require me putting quotations around the `desired_column_name` argument which would result in everything else breaking.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I also attempted another suggested solution of redefining the data frame itself within the function. I tried this using `DF`. The commented out code is the part that uses `desired_column_name` without quotation marks. \r\n\r\nIf my code is too convulated, I apologize. The main issue I&#39;m seeing has to do with how `desired_column` is being interpreted. So that is the part to focus on.\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody that provides any suggestions.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nAfter the suggestion given by G. Grothendieck, I edited my code and got the following error:\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124848/subsetting-a-data-from-within-a-function-in-r","title":"Subsetting a data from within a function in R"},{"tags":["reactjs","express","amazon-ec2","react-router","production"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17810,"user_id":5059657,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V0P2SXS07Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC5k/cTht2gcsEbk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexander Staroselsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5059657/alexander-staroselsky"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569533063,"post_id":58124847,"comment_id":102638250,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124847/refreshing-react-with-express-server#comment102638250_58124847"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9285447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a9f1707fa0bf787021230ca0d2eeb58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9285447/m-doe"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17810,"user_id":5059657,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V0P2SXS07Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC5k/cTht2gcsEbk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexander Staroselsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5059657/alexander-staroselsky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569543060,"post_id":58124847,"comment_id":102640287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124847/refreshing-react-with-express-server#comment102640287_58124847"},{"owner":{"reputation":17810,"user_id":5059657,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0V0P2SXS07Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAC5k/cTht2gcsEbk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexander Staroselsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5059657/alexander-staroselsky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569543648,"post_id":58124847,"comment_id":102640378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124847/refreshing-react-with-express-server#comment102640378_58124847"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9285447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a9f1707fa0bf787021230ca0d2eeb58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.Doe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9285447/m-doe"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569532312,"creation_date":1569532312,"question_id":58124847,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124847","body_markdown":"I have looked through the questions and can&#39;t seem to find the answer.

I have search and can&#39;t find my answer.\r\n\r\nMy React Router looks like:\r\n\r\n          render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            &lt;Router&gt;\r\n              &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n                  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={Homepage} /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/firstPage&quot; component={FirstPage} /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/secondPage&quot; component={SecondPage} /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/thirdPage&quot; component={ThirdPage} /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;Route path=&#39;/*&#39; exact={true} component={Page404} /&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;  \r\n            &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n         \r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy server looks like: \r\n\r\n    \r\n    const express = require(&quot;express&quot;);\r\n    const cors = require(&#39;cors&#39;);\r\n    const bodyParser = require(&#39;body-parser&#39;);\r\n    const nodemailer = require(&#39;nodemailer&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const config = require(&#39;./config.js&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    const app = express();\r\n    \r\n    app.use(cors());\r\n    app.use(express.json());\r\n    \r\n    app.use((req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        res.header(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&quot;, &quot;*&quot;);\r\n        res.header(&quot;Access-Control-Allow-Headers&quot;, &quot;Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept&quot;);\r\n        next();\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    //Here is my attempt to get the page to refresh\r\n    app.get(&#39;*&#39;, (req, res) =&gt;{\r\n        res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname + &#39;/public/index.html&#39;));\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    app.listen(port, () =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(`Server Running on Port: ${port}`);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nI know there is a hashrouter and I would like to avoid using it. I know there is browserrouter as well. I have tried but I still get the 404 error. \r\n\r\nI want to be able to go to https://amazingdomain/firstpage hit f5 and go right back to that same page in production. Any help would be appreciated! \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124847/refreshing-react-with-express-server","title":"Refreshing React with Express server"},{"tags":["regex"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4804,"user_id":3982562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002175002230/picture?type=large","display_name":"3limin4t0r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3982562/3limin4t0r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569532530,"post_id":58124840,"comment_id":102638095,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124840/how-exactly-lazy-regex-works#comment102638095_58124840"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5c4b91d1c2c92036f3166c883deb8bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Flavio Do","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127447/flavio-do"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127447,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5c4b91d1c2c92036f3166c883deb8bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Flavio Do","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127447/flavio-do"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569532356,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569532410,"creation_date":1569532261,"last_edit_date":1569532410,"question_id":58124840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124840","body_markdown":"I created this regex:\r\n\r\n    [?&lt;=&quot;ente&quot;;)(.*)(?=&quot;;)\r\n\r\nSo basically I&#39;m able to select everything between `&quot;ente&quot;;` and `&quot;;`, but I was thinking, how can I turn this Regex into a Lazy regex in order to pick only the first occurrence of `&quot;;`?\r\n\r\nI tried some like like `-u` but without any success.\r\n\r\n\r\nInput:\r\n\r\n    a:2:{s:4:&quot;ente&quot;;s:6:&quot;Ante A&quot;;s:8:&quot;minisito&quot;;s:4:&quot;test&quot;;}\r\n\r\nCurrent: \r\n\r\n    s:6:&quot;Ante A&quot;;s:8:&quot;minisito&quot;;s:4:&quot;test&quot;\r\n\r\nDesiderable:\r\n\r\n    s:6:&quot;Ante A&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124840/how-exactly-lazy-regex-works","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"how exactly Lazy Regex works?"},{"tags":["php","xml","mysqli"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57829,"user_id":9473764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1a6d80ec4ac5549a392ae88fb0ed688?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9473764/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569533184,"post_id":58124837,"comment_id":102638283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124837/store-xml-from-web-response-to-mysql-using-php#comment102638283_58124837"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":8008238,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb9796f9cc75654d668ba96f2aa7b622?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maevari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8008238/maevari"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33,"user_id":8008238,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb9796f9cc75654d668ba96f2aa7b622?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maevari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8008238/maevari"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569538101,"creation_date":1569532241,"last_edit_date":1569538101,"question_id":58124837,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124837","body_markdown":"I am trying to complete a seemingly simple project which somehow defeated me (most likely to my minimal knowledge in this matter).

The source of problem are spaces after commas:\r\nThey become the initial part of the next column name.\r\n\r\nSo even if you had just 3 columns of data, the column names would be:\r\n\r\n    [&#39;Data 1&#39;, &#39; Data 2&#39;, &#39; Data 3&#39;]\r\n\r\n(note the leading spaces).

My analysis software Metamorph acquires all the information from 384-well plates and quantifies it into an excel workbook. By trying to create a 16x24 grid on Tkinter, I want to map the analysis values of each well in excel to its particular position on the 16x24 grid. I want the user to be able to click on a cell in the 16x24 tkinter grid and have it appear to be a color. But everytime I click the button again, it changes colors. Whatever color the cells determine which group they belong to. For example, if I click through a row of cells that all recieved 5uM drug, originally they would all appear blank but then they would all appear &quot;blue&quot; for instance, and then all blue cells would be averaged. If I click on the cell twice, it goes first from white to blue, then blue to green, and then all the green cells would become averaged. \r\n\r\nI have gotten up to the part where I begin coding some sort of &quot;toggle-switch&quot;, that I&#39;d like to go between colors but I&#39;m having a hard time figuring out how to implement it. I found this code from some stackoverflow post before that shapes into almost what I want.

Some people would suggest to use database migration, but here are two reasons I can&#39;t do it.\r\n\r\n    1. Zero Downtime for the web service A, so I can&#39;t do any migration on postgres on service A.\r\n    2. postgres database have tens of Gigabytes data, migration process might eat up my CPU or block the database, which I don&#39;t want to risk it.\r\n\r\nI am thinking to use knex on service B(node.js) to fetch a postgres database on Service A, it is more like a simple ETL, the code below can work well as a example.\r\n\r\n    var knex1 = knex({\r\n        client:&#39;pg&#39;,\r\n        connection:{\r\n          database: co.database,\r\n          host: co.host,\r\n          user: co.user,\r\n          password: co.password,\r\n          port:co.port\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n    var sqlQuery = &#39;select * from abc&#39;;\r\n    var data = await knex1.select().from(knex1.raw(&#39;(&#39; + sqlQuery + &#39;) Wstmain&#39;));\r\n\r\nAlthough fetching data from postgres(service A) is fine, my problem is prior to inserting the data to postgres(service B), postgres database(service B) needs firstly know to the table schema and build up the table.\r\n\r\nso right now I don&#39;t know how to use to get and export table schema on database A, then use the schema to create table on database B. I find a module called &#39;widget-knex-schema&#39;.\r\n\r\n    const migrate =  require(&#39;widget-knex-schema&#39;);\r\n    const knex =  require(&#39;knex&#39;)({config...});\r\n     \r\n    const usersSchema =  {\r\n      id: {type: &#39;increments&#39;, nullable: false, primary: true},\r\n      name: {type: &#39;string&#39;, maxlength: 200, nullable: false},\r\n      email: {type: &#39;string&#39;, maxlength: 254, nullable: false, unique: true},\r\n      password: {type: &#39;string&#39;, maxlength: 254, nullable: false}\r\n    };\r\n     \r\n    migrate.createTable(knex, &#39;users&#39;, usersSchema, true)\r\n    .then(function () {\r\n      // success\r\n    })\r\n\r\nIt can create a new table with a json based schema, but how would I use knex to export such a json

The &#39;main&#39; class is very cluttered with these try/catch blocks and obscures what the code is doing. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m not working with Spring but using JaxRs to handle exceptions. This would be the ReST entry to the service or controller, but we&#39;re also doing our doa processes here (I know, but just how it is). So we need to return a ResponseEntity with the required info.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic restVerifyName(userId) {\r\n    String name;\r\n    try {\r\n        string name = nameProvider.getName(userId)\r\n    } catch (exception A) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage, status);\r\n    } catch (exception B) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage, status);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (name == null) {\r\n      return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage, status);\r\n     }\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        nameAuthenticator.verifyName(name)\r\n    } catch (Exception B) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage, status);\r\n    }\r\n    Return Response.Ok().entity(name);\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage, status) {\r\n    ErrorResponse errorResponse = errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage)\r\n    return new Response.status(status).entity(errorResponse);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I want to pull these try/catches into private methods and have it all be a bit more self documenting. My replacement is roughly:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic restVerifyName() {\r\n    String name = getName();\r\n    if (!nameIsVerfied(name)  {\r\n         return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage);\r\n    }\r\n    Return Response.Ok().entity(name);\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate String getName() {\r\n    String name;\r\n    try {\r\n        name = nameProvider.getName()\r\n    } catch (exception A) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage);\r\n    } catch (exception B) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilderConflict(errorCode, errorMessage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (name == null) {\r\n     return new errorResponseBuilderConflict(errorCode, errorMessage);\r\n    }\r\n    return name;\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate boolean verifyName(name) {\r\n    try {\r\n        return nameAuthenticator.verifyName(name)\r\n    } catch (Exception B) {\r\n        return new errorResponseBuilderBadRequest(errorCode, errorMessage);\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nprivate errorResponseBuilderBadRequest(errorCode, errorMessage) {\r\n    ErrorResponse errorResponse = errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage)\r\n    ResponseEntity response = Response.status(status).entity(errorResponse)\r\n    throw new BadRequestException(response)\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate errorResponseBuilderConflict(errorCode, errorMessage) {\r\n    ErrorResponse errorResponse = errorResponseBuilder(errorCode, errorMessage)\r\n    ResponseEntity response = Response.status(status).entity(errorResponse)\r\n    throw new ConfictException(response)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe response returned is the exact same in both stations. \r\n\r\nRegardless of any logic errors/formatting etc. Which general approach is best practice? Throwing exceptions with responses, or returning responses (in context of this examples refactor goal)\r\n\r\nThis is on a larger scale with a few more try/catches, so I feel removing clutter from the &#39;main&#39; class is more readable. Is throwing exceptions with responseEntities and letting JaxRs handle it frowned upon? \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124779/throw-badrequestexceptionresponseentity-vs-catch-error-return-responseentity","title":"Throw BadRequestException(ResponseEntity) vs Catch Error, return ResponseEntity(HTTPStatus.BadRequest) ReST API"},{"tags":["ios","memory","jailbreak","mach"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCnKRWIsT1GLZ8wDB21FxFXzdWqhlfeIidLHB3e=k-s128","display_name":"Francis Demencis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127140/francis-demencis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12127140,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCnKRWIsT1GLZ8wDB21FxFXzdWqhlfeIidLHB3e=k-s128","display_name":"Francis Demencis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127140/francis-demencis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569586179,"creation_date":1569531892,"last_edit_date":1569586179,"question_id":58124769,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124769","body_markdown":"I started to work with the Mach API on my jailbroken iPhone X couple days ago.

I&#39;ve never used Javascript before!\r\n\r\n    // ==UserScript==\r\n    // @name        *Page Refresher\r\n    // @include     *\r\n    // ==/UserScript==\r\n    // @grant    GM.getValue\r\n    // @grant    GM.setValue\r\n    \r\n    var refreshRate = 10000; //Refreshes every 10s\r\n    var newCount =document.images.length; //Counts images on page\r\n       \r\n    if (GM.getValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;,-1) === -1){\r\n      GM.setValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;,newCount);\r\n      window.setTimeout(function(){window.location.reload() ;},refreshRate);\r\n    } else {\r\n      if (newCount &lt;= GM.getValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;)){\r\n          GM.setValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;,newCount);\r\n          window.setTimeout(function(){window.location.reload() ;},refreshRate);\r\n    } else {\r\n         if (newCount &gt; GM.getValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;)){\r\n             GM.setValue(&#39;oldCount&#39;,newCount);\r\n             alert(&#39;More images!&#39;);\r\n          }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the rough code I&#39;m working with. I&#39;m just not really sure where I&#39;m going wrong - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s something pretty straightforward, but I&#39;m definitely struggling.

is not possible with `compile_error!`. The macro is evaluated way before things like code optimization are happening. There are basically only two contexts in which `compile_error!` is useful right now: \r\n\r\n- Conditional compilation with `#[cfg(...)]`\r\n- Macros generating code that may contain a `compile_error!`\r\n\r\nBoth of these are evaluated before the `compile_error!` error is emitted.\r\n\r\nThere is no nice functionality to let you do what you want to achieve. However, there exists a kind of *hack*. It is used by [the `no-panic` crate](https://github.com/dtolnay/no-panic) and causes an error at link time (something you usually see pretty rarely in Rust). \r\n\r\nThe trick works by inserting a reference to an unknown symbol at each panic location. If the optimizer (which runs very late in the compilation pipeline, but still mainly before linking) can remove the branch leading to the `panic`, it also removes the reference to the unknown symbol. If the optimizer cannot remove the branch, then the final code contains a reference to that unknown symbol and the linker will produce an &quot;undefined reference to ...&quot; error. It&#39;s not a nice error, but it stops the program from compiling.\r\n\r\nYour goal is a bit more elaborate though: you only want an error if the compiler is sure that a panic will absolutely happen. That&#39;s more tricky, but you might be able to use this hack to solve it, too.

I&#39;m sure this is not the best approach, but better than nothing:\r\n\r\n1. Find or create a `list` like `PriorityQueue` with `size` and `comparator` constructor args. Size should be known (according to your requirement)\r\n * Method `add(..)` should match `O(log n)` and sort items while inserting them\r\n * Method `add(..)` should return `false` when list fully filled (otherwise `true`)\r\n2. Perform the stream reading and &lt;s&gt;immediately (without buffering)&lt;/s&gt; add integers to your collection. Create a new list if no free space.\r\n3. Now you have a collection of sorted lists. The last step is to sort data through lists:\r\n  `[1,4,5],[3,8,9],[2,6,7]` --&gt; `[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]`\r\nFor example, by picking minimums from list#1 and list#2, comparing them, so on. . .\r\n\r\nNOTE: Also you can perform Step#3 in concurrent\r\n\r\nAbout #2:\r\nI missed that you have string-data. So parsing byte sequence to integers is bad idea. However, it should be possible to parse data char-by-char and then convert to int when a comma appears.

goal:** \r\n\r\n - Run jquery script to click &quot;add to cart&quot; button from a &#39;specific&#39; third party website product page. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Expected Result:**\r\n\r\nRunning the script via **evaluateJavaScript** from WKWebView should allow me to click on the checkout button and add the product to cart. \r\n\r\n**Actual Result:**\r\n\r\nRunning my script via **evaluateJavascript** gives me a javascript exception(provided below): \r\n\r\n```\r\nError Domain=WKErrorDomain Code=4 &quot;A JavaScript exception occurred&quot; UserInfo={\r\n\tWKJavaScriptExceptionLineNumber=0, \r\n\tWKJavaScriptExceptionMessage=, \r\n\tWKJavaScriptExceptionColumnNumber=0, \r\n\tNSLocalizedDescription=A JavaScript exception occurred\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnlike similar questions related to getting a javascript exception from evaluateJavaScript, my exception was returning a much rather broad exception. &quot;WKJavaScriptExceptionMessage&quot; is usually very descriptive but there was nothing of value that I can take from it to fix my javascript issue. \r\n\r\nWhen testing, script runs fine on the console of google chrome and safari inspector(for mobile). It was able to perform the expected results with no issue. So I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m getting an exception in the first place when running the script from **evaluateJavascript**.\r\n\r\n**If you are curious, this is my code from initializing/viewDidLoad:** \r\n\r\n```\r\nlet config = WKWebViewConfiguration()\r\nlet contentController = WKUserContentController()\r\n\r\nconfig.processPool = CurrentProcessPool.shared.getCurrentProcessPool()\r\nconfig.websiteDataStore = WKWebsiteDataStore.default()\r\nconfig.userContentController = contentController\r\n\r\nlet webViewModel = WKWebView(frame: window.bounds, configuration: config)\r\nlet productPageLink = &quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=7yE5K5lr0eU&amp;offerid=639733.3977&amp;type=15&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rebeccaminkoff.com%2F%2F%2Fproducts%2Fsandra-puffer-f19100911-khaki&quot;\r\nlet url = myURL(string: productPageLink) \r\n\r\nDispatchQueue.main.async {\r\n\twebViewModel.load(URLRequest(url: url))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This is where I load the script:** \r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {\r\n\tDispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 5.0) {\r\n\t\tlet size = &quot;XXS&quot;\r\n\t\tlet myScript = &quot;&quot;&quot; \r\n\r\n\t\tdocument.querySelector(&#39;.size-select [data-size-option = &quot;\\(size)&quot; i]&#39;).click()\r\n\t\tdocument.querySelector(&#39;.add-to-cart&#39;).click()\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\t&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n\t\twebView.evaluateJavaScript(myScript, completionHandler: { (result, error) in\r\n\t\t\tprint(result)\r\n\t\tprint(error)\r\n\t})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n    \r\n\r\nLet me know if there are areas that need clarification and I would happily fill in that information. \r\n\r\n**myScript printed content:** \r\n\r\n         window.onerror = function(){\r\n            return true;\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            document.querySelector(&#39;.size-select [data-size-option = &quot;XXS&quot;

It is an event-driven flow. \r\n\r\nIn your case assignment to &#39;c&#39; happens when any input to the *assign* statement change.\r\nBut the change will be detected only when execution of the non-timed chunk in your initial block is done. And this chunk ended with the last statement. \r\n\r\nSo, as a result, all your $display(c) will show the value of &#39;c&#39; as it existed before the initial block starts execution. In order to see updates, you need let the code wait till the changes have a chance to propagate. A simple example would be the following:\r\n\r\n    initial begin\r\n      d = 0;\r\n      a = 1;\r\n      b = 1;\r\n      #1 $display(c);\r\n      a = 2;\r\n      b = 1;\r\n      #1 $display(c);\r\n      a = 2;\r\n      b = 2;\r\n      #1 $display(c);\r\n      a = 2;\r\n      b = 3;\r\n      d = 3;\r\n      #1 $display(c);\r\n    end\r\n\r\n Adding #1 before every $display will let the changes to propagate and display expected results.\r\n\r\nThere is a gray area in interpretation of the code like yours. Note that the initial block has a, b, and d as the output. In the sequential code with no timing control constructs it just re-assigns the values of those outputs. For simulation semantics only the lastly assigned values matter and should trigger an event.  However, it looks like some simulators might interpret it differently and trigger events whenever the value changes. This is up to the simulator implementation in this case. For example, as i noticed, VCS does trigger events for every change, but only in some cases. NC does not trigger those events. \r\n\r\nI guess you can interpret the simulation behavior as `undefined` for this kinds of the code. To make it deterministic, use correct timing controls, as in the example above.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124713/verilog-addition-unexpectedly-results-in-x/58124987#58124987","title":"Verilog addition unexpectedly results in x"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23542,"user_id":2755607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0b903bf594599a27ed5df3776e42c5b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dave_59","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2755607/dave-59"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569550211,"creation_date":1569550211,"answer_id":58126846,"question_id":58124713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58126846","body_markdown":"Both outputs are valid, you have a race condition.\r\n\r\nA continuous `assign` statement is a concurrent process that waits for signals on the RHS to change, then evaluates the expression and makes the assignment.\r\n\r\nThe `initial` block is another concurrent process.

I am trying to find the velocity from t = 0 to t = 1 seconds with three different step sizes of delta_t = 0.05, 0.1, and 0.2 seconds. And then you are supposed to show your percent error to the analytical solution given as: **V(t) = sqrt((m*g)/C_d) * tanh(sqrt((g*C_d)/m) * t).** \r\nMy problem is I am not sure how to iterate through Euler&#39;s method multiple times with different time intervals.

That&#39;s the way to do literally what you&#39;re saying. But if you&#39;re down this road, you&#39;ve usually mis-designed your protocols. For example, while I know this is fabricated, it&#39;s a great example of a mis-designed protocol. The Animal protocol should almost certainly be:\r\n\r\n    protocol Animal {\r\n        func move()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then your `associatedtype`, and the related problems, evaporate. And your interface makes more sense. An Animal can move. It isn&#39;t something &quot;with a Mover.&quot; I expect that every use of this type would look pretty much identical to your example: `animal.mover.move()`. That says that `mover` is an implementation detail that callers shouldn&#39;t care about.\r\n\r\nWhat else *could* you do inside a loop over `[Animal]`? How could you write generic code that used `.mover` and *didn&#39;t* call `.move`? There aren&#39;t any other methods.\r\n\r\nI know this is fabricated, but this situation is exactly what comes up in many real cases, and you should be on the lookout for it. When you find yourself reaching for type-erasers, and especially if you start reaching for two levels of type-erasers, you need to ask if you&#39;ve done something wrong. Not always, but most of the time, there is a better solution to the problem in front of you.\r\n\r\nBTW, another approach here would be to keep Movers, but just let them be a protocol. Does the caller really want to know the difference between crawlers and slitherers? Isn&#39;t hiding that the whole goal? If so, you can go this way:\r\n\r\n    protocol Animal {\r\n        var mover: MoverType { get }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd again, all the problems evaporate.\r\n\r\nEither way, you can still automatically implement your `move()` method if there&#39;s a `mover` available. For example, you could design the protocols this way:\r\n\r\n    // Something that moves animals\r\n    protocol Mover {\r\n        func move(animal: Animal)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // Something that has a mover\r\n    protocol MoverProviding {\r\n        var mover: Mover { get }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // And of course Animals. They might be MoverProviding. They might not.\r\n    protocol Animal {\r\n        func move()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // But if they *are* MoverProviding, we can use that.\r\n    extension Animal where Self: MoverProviding {\r\n        func move() {\r\n            mover.move(animal: self)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen you type `associatedtype`, you should generally be thinking &quot;this protocol is all about adding extra algorithms (methods and functions) to other types.&quot; If the point of the protocol is to allow heterogeneous collections, you&#39;re probably on the wrong road. Type-erasers are sometimes useful and important, but if you feel you need them a lot (and *especially* if you need them because of heterogeneous collections), you probably have a design problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124668/swift-type-erasure-attempt-reference-to-invalid-associated-type/58125064#58125064","title":"Swift Type Erasure attempt: &quot;Reference to invalid associated type&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":6952,"user_id":244374,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6250f7993211693b429a2111e373a523?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Matt H.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/244374/matt-h"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58124858,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569534241,"creation_date":1569531353,"question_id":58124668,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124668","body_markdown":"I&#39;m doing a fabricated exercise to try to implement a type-erased container.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nimport Foundation\r\n\r\nprotocol MoverType {\r\n    func move()\r\n}\r\nextension MoverType {\r\n    func move() { print(&quot;\\(type(of: self)) is moving&quot;) }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Slithering: MoverType {}\r\nclass Walking: MoverType {}\r\nclass Trotting: MoverType {}\r\n\r\nprotocol Animal {\r\n    associatedtype Mover: MoverType\r\n    var mover: Mover { get }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Snake: Animal {\r\n    let mover = Slithering()\r\n}\r\nclass Dog: Animal {\r\n    let mover = Trotting()\r\n}\r\nclass Human: Animal {\r\n    let mover = Walking()\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass AnyAnimal: Animal {  // ERROR: Type &#39;AnyAnimal&#39; does not conform to protocol &#39;Animal&#39;\r\n    var _mover: () -&gt; Mover\r\n    init&lt;A: Animal&gt;(animal: A) where Mover == A.Mover {\r\n        _mover = {\r\n            return animal.mover\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ERROR HERE: &quot;Reference to invalid associated type &quot;Mover&quot; of of type &quot;AnyAnimal&quot;\r\n    var mover: Mover { fatalError() }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet d = AnyAnimal(animal: Dog())\r\nlet s = AnyAnimal(animal: Snake())\r\n\r\nlet animals = [d, s]   // Array&lt;AnyAnimal&gt;\r\nfor a in animals {\r\n    a.mover.move()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI deliberately didn&#39;t want my `AnyAnimal` container to be an `AnyAnimal&lt;T&gt;` container.

Even if specific Cognitive Service has a higer TPS such as 50 TPS, maybe you still have 429 error. You should always use the following policy to avoid 429 in the future.\r\n \r\nThe following is the explanation 429 and how to handle 429.\r\n \r\n1. HTTP 429 would indicate RateLimitExceeded, meaning you are making too many API calls per second or minute. \r\n \r\n2. When HTTP 429 happens, you must wait for some time to call API again, or else the next call of API will be refused. Usually we retry the operation using something like an exponential back off retry policy to handle the 429 error:\r\n \r\n2.1) You need check the HTTP response code in your code.\r\n \r\n2.2) When HTTP response code is 429, then retry this operation after N seconds which you can define by yourself such as 10 seconds…\r\n \r\nFor example, the following is a response of 429. You can set your wait time as (26 + n) seconds. (PS: you can define n by yourself here, such as n = 5…)\r\n \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;error&quot;:{\r\n           &quot;statusCode&quot;: 429,\r\n            &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Rate limit is exceeded. Try again in 26 seconds.&quot; \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n2.3) If step 2 succeed, continue the next operation.\r\n \r\n2.4) If step 2 fail with 429 too, retry this operation after N*N seconds (you can define by yourself too) which is an exponential back off retry policy..\r\n \r\n2.5) If step 4 fail with 429 too, retry this operation after N*N*N seconds…\r\n \r\n2.6) You should always wait for current operation to succeed, and the Waiting time will be exponential growth.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58124658/httperror-429-client-error-too-many-requests-for-url-in-python-w-azure-dev/58128070#58128070","title":"&quot;HTTPError: 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url&quot; in Python [w/ Azure developer account]"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12127323,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf06dfa7d6050098ea77d4b46175f244?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fulcizombie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12127323/fulcizombie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1243,"user_id":11342519,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d481d7c4c6219c1453c46ed3b76f7535?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jsamol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11342519/jsamol"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58128070,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569559962,"creation_date":1569531296,"last_edit_date":1569542370,"question_id":58124658,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58124658","body_markdown":"Getting continual exception when trying to run Python code on a small sample directory of 5-20 images.\r\n\r\nI have a developer account with Microsoft (as of this morning) and have inquired with Azure Support, but this issue wasn&#39;t solvable through chat alone.
