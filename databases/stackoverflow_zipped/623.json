So I would like to exclude / remove / drop ALL the rows in between row 15 and the row at which the value &#39;step&#39; goes back to row[15], which in this case is 8 and it can be found at row[23]. [EDITED after first answer received] Keep in mind that the rule is that any subsequent value can only be +/- 1. So, for example, &#39;step&#39; at row[9] is 4, which is smaller than &#39;step&#39; at row[8] which is 5. Such difference is allowed, any difference bigger than +- 1 is not. \r\n\r\nThis is just an example, the real data has hundreds of thousands of rows, so I expect to have this problem more than once in my data frame. \r\n\r\nI have been looking at ways to iterate through the rows with for loops and such, but I have been warned about those methods being very slow. And in any case I could not come up with a working for loop.\r\n\r\nI also failed at finding a smart programatic way of doing this without loops and simply using pandas and some sort of logical indexing. I am not even sure if this is possibile without iterating. For now I can successfully find all the rows at which de difference of row[i] and row[i+1] is bigger than modulus[1] and logically index that, but I am stuck at this point.\r\n\r\nEventually I would a data frame where rows from 16 to 22 are excluded.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Why the number of non-trained parameters is only **14,714,688**. It should be **2 x Non-trainable params**. \r\n\r\nIn later stages, I unfroze the last convolutional block of the network and trained the similarity network along with last CONVO block. \r\n\r\n\r\n    for vggcam_layers, vggcad_layers in zip(vggcam_model.layers[15:], vggcad_model.layers[15:]):\r\n    \tvggcam_layers.trainable, vggcad_layers = (True, True)\r\n\r\nThis also shows the same behavior.

No, when you put `&amp;` before a variable, it means &quot;make me a pointer to this&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo when you called\r\n\r\n    myfunction(&amp;pipelineParms);\r\n\r\nyou had a variable `pipelineParms`, and you created a pointer to it, and it was that pointer you passed to `myfunction`.\r\n\r\nThen, in `myfunction`, `parms` was a pointer (specifically, a pointer to type `ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms`.  Hopefully, `pipelineParms` in `main` was type `ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms` also.)\r\n\r\nSo in `myfunction`, if you want to pass the pointer on to `anotherfunction`, just pass it:\r\n\r\n    anotherfunction(parms);\r\n\r\nWe can see that `anotherfunction` also accepts a pointer to type `ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms`, so this is correct.\r\n\r\nWhen you tried to call `anotherfunction(&amp;parms)`, the `&amp;` said, &quot;make me a pointer to this&quot;.  So you got a pointer to *a pointer to* type `ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms`, or `ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms **`.  That might be fine if that&#39;s what `anotherfunction` expects, but it&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not that C has regular variables, and pointers to regular variables.  You can have pointers to *anything*.  You can have pointers to pointers, and pointers to pointers to pointers, and theoretically you can have 4- and 5- and 6-level pointers, too, all the way up to 12 or more (although in practice anything beyond 3 is extremely rare).\r\n\r\nOne more thing: You said\r\n\r\n    anotherfunction( &amp;parms ); // compile, but application stopped\r\n\r\nbut I&#39;m guessing it did not, in fact, compile properly.  I&#39;m guessing your compiler gave you a warning.  Mine says:\r\n\r\n&gt; warning: incompatible pointer types passing &#39;const ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms **&#39; to parameter of type &#39;const ovrVkGraphicsPipelineParms *&#39;; remove &amp;\r\n\r\nIf your compiler didn&#39;t give you a warning on that line, I encourage you to switch to a better compiler, if at all possible.  (A modern compiler would also warn you about `void main`, which is also wrong, although it&#39;s not causing you any

Thank you.\r\n\r\nForm:\r\n\r\n    $script = &lt;&lt;&lt; JS\r\n\r\n    $(function() {\r\n      enable_cb();\r\n      $(&quot;#irep&quot;).click(enable_cb);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    function enable_cb() {\r\n      if (this.checked) {\r\n        $(&quot;input.irep&quot;).attr(&quot;disabled&quot;, true);\r\n      } else {\r\n        $(&quot;input.irep&quot;).removeAttr(&quot;disabled&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    JS;\r\n    $this-&gt;registerJs($script);\r\n\r\n    &lt;?= $form-&gt;field($model, &#39;irep&#39;)-&gt;checkbox([&#39;id&#39; =&gt; &#39;irep&#39;]) ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;?= $form-&gt;field($model, &#39;intfg&#39;)-&gt;checkbox([&#39;class&#39; =&gt; [&#39;irep&#39;], &#39;disabled&#39; =&gt; $model-&gt;irep]) ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;?= $form-&gt;field($model, &#39;extfg&#39;)-&gt;checkbox([&#39;class&#39; =&gt; [&#39;irep&#39;], &#39;disabled&#39; =&gt; $model-&gt;irep]) ?&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2330209/jquery-checkbox-enable-disable/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392998/jquery-checkbox-enable-disable-with-db","title":"jQuery - checkbox enable/disable - with DB"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","dataframe","datetime"],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":10800593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P0Fifzo20fM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/tfhn3AeTnE8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhas Mehrotra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10800593/abhas-mehrotra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":57,"user_id":10800593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P0Fifzo20fM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJU/tfhn3AeTnE8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhas Mehrotra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10800593/abhas-mehrotra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571202654,"creation_date":1571136833,"last_edit_date":1571202654,"question_id":58392996,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392996","body_markdown":"I have two dataframes:-\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf1:-\r\n\r\nPID\tDATE\t   Time\t  Amount\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t8:37\t100\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t12:30\t100\r\nxy2\t01/10/2019\t5:01\t100\r\nxy3\t01/10/2019\t23:57\t100\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf2\r\nPID\tDATE\tTime\tAmount\tCode\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t8:00\t4\t38\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t8:05\t50\t38\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t8:20\t60\t39\r\nxy1\t01/10/2019\t8:45\t80\t39\r\nxy2\t01/10/2019\t1:02\t100\t39\r\nxy2\t01/10/2019\t3:05\t100\t38\r\nxy2\t01/10/2019\t5:10\t90\t38\r\n```\r\nI want to get the count of ```df1[&#39;PID&#39;]``` depending on the date&amp;time in df1&amp;df2. i.e How many times ```df1[&#39;PID&#39;][0]``` is in df2 before the ```df1[&#39;Date&#39;, &#39;Time&#39;]``` as compared to df2 date time.

I ended up doing is putting a change listener on the list that updates the chart and puts change listeners on all relevant properties of the `Roll`s (which also update the chart):\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nbarchart(x = CategoryAxis(), y = NumberAxis()) {\r\n    animated = true\r\n    updateData(this)\r\n    rolls.forEach {\r\n        it.nameProperty.onChange {

mentioned in my question into a separate function:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun updateData(chart: BarChart&lt;String, Number&gt;){\r\n    chart.data = rolls.map { roll -&gt;\r\n

have an `ObservableList` containing a number of custom objects (`val rolls: ObservableList&lt;Roll&gt;`). Each of these objects has a `val results: ObservableList&lt;Pair&lt;Int, Double&gt;&gt;`. The Pairs represent a possible number and the chance for this result occurring. I would like to visualize these pairs in a `BarChart`. The `Roll`s also contain the name for the series. The results, names and the list of rolls can change at a later time (through user input) and that should be reflected in the chart.\r\n\r\nA minimal sample of the class `Roll` looks like this:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass Roll (\r\n    val results: ObservableList&lt;Pair&lt;Int, Double&gt;&gt;,\r\n    initialName: String\r\n){\r\n    val nameProperty = SimpleStringProperty(initialName)\r\n    var name by nameProperty\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried is the following:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nbarchart(x = CategoryAxis(), y = NumberAxis()) {\r\n    data = rolls.map { roll -&gt;\r\n        XYChart.Series&lt;String, Number&gt;(roll.name, roll.results.map { (result, chance) -&gt;\r\n            XYChart.Data&lt;String, Number&gt;(result.toString(), chance)\r\n        }.asObservable())\r\n    }.asObservable()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis successfully maps the data to the correct form and displays it. The problem with this approach is of course that it does not reflect changes to `rolls` or elements in `rolls`.

But what I want is to make the code not compile if it isn&#39;t there.\r\n\r\nI also know that I could get all those loader methods at startup and store them in a static Type-Loader map, but still it would only throw an exception during application startup.\r\n\r\nFor this example I am using a texture loader that should be able to load different types of textures as long as they inherit the same base class.\r\n(OpenGL Texture Wrappers, DX Texture Wrappers, Video Textures, etc)\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic abstract class DataContainer&lt;T&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public abstract T Load(object someArgs);\r\n\r\n    [...]\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class TextureContainer&lt;T&gt; : DataContainer&lt;T&gt; where T : Texture&lt;T&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public override T Load(object someArgs)\r\n    {\r\n        if (/*is currently loaded*/)\r\n            return GetLoadedFile(someArgs);\r\n        else\r\n            return T.FromFile(someArgs);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    [...]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nA base class for texture would look something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic abstract class Texture&lt;T&gt; where T : Texture&lt;T&gt;\r\n{\r\n    //works fine, forces derived class to declare a type safe Clone method\r\n    public abstract T Clone();\r\n\r\n    //sadly for static methods I can&#39;t do the same\r\n    //so I need another way here\r\n    public static /*abstract*/ T FromFile(object someArgs);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen a concrete implementation of texture would look like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class DirectXTexture : Texture&lt;DirectXTexture&gt;\r\n{\r\n    //works fine\r\n    public override DirectXTexture Clone()\r\n    {\r\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    //another way needed\r\n    public static /*override*/ DirectXTexture FromFile()\r\n    {\r\n        throw new System.NotImplementedException();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHaving this setup you could simply get a texture by using the following code with the base DataContainer loading and unloading the texture whenever necessary or performing the loading task in a background thread.\r\n```csharp\r\nstatic class Program\r\n{\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n        var container = new TextureContainer&lt;DirectXTexture&gt;();\r\n        var tex = container.Load(&quot;some file&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust to clarify: I already have a fully working DataContainer construct that can load resources in main or background threads and monitor instances that reference my resources so I can unload them if nobody needs them anymore. The only thing I need is the functionality of creating a container for an ABSTRACT type with their corresponding load methods so I do not have to create a seperate sub class for DXTextureContainer, GLTextureContainer, VideoTextureContainer etc.\r\n\r\nI hope you guys can help me here.\r\nThanks in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392955/is-there-a-way-to-force-a-derived-type-to-declare-a-static-method-with-a-specifi","title":"Is there a way to force a derived type to declare a static method with a specific signature?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12194728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a24d7f5a749d4c11e4d48ceb79930c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cxbalt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12194728/cxbalt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571139139,"post_id":58393164,"comment_id":103133112,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392952/where-am-i-going-wrong-with-the-login-screen-def-login/58393164#comment103133112_58393164"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":10305477,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--qRrIlzhZP8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAbg/OMHxlGTcZp4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chase","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10305477/chase"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571137332,"creation_date":1571137332,"answer_id":58393164,"question_id":58392952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393164","body_markdown":"You&#39;ve done the definition correctly, however you&#39;ve never *used* that function anywhere.

For example, let&#39;s say you have a huge database of products (2 or 3 tables) and it&#39;s not possible to filter them in 1 or 2 SQL tasks, but you need to `SELECT` every product with `JOIN` to another tables individually. Which could make even 1000+ SQL `SELECT JOIN` tasks.\r\n\r\nIs it better to make 1000 SQL `SELECT JOIN` tasks (which is really quick as much as I was playing around with SQL) or just 1 SQL task and huge PHP `#foreach` for the filtering (instead of many SQL tasks?) \r\n\r\nIt seems the PHP is slower but it may be safer since it&#39;s not manipulating with database directly but only with already selected data?\r\n\r\nFor example: If you have many filter options and need to filter through more tables, for example \r\n\r\n`select * from products where product.visibility = 1 JOIN species on species.product_prodID = product.prodID` \r\n\r\nand you want at least 1 specie from table species has visibility 1 as well, because if there is no specie that is visible, you don&#39;t want to show this product in your search. Please note, that one product can have 1+ species, not only one. Each specie may be a color of T-shirt for example.\r\n\r\nSo I can&#39;t decide, if it&#39;s better to check every specie with SQL or just query them all and then filter it with PHP since the search needs to be as fast as possible but safe at the same time. Which is more performant? Are there reasons to choose the less-performant?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392922/1000-sql-tasks-or-huge-php-foreach","closed_reason":"primarily opinion-based","title":"1000 SQL tasks OR huge PHP foreach?"},{"tags":["api"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12220047,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fnDOqzARVlU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd01hJ7NLCNrmmfIaVsGxs3NFzd1A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Talent Code","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12220047/talent-code"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571136616,"creation_date":1571136616,"question_id":58392921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58392921","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get an API key for Aliseeks.\r\nI&#39;ve created an account on AliExpress but I can&#39;t log in to Aliseeks.\r\nPlease help me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392921/how-to-get-aliseeks-api-key-and-how-to-log-in-to-aliseeks","title":"How to get Aliseeks api key?

Each of them has a unique client ID, in order to get/send messages from/to dedicated topics.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to achieve this using MQTT inbound/outbound Integration Flows in Spring Boot (spring-integration-mqtt-5.1.6.RELEASE), but each flow (`MqttPahoMessageDrivenChannelAdapter/MqttPahoMessageHandler`) instantiates its own client to manage the incoming/outgoing messages.\r\n\r\nMy concerns are:\r\n\r\n - By definition, I cannot use just one client for the in/out flow due to the Spring Boot MQTT integration flows&#39; structure.\r\n - It might not be efficient, because I need two different clients, thus double resources.\r\n - I cannot use the same Client ID for each &quot;logical&quot; channel because I&#39;m using two different MQTT Clients and as you know if you try to connect to the same broker with the same Client Id, the oldest one gets disconnected. Thus I need different configurations (and server-side authorizations) for each logical in/out flow in order to send and receive messages.\r\n - The Spring Boot Application generates 2 times connections towards the server, so the server must be sized to receive 2 times the incoming connections and this might be a problem.\r\n\r\nThe general idea I have is to reimplement `MqttPahoMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` and `MqttPahoMessageHandler` in order to let them share the same MqttClient instance for the same Client ID. To do this, I have to reimplement the connection/disconnection/subscription methods within the Adapter and the Handler in order to make them robust. Also, I have to use a dedicated Client Factory in order to return the same client for the same Client ID (this is the easiest part).\r\n\r\nNow the question is: is this approach correct? Am I raping Spring Boot trying to do so?\r\n\r\nThe only alternative I found is to implement raw MqttClients directly, managing their entire lifecycle. This is working, but I&#39;m reinventing the wheel and I&#39;m not leveraging the messaging design pattern of Spring Boot.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392900/sharing-same-mqtt-client-instance-between-mqttpahomessagehandler-and-mqttpahomes","title":"Sharing same MQTT Client instance between MqttPahoMessageHandler and MqttPahoMessageDrivenChannelAdapter in Spring Boot Integration"},{"tags":["python","django","django-rest-framework","django-rest-framework-jwt"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1594,"user_id":5108404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lVueJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toan Quoc Ho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5108404/toan-quoc-ho"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571138064,"creation_date":1571138064,"answer_id":58393372,"question_id":58392899,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393372","body_markdown":"That&#39;s because `django-allauth` has nothing to do with `django-rest-framework-jwt`.

You want the query to only read the relevant partitions.\r\n\r\nPartition pruning is quite tricky.  The basic problem is that the query needs to know what data to read *before* it starts executing the query.  This is usually handled by requiring explicit comparisons on the partitioning column.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the right partitions should work correctly with `=`, `&gt;`, `&gt;=`, `&lt;`, and `&lt;=`.  It might get more complicated with `in` and `not in`.  It probably will not work when you use a `join` on one table and don&#39;t explicit include the partition for both tables in the join.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58392882/query-by-multiple-values-from-an-aws-athena-bucketed-table/58393075#58393075","title":"Query by multiple values from an AWS Athena bucketed
