This is how my table looks:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nClicking on that &#39;+&#39; button would open up a sub-rows:\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I try to Drag &#39;John Brown sr.&#39; row and drop on &#39;Joe Black&#39; row, it works correctly:\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5r9FJ.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2FQN8.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ibWV3.png\r\n\r\nBut When I try to Drag and Drop sub-rows, the outer rows gets changed. For Example, if I try to Drag &#39;John Brown jr.&#39; row and drop it on &#39;John Brown&#39; row, the &#39;John Brown sr.&#39; row gets replaced with &#39;Joe Black&#39; row. Forgive me if it doesn&#39;t help but I would have embedded a GiF or Video of the problem but I don&#39;t know how. \r\n I would really appreciate any help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396605/how-to-enable-dragdrop-in-ant-designs-tree-data-structure","title":"How to enable Drag&amp;Drop in Ant Design&#39;s Tree Data Structure?"},{"tags":["sql-server","tsql","deployment","sql-server-data-tools","sqlclr"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":966,"user_id":2241653,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2dbbb77d187d8d20b4819c233738e577?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mburm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241653/mburm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571152565,"post_id":58397362,"comment_id":103141208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396602/deploy-visual-studio-database-project-objects-to-schema-other-than-dbo/58397362#comment103141208_58397362"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":966,"user_id":2241653,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2dbbb77d187d8d20b4819c233738e577?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mburm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241653/mburm"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571150873,"creation_date":1571150873,"answer_id":58397362,"question_id":58396602,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58397362","body_markdown":"I could it resolve it myself.

Starting in Visual Studio 2012, there&#39;s an option to set the Schema for the T-SQL wrapper objects. In the project properties, go to the &quot;Project Settings&quot; tab, and on the right side, under the &quot;General&quot; section, there is a text field labeled: &quot;Default schema&quot;. That is the Schema used for the T-SQL wrapper objects (I don&#39;t usually use the SSDT deployment so I just reconfirmed this info in Visual Studio 2015 &amp;mdash; I know, I know, I _really_ need to update).\r\n\r\nThis was also mentioned in my answer to: [Schema for CLR Stored Procedure During Deployment][1]\r\n\r\nIf the version of Visual Studio / SSDT you are using does not have the option to set the Schema ***OR*** if you need to place the objects into multiple Schemas, then you should be able to simply add a T-SQL post-deployment script that moves the objects to the desired schema. By adding a T-SQL script and setting the properties to &quot;post deployment&quot; (or something similar to that), it will get inserted at the end of the generated publish script.\r\n\r\nIf it&#39;s only a small number of objects that won&#39;t really have new objects introduced, you can do explicit statements for each object:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER SCHEMA [foo] TRANSFER [dbo].[MyProc];\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it&#39;s a large number of objects and/or new objects will be added occasionally and you don&#39;t want to deal with remembering to add them to this post-deployment include script, you can cycle through the list of objects that are associated with that assembly to create a Dynamic SQL script that can move them all without anything but the Assembly name being hard-coded (and technically that might even be able to be dynamic using MSBuild / SSDT variables):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX) = N&#39;&#39;;\r\n\r\nSELECT @SQL += N&#39;ALTER SCHEMA [foo] TRANSFER [dbo].&#39;\r\n               + QUOTENAME(obj.[name]) + N&#39;;&#39; + NCHAR(0x0D) + NCHAR(0x0A)\r\nFROM   sys.assembly_modules amd\r\nINNER JOIN sys.assemblies asm\r\n        ON asm.[assembly_id] = amd.[assembly_id]\r\nINNER JOIN sys.objects obj\r\n        ON obj.[object_id] = amd.[object_id]\r\nWHERE  asm.[name] = N&#39;Company.Area.Technology.ProjectName&#39; -- do not use [ and ] here\r\nAND    SCHEMA_NAME(obj.[schema_id]) = N&#39;dbo&#39;\r\n\r\nPRINT @SQL; -- DEBUG (else, comment out)\r\n\r\nEXEC (@SQL);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32273788/577765","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396602/deploy-visual-studio-database-project-objects-to-schema-other-than-dbo/58397676#58397676","title":"Deploy Visual Studio Database Project Objects to Schema other than &quot;dbo&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":966,"user_id":2241653,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2dbbb77d187d8d20b4819c233738e577?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mburm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2241653/mburm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":35697,"user_id":577765,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tYyIG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Solomon Rutzky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/577765/solomon-rutzky"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58397676,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571165649,"creation_date":1571148359,"last_edit_date":1571153102,"question_id":58396602,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396602","body_markdown":"I have the following scenario.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve got a SQLCLR stored procedure in a Visual Studio database project.

This works for most users, but fails for users who are hosted on goDaddy. I investigated the issue and `%{HTTP_COOKIE}` is only set when the browser requests a PHP file. When an image file is requested `HTTP_COOKIE` is empty and thus apache returns a 403 forbidden back to the browser. I assume goDaddy does this to squeez the last drop of performance out of the servers. This leads me to two questions:\r\n\r\n 1. Is there any way how I can still get the cookie in the .htaccess file? \r\n 1. Or is there a way how I can detect that apache is configured to not parse cookies when static files are requested?

This can get reused in all your other action methods you will need. \r\n\r\n```\r\n  static bool WaitForControlToBeClickable(By SeleniumObject, int waitFor = 10)\r\n        {\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(waitFor));\r\n                wait.Until(SeleniumExtras.WaitHelpers.ExpectedConditions.ElementIsVisible(SeleniumObject));\r\n                return true;\r\n            }\r\n            catch (Exception er)\r\n            {\r\n                return false;\r\n                throw er;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext you&#39;ll make a method to click and call the previous method inside:\r\n```\r\n        public void Click(By SeleniumObject)\r\n        {\r\n            WaitForControlClickable(SeleniumObject);\r\n            driver.FindElement(SeleniumObject).Click();\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can store these in another class - CommonActions. So once you instantiate that in your test you can call it like this:\r\n```\r\ncommonAction.Click(MyObject);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also recommend storing your objects in an object repository separately that you call with your actions to create tests.

are 2 things to not mix:\r\n\r\n* The git `tag` \r\n* The Cloud Build `tag`\r\n\r\nThe git `tag` is a value that you put in your repository to get the code at a certain point of time. The `git ls-remote` command is the right one for this. However the tag is empty and the `ls-remote` takes the `ssh://` git url as the tag name. \r\n\r\nThe [Cloud Build `tag`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/builds/submit#--tag) if the name of your container in the gcr docker hub. it&#39;s usually `gcr.io/&lt;project_id&gt;/&lt;name that you want&gt;`\r\n\r\nFor solving your issue, you have 2 solutions:\r\n\r\n* Use `docker build` command. Use the `tag` to name your container, and use an environment variable `-e GIT_TAG=xxx` to use in your Dockerfile to specify the git tag\r\n* Use Cloud Build config file, by default `cloudbuild.yaml` and use the same logic with environment variable in your `Dockerfile`. For passing your `GIT_TAG` to the Cloud Build, use [substitution variables](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/configuring-builds/substitute-variable-values). You can use your own substitution variable which must start by underscore, or use the predefined `TAG_NAME` variable.

Perform any interaction with the page, ideally check and uncheck one of the boxes. \r\n\r\nNow, if you check your console, you might expect to see the checkboxLabel console log, appear once for every mat-checkbox. So if you put three in, you&#39;d expect to see it, **3** times. \r\n\r\nBut if you followed those instructions exactly, you&#39;ll actually see the console log, **many** times depending on exactly what you kept in your test page and the set up of your project. And by many, we mean certainly **9+ times**. \r\n\r\n**How Did This Happen?**\r\n\r\nEssentially, core to how Angular works, anytime there is a change in the DOM, every element with a method such as this has to be re-evaluated. It doesn&#39;t inherently cache the previous value and compare them, so it has to perform the calculation again, and return a result. \r\n\r\nSo if you had 20 divs with displayName() in them, that&#39;s many changes EVERY time there is a change. Which understandably causes a massive performance issue. When you think that most pages have much more than this displayed, you can see how people struggle to keep their applications performant, not because they&#39;re bad at coding - but because they might not understand exactly what&#39;s making it lag behind the scenes. \r\n\r\n**How Might You Overcome This?** \r\n\r\nPipes. \r\n\r\nIf we instead convert our method into a pipe which can still utilize this method, we CAN take advantage of this caching method, and make our overall app performant.\r\n\r\nPipes will ONLY return a different result, and will only call their function, IF the input changes. \r\n\r\nSo for easiness sake: lets set up a dummy ts file, that has the following array. \r\n\r\n    labelExamples = [\r\n        { row: &#39;1&#39; },\r\n        { row: &#39;1&#39; },\r\n        { row: &#39;3&#39; }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nAnd an html file that has the following code: \r\n\r\n    &lt;ng-container *ngFor=&quot;let l of labelExamples&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;{{checkboxLabel(l.row)}}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ng-container&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd finally, let&#39;s jump back into our ts file and say our checkboxLabel function looks like this: \r\n\r\n      checkboxLabel(row: string) {\r\n        switch (row) {\r\n          case &#39;1&#39;:\r\n            console.log(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\n            return &#39;Row 1 Label&#39;;\r\n          default:\r\n            console.warn(&quot;hello from the other side&quot;);\r\n            return &#39;Any other row label&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n(You can use this to test exactly what I&#39;ve described as above.)\r\n\r\nWell if you run this, you&#39;ll see exactly as I described, many instances of the console log &quot;Hello&quot; and &quot;Hello from the other side&quot;.\r\n\r\nBut, if we change this to a pipe we could convert the above to the following\r\n\r\n    import { Pipe, PipeTransform } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    @Pipe({\r\n      name: &#39;checkboxLabelPipe&#39;\r\n    })\r\n    export class checkboxLabelPipe implements PipeTransform {\r\n      transform(row: string | string): string {\r\n        if (row) {\r\n          return this.checkboxLabel(row);\r\n        }\r\n        return row;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      checkboxLabel(row: string): string {\r\n        switch(row) {\r\n          case &#39;1&#39;: \r\n            console.log(&#39;Row 1 called&#39;);\r\n          return &#39;Row 1 Label&#39;;\r\n          default: \r\n            console.log(&#39;Any other row called&#39;);\r\n          return &#39;Any other row label&#39;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRemember this is a pipe, and so it will have to be declared in an NgModule that it&#39;s used in, or the global NgModule. \r\n\r\nIf you were to run this instead, keeping the same html file, and the same array of labelExamples, you would see the exact same result as before except if you look in your console logs, you&#39;ll see closer to what you would originally expect. 3 console logs. \r\n\r\nBy understanding exactly when and how calculations are performed in Angular, and when best to use functions or pipes, you can greatly increase the performance of your entire application. \r\n\r\nYou can read up more on how Pipes go about achieving this, at the Angular Documentation. \r\n[Angular Pipes Documentation](https://angular.io/guide/pipes)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, for even greater performance boosts, you can look into the memo decorator. \r\n[The memo-decorator npm can be found here.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/memo-decorator) \r\nwhich caches already calculated results and saves you even more performance by returning results it has stored instead of even putting them through the process. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396544/can-calling-simple-methods-in-angular-component-templates-cause-performance-issu/58397926#58397926","title":"Can Calling Simple Methods in Angular Component Templates Cause Performance Issues?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12220849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acc63379cef31411fab5505f18dba2ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"7R1X","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12220849/7r1x"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58397926,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571152562,"creation_date":1571148209,"question_id":58396544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396544","body_markdown":"From reading several Angular resources (see below), calling methods in templates can cause performance issues.

(well, module order declaration helps a bit), because you are using a route to match **everything**, even what should be matched by the api route.\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest you is to add the priority to those routes, in order to be sure that the &quot;match everything&quot;

(And I know it&#39;s rather wrong approach)\r\n\r\nI want to write a test that expects some of these methods to be called with different arguments:\r\n\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_1)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n    ...\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_2)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n    ...\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_3)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n\r\nThe thing is that at one time there should be only one valid input to the method. How should I do it without using `VerifyAndClearExpectations`? (I want to still keep some other expectations set for different methods on the same mock).\r\n\r\nI think I can achieve that with additional expectations as follows:\r\n\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(_).Times(0);\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_1)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n    ...\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(_).Times(0);\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_2)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n    ...\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(_).Times(0);\r\n    EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(VAL_3)).Times(AtLeast(1));\r\n    \r\nIs that a correct approach or I&#39;m missing something? What if code above will be executed in a loop of thousand cycles? Are those expectations held on some stack that I eventually consume or the `EXPECT_CALL(mock, foo(_).Times(0);` will magically clear all the expectations above?\r\n\r\nMaybe I shouldn&#39;t be affraid of using `VerifyAndClearExpectations` and just write several tests instead of one that executes very similar (even same) scenarios but checking different expectations?\r\nIn current scenario I have some expectations that should be valid during whole test and some will change several times in a way I described above.\r\n\r\nAre there any good papers/guidelines for dealing with such and other tricky situations using GMock? I didn&#39;t found it&#39;s documentation useful for determining when should I use particular mechanisms of gmock.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396446/gmock-changing-expectation-on-method-arguments-without-verifyandclearexpectati","title":"gmock: changing expectation on method arguments

So your regular expression should be `&quot;\\\\[1]&quot;` instead of `&quot;\\\\[1\\\\]&quot;` to be standard-compliant.\r\n\r\nLooking at the standard library source code, there is the following in [regex_scanner.tcc](https://github.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/blob/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/bits/regex_scanner.tcc#L417):\r\n\r\n    #ifdef __STRICT_ANSI__\r\n          // POSIX says it is undefined to escape ordinary characters\r\n          __throw_regex_error(regex_constants::error_escape,\r\n                      &quot;Unexpected escape character.&quot;);\r\n    #else\r\n          _M_token = _S_token_ord_char;\r\n          _M_value.assign(1, __c);\r\n    #endif\r\n\r\nWhich shows that it is a GNU extension to allow escaping non-special characters. I don&#39;t know where this extension is documented.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396433/c-standard-regex-difference-between-std-c11-and-std-gnu11/58396616#58396616","title":"C++ standard regex difference between std=c++11 and std=gnu++11"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9391972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7050a78cb5f20e02e50a81fd7cb35c55?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"123tv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9391972/123tv"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58396616,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571149015,"creation_date":1571147840,"question_id":58396433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58396433","body_markdown":"There seems to be a difference in regex behavior when comiling code using regex and gnu extensions.\r\n\r\nThe following code produces an exception when compiliing with -std=c++11, however -std=gnu++11 works:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;regex&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char **argv) {\r\n\r\n\tstd::string rex { &quot;\\\\[1\\\\]&quot; };\r\n\tstd::string str { &quot;[1]&quot; };\r\n\tstd::regex regex(rex, std::regex::extended);\r\n\tauto match = std::regex_match(str.begin(), str.end(), regex);\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Result is &quot; &lt;&lt; match &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nI tried gcc from 4.9.4 up to 9.2 with same behavior.

The function for background color of widget I left the same and everything else. The result is as expected half green / half red. Anyway I think I should include macro Q_Object as written in link over there because it is a Qt class, but it does work without. Maybe there is a small bug in Qt??? To sum up if you delete Q_Object macro it works.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396419/qt-c-widget-inside-widget-does-not-appear","title":"Qt/C++ widget inside widget does not appear"},{"tags":["r","loops","dplyr"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":408,"user_id":4114240,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKgFc.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"markhogue","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4114240/markhogue"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571148715,"post_id":58396574,"comment_id":103138888,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396417/create-multiple-new-dataframes-based-on-rows-in-another-dataframe-with-a-for-loo/58396574#comment103138888_58396574"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11373902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25a91b3059838a651ceb5ea9aba9bbf2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheEconomist","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11373902/theeconomist"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149468,"post_id":58396574,"comment_id":103139355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396417/create-multiple-new-dataframes-based-on-rows-in-another-dataframe-with-a-for-loo/58396574#comment103139355_58396574"},{"owner":{"reputation":1680,"user_id":403582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQQNe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deepseefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403582/deepseefan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11373902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25a91b3059838a651ceb5ea9aba9bbf2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheEconomist","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11373902/theeconomist"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571150119,"post_id":58396574,"comment_id":103139749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396417/create-multiple-new-dataframes-based-on-rows-in-another-dataframe-with-a-for-loo/58396574#comment103139749_58396574"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11373902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25a91b3059838a651ceb5ea9aba9bbf2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheEconomist","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11373902/theeconomist"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571150729,"post_id":58396574,"comment_id":103140097,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396417/create-multiple-new-dataframes-based-on-rows-in-another-dataframe-with-a-for-loo/58396574#comment103140097_58396574"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1680,"user_id":403582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQQNe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deepseefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403582/deepseefan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1680,"user_id":403582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JQQNe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deepseefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/403582/deepseefan"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571150140,"last_edit_date":1571150140,"creation_date":1571148296,"answer_id":58396574,"question_id":58396417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396574","body_markdown":"Try this: \r\n```r\r\nlibrary(stringr)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(magrittr)\r\n\r\ndf %&gt;%\r\n  gather(Year, Values, 3:5) %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(Year = str_sub(Year, 2)) %&gt;%\r\n  select(ID, Year, Values) %&gt;%\r\n  group_split(ID) # split(.$ID) \r\n\r\n# [[1]]\r\n# # A tibble: 3 x 3\r\n#     ID Year  Values\r\n#   &lt;dbl&gt;

Create a new data.frame for every row in df\r\n2. Names the new dataframe with a combination of &quot;ID&quot; and &quot;Type&quot; (A_1, A_2, ... , C_6)\r\n\r\nThe resulting new dataframes should look like this (example for A_1, A_2 and C_6):\r\n\r\n      Year Values\r\n    1 2019      1\r\n    2 2020      2\r\n    3 2021      3\r\n    \r\n      Year Values\r\n    1 2019      2\r\n    2 2020      3\r\n    3 2021      4\r\n\r\n      Year Values\r\n    1 2019      6\r\n    2 2020      7\r\n    3 2021      8\r\n\r\nI have some things that somehow complicate the code:\r\n1. The code should work in the next few years without any changes, meaning next year the data.frame df will no longer contain the years 2019-2021, but rather 2020-2022. \r\n2. As the data.frame df is only a minimal reproducible example, I need some kind of loop. In the &quot;real&quot; data, I have a lot more rows and therefore a lot more dataframes to be created.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can&#39;t give you any code, as I have absolutely no idea how I could manage that.\r\nWhile researching, I found the following code that may help adress the first problem with the changing years:\r\n\r\n    year &lt;- as.numeric(format(Sys.Date(), &quot;%Y&quot;))\r\n\r\nFurther, I read about list, and that it may help to work with a list in a for loop and then transform the list back into a dataframe.

Those technical reasons are outlined in [a blog post](https://jimevansmusic.blogspot.com/2014/09/screenshots-sendkeys-and-sixty-four.html) written by the driver author (me) some years ago. The tricky bit is knowing whether the browser is actually 32-bit or 64-bit.\r\n\r\nYou see, IE uses multiple processes when browsing, notably a broker process (which handles the outer frame of the browser), and content processes (usually one per tab, which actually renders the content). Starting with IE10, though, the challenge is that those processes (the broker and the content processes) can have _**different**_ bitnesses. In fact, on 64-bit Windows, this is the default, where the broker process is 64-bit, and the content processes are 32-bit. Element interactions like sending keystrokes happen in the content process, so that’s what the driver must match.\r\n\r\nThat means the most common case is that one should use the 32-bit IE driver, even on 64-bit Windows. It must be pointed out that there are some cases where one can get a 64-bit content process (usually based on Enhanced Protected Mode), but these are a vast minority of cases.

Is there any relation between OS bit version ?? like if OS is 64 IE should also be 64 ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396412/how-iedriver-bit-is-determined-for-the-execution","title":"How IEDriver bit is determined for the execution"},{"tags":["python","django","reactjs","react-native"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W1lnXfO1_Jo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcA--BzHmI1YnPlTgOMkWJNu7lZLQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Denis L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216443/denis-l"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571148715,"post_id":58396549,"comment_id":103138887,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396411/react-native-with-python/58396549#comment103138887_58396549"},{"owner":{"reputation":2192,"user_id":5616096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjKci.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Gaiser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5616096/matthew-gaiser"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W1lnXfO1_Jo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcA--BzHmI1YnPlTgOMkWJNu7lZLQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Denis L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216443/denis-l"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149201,"post_id":58396549,"comment_id":103139191,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396411/react-native-with-python/58396549#comment103139191_58396549"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-W1lnXfO1_Jo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcA--BzHmI1YnPlTgOMkWJNu7lZLQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Denis L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216443/denis-l"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571149805,"post_id":58396549,"comment_id":103139541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396411/react-native-with-python/58396549#comment103139541_58396549"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2192,"user_id":5616096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjKci.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthew Gaiser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5616096/matthew-gaiser"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571148224,"creation_date":1571148224,"answer_id":58396549,"question_id":58396411,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396549","body_markdown":"Django by itself works as a model, template, view framework, with the actual HTML the user sees first generated server side and then sent to the user.

based on the assumption that you want to create a `form` for each `file` you can try something like this with the `map` method.\r\nThe `map` method takes an array and creates a `new array` based on a reference of the previous array:\r\n\r\n````jsx\r\n\r\nconst response = await dataProvider(GET_MANY, &#39;vid&#39;, { ids: videoId })\r\nconst file = response.data;\r\nvar arrayPosition = 0;\r\n\r\nlet formPerFile = file.map( f =&gt; {\r\n  \r\n  var sigkey = &quot;key&quot;;\r\n  var formBody = new FormData();\r\n  formBody.set(&#39;ver&#39;, &quot;1.2&quot;);\r\n  formBody.set(&#39;key&#39;, &quot;key&quot;);\r\n  // HEre instead of use the reference of file wth the arrayIndex we just can use the f variable provided by our iterator \r\n  formBody.set(&#39;video_id&#39;, f.file);\r\n  formBody.set(&#39;user_id&#39;, &quot;1234&quot;);\r\n  formBody.set(&#39;format&#39;, &quot;json&quot;);\r\n  formBody.set(&#39;ip&#39;,

[formBody.get(&#39;video_id&#39;), formBody.get(&#39;user_id&#39;),  formBody.get(&#39;ip&#39;), formBody.get(&#39;tts&#39;), formBody.get(&#39;ver&#39;), formBody.get(&#39;key&#39;),

formBodyStringified = new URLSearchParams(formBody).toString();\r\n\r\n// YOu need to make this request per file? \r\n// Or you have a service taht can `post` all the forms from one request?\r\n  const resJson = await fetch(Config.api.livebox, {\r\n       method: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n       body: formBodyStringified,\r\n       headers: {\r\n          &#39;Content-Type&#39;:

store the video sources returned from the map method in your state instead of storing just one value\r\n   this.setState({ videoSource: formsPerFile });\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nIs this approach correct for your objective? or are you trying something different?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396399/update-value-of-state-when-looping-through-object/58397060#58397060","title":"Update

What I&#39;d like to do is read the user based on otherMails (which will be unique among active users)but when I attempt to upload a custom policy with a step to Read the user from the B2C directory by the otherMails claim I get a validation message &#39;.Input Claim &#39;otherMails&#39; is not supported in Azure Active Directory Provider technical profile &#39;SelfAsserted-TargetEmailExchangeFederated&#39; of policy &#39;B2C_1A_Impersonation&#39;.\r\n \r\n&#39;otherMails&#39; is defined in the base policy so it seems it is just not supported to &#39;Read&#39; on. I get this same error message if I try the mailNickname attribute. I can successfully upload and run the policy searching by other attributes such as employeeId, or immutableId however these have other limitations (size, uniqueness) that don&#39;t make them viable to store email addresses in. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to read a user profile by otherMails? \r\n\r\nIf not, is there another field I could use? (I tried adding an extended attribute, policy would run but the account would not be found). \r\n\r\nShort of either of those, is there a way to read the account from our corporate AAD by email from the custom policy? (calling the graph api, etc?)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396396/how-to-impersonate-a-federated-user-given-an-email-address","title":"How to impersonate a federated user given an email address"},{"tags":["swift","in-app-purchase"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":4527580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001466604802/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fiko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4527580/fiko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571478643,"post_id":58396799,"comment_id":103260572,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396395/date-of-app-purchase-date-in-swift-start-or-end-date/58396799#comment103260572_58396799"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":4527580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001466604802/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fiko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4527580/fiko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571771383,"post_id":58396799,"comment_id":103349251,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58396395/date-of-app-purchase-date-in-swift-start-or-end-date/58396799#comment103349251_58396799"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":256,"user_id":1183744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PomEu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"apphud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1183744/apphud"},"last_editor":{"reputation":256,"user_id":1183744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PomEu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"apphud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1183744/apphud"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149588,"last_edit_date":1571149588,"creation_date":1571149041,"answer_id":58396799,"question_id":58396395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396799","body_markdown":"Fiko!

By starting to code this, I realised that this idea brings more complications than built in CakePHP add and edit methods, thing is, my mentor insists that I merge this so I shall try it, even if i personally think this is not the best approach.\r\n\r\nItemTypesController.php\r\n\r\n    class ItemTypesController extends AppController {\r\n    public function save($id = null) {\r\n    \tif($this-&gt;request-&gt;is(array(&#39;post&#39;, &#39;put&#39;))){\r\n    \t\t$this-&gt;ItemType-&gt;set($this-&gt;request-&gt;data);\r\n            //if i put an exit() funct here, it exits on this spot\r\n    \t\tif($this-&gt;ItemType-&gt;validates()){\r\n    \t\t\tif(!$id){\r\n    \t\t\t\t$this-&gt;ItemType-&gt;create();\r\n    \t\t\t\tif ($this-&gt;ItemType-&gt;save($this-&gt;request-&gt;data)) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t$this-&gt;Flash-&gt;success(__(&#39;The item type has been saved.&#39;));\r\n    \t\t\t\t\treturn $this-&gt;redirect(array(&#39;action&#39; =&gt; &#39;index&#39;));\r\n    \t\t\t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t$this-&gt;Flash-&gt;error(__(&#39;The item type could not be saved.

And it works fine for create, but, when I try to update it it always requires that any field must be changed, because of &quot;isUnique&quot; rule, i set that rule to be only for create, but CakePHP prolly thinks of its create function, albeit here is used my save() funct and it probably thinks it needs to enter that rule for my funct.\r\n\r\nItemType.php\r\n\r\n    class ItemType extends AppModel {\r\n    \r\n    public $classes = array(\r\n    \t&#39;product&#39;

While it says that it seems the connection has been lost, all the other tables are accessible without any issue.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am also still able to get all the records in the table with SQLAlchemy (and other libraries). The size of the BLOB is 8.5MiB, which should be fine since LONGBLOB&#39;s can hold 4GiB, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s not the size of the image that&#39;s causing problems.\r\n\r\nWhen inserting the record, SQLAlchemy shows the following warning:\r\n`/home/aaa/.conda/envs/AAA/lib/python3.6/site-packages/pymysql/cursors.py:170: Warning: (1300, &quot;Invalid utf8mb4 character string: &#39;900130&#39;&quot;)\r\n  result = self._query(query)`  \r\nWhich is something I have tried Googling, but could not find anything that helped out. The collation of the database and table is *utf8mb4_unicode_ci*. The collation for the specific field could not be set, as far as I know, since it&#39;s a BLOB.\r\n\r\nI have not had troubles in the past storing images as BLOBs in a MySQL database, so I am at a loss on what to do now to solve this issue. Is it wrong to use Numpy&#39;s `.tobytes()` to get the bytes of the Numpy array?
