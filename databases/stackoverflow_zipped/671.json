If you can see the music is playing and it has a URL. I want to get\r\n&gt; this URL when music starts playing. How can I do that?\r\n\r\nIf you are loading the website into a `WebView`, the easiest possible way you can get the URL by intercept the requests through `WebViewClient` and check if the URL contains &#39;.mp3&#39;. See the following example,\r\n\r\n    public class YourWebViewClient extends WebViewClient {\r\n            @Override\r\n            public WebResourceResponse shouldInterceptRequest(WebView view, WebResourceRequest request) {\r\n                String url = request.getUrl().toString();\r\n                if (url.contains(&quot;.mp3&quot;)) {\r\n                    Log.d(TAG, &quot;MP3 url = [&quot; + url + &quot;]&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n                return super.shouldInterceptRequest(view, request);\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&gt; And how can I get URL of music which is playing in some app? Is it\r\n&gt; possible?\r\n\r\nYes possible but not too easy especially if you are going to get it from SSL traffic. To sniff other app&#39;s network traffic you need to perform [MITM][1]. There are a couple of apps in the play store which are doing exactly the same thing. You can look into [HttpCanary][2] app for reference. Basically you need to perform the following steps -\r\n\r\n 1. Set up a proxy server\r\n 2. Configure your device to pass its network traffic to that proxy server\r\n 3. Ask the proxy server to give you the network data\r\n 4. Analyze the network data to see if it contains &#39;mp3&#39; URL\r\n\r\nIf you need to intercept https traffic, you need to generate and install an SSL certificate.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/MegatronKing/HttpCanary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382049/how-to-get-url-of-mp3-when-it-is-playing/58518391#58518391","title":"How to get URL of mp3 when it is playing"}],"owner":{"reputation":754,"user_id":10731042,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9lvV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DIlshod K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10731042/dilshod-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":5082285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6346341a24fb90f9ac3fb4ef1136d564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Markus Kauppinen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5082285/markus-kauppinen"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":293,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":6,"bounty_amount":100,"bounty_closes_date":1571887037,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571818743,"creation_date":1571076717,"last_edit_date":1571125029,"question_id":58382049,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382049","body_markdown":"We can play mp3 files from browsers, Social Networks, Apps...

recently trying to solve this coding challenge from a company and I was stumped.\r\n\r\nLet T(n) denote the number of different ways that a value of n cents, where n &gt;= 4 and n is even, can be made by using 4-cent and 6-cent coins. For example, if n = 12 then we can use 3 4-cent coins or 2 6-cent coins, so T(12) = 2. Write a recursive algorithm in Python to find T(n) for n &gt;= 4 and n is even. \r\n\r\nI nailed down the base cases to be T(n &lt; 4 or n not even) = 0, T(4) = 1 distinct way (1 4-cent coin) and T(6) = 1 distinct way (1 6-cent coin). But I&#39;m not entirely sure how to proceed with a value greater than 6 and is even.

having trouble formulating this problem, and it is perhaps best explained through code.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m writing a query that only returns rows that has a specific priority. For each row it returns with that priority, it should also run a new query, but with a different priority this time (the second query may not return any rows). The final result is the combined results from both queries.\r\n\r\nSo, the code I have now looks like this:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT I.ItemNumber, I.FromLocation, I.ToLocation\r\nFROM ItemLocation AS I\r\nINNER JOIN Delivery AS D\r\n    ON I.ItemNumber = D.ItemNumber\r\n    AND I.FromLocation = D.FromLocation\r\n    AND I.ToLocation = D.ToLocation\r\nWHERE I.Priority IN (&#39;A&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)\r\n    AND D.DeliveryStart &gt; 20191001\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this query is that I only want the ItemNumbers with priority ```&#39;C&#39;``` *if* there were any ItemNumbers with priority ```&#39;A&#39;```. Now I get all of them regardless. And If ```&#39;A&#39;``` *doesn&#39;t* return any rows, it should do the same query, but replace Priority ```&#39;A&#39;``` with ```&#39;B&#39;```, so that the new (but still erroneous) ```WHERE``` clause will be:\r\n```\r\nWHERE I.Priority IN (&#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried handling this logic in code, but this approach will require multiple queries, which unfortunately reduces the performance dramatically.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of doing this *in* the SQL query?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382029/sql-query-that-runs-a-new-sql-query-for-the-same-row-based-on-a-return-condition","title":"SQL query that runs a new SQL query for the same row based on a return condition"},{"tags":["python"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Z1vA_AtmjsI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reP6BRk4vhC-rcXbOxnD4u4k2WgwA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mokrah ghaly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216219/mokrah-ghaly"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571076592,"creation_date":1571076592,"question_id":58382027,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382027","body_markdown":"how to stimulate Etch sketch on gfxhat to draw , i have to Use the function getchar and Write a function displayObject with the folowing signature: displayObject(obj,x,y)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382027/how-to-stimulate-etch-sketch-on-gfxhat","title":"how to stimulate Etch sketch on gfxhat?"},{"tags":["mysql","xml","jdbc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15510,"user_id":27905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f54c977d97a90429c73f3323dc59532a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nitind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/27905/nitind"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571077254,"post_id":58382022,"comment_id":103112474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382022/jdbc-connectivity-with-mysql-timezone-error#comment103112474_58382022"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11949906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a2cb06bda4d6028eb49b1e0b623a2e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patil_Vinod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11949906/patil-vinod"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15510,"user_id":27905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f54c977d97a90429c73f3323dc59532a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nitind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/27905/nitind"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571079778,"post_id":58382022,"comment_id":103113429,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382022/jdbc-connectivity-with-mysql-timezone-error#comment103113429_58382022"},{"owner":{"reputation":15510,"user_id":27905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f54c977d97a90429c73f3323dc59532a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nitind","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/27905/nitind"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571111695,"post_id":58382022,"comment_id":103121229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382022/jdbc-connectivity-with-mysql-timezone-error#comment103121229_58382022"},{"owner":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571145836,"post_id":58382022,"comment_id":103137071,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382022/jdbc-connectivity-with-mysql-timezone-error#comment103137071_58382022"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11949906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a2cb06bda4d6028eb49b1e0b623a2e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patil_Vinod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11949906/patil-vinod"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571145986,"creation_date":1571076560,"last_edit_date":1571145986,"question_id":58382022,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382022","body_markdown":"I am creating student tracker project using JSP as server side technology and MySQL database as backend.

The transitions consist on a first overlay and then a fade-in. For this, I am using Animsition and Fullpage.js. \r\nThe problem is that it works fine on Edge. Moreover, sometimes the flash screen doesn&#39;t appear.\r\n\r\n###What I have tried###\r\nI first though it was a problem because I was working on my local documents. When I switched to a local server then it was working perfectly. However, when I uploaded the website then I saw that the flash screen was still there.\r\n\r\n - **Animsition - Fullpage compatibility** : I checked if it was a problem of compatibility with fullpage.js. I made some test, and both libraries work perfectly together.\r\n - **Multiple transitions** : since I use one transition for the out animation and another one for the fade in, I thought there was some mistakes or wrong interactions between these two. And it may be the case: when I **only add the fade in, I don&#39;t have a flash screen** during the transition. But when I put the overlay-slide-out animation in addition, I see a white flash. So the mistakes should be in this part, but I truly don&#39;t know where. I followed the tutorial from animsition.js.\r\n - **Adding a removeClass** at the end of the javascript function, as detailed on some other post. But it did not worked:\r\n\r\n        .one(&#39;animsition.inStart&#39;,function(){\r\n              $(&#39;body&#39;).removeClass(&#39;bg-init&#39;);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\n#EDIT#\r\nI did not properly fixed it, but I &quot;colored&quot; the white flash with the color of the overlay, with:`.animsition-overlay-slide {background-color: #000;}` and it works fine now.\r\n\r\n\r\n###My code###\r\nBy clicking on the arrows (images on my local folder) at the left of the screen (under this is a test...), the overlay should appear and the transition start.

i click that stack other page when its open, and i want to implement a callback to update the page if a specific button is pressed inside this second page.

I need to update the Home page when i got back after clicking the button, but not when i go to another pages, so a Listener is annoying, since its reload the page after every interaction.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382018/how-to-implement-a-callback-through-a-component","title":"How to implement a callback through a component"},{"tags":["java","springlayout"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":10274001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5-gTg0zEugs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/MxGZF-3oGCQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Austin Yeager","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10274001/austin-yeager"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571077900,"post_id":58382143,"comment_id":103112719,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382013/issue-setting-constraints-on-a-jbutton-from-a-panel-array/58382143#comment103112719_58382143"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":11799366,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1dc17ec682148477193a73e11ca0ea7b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LethalLadders","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799366/lethalladders"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571077248,"creation_date":1571077248,"answer_id":58382143,"question_id":58382013,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382143","body_markdown":"According to Java&#39;s SpringLayout references (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/layout/spring.html) \r\n\r\nIt appears that you *might* be missing the west/east and north/south constraints. \r\n\r\n&gt;Unlike many layout managers, SpringLayout does not automatically set the location of the components it manages.

You preallocate you final output variable with hard coded values:\r\n\r\n    pan_mat_2 = zeros(2359,4126);\r\n\r\nBut later you populate it in a loop which run `for i = 1:length`.\r\n\r\n`length` is the full number of lines picked from the file. In your example file there are only `784` lines. So even if all your line were valid (ok to be parsed), you would only ever fill the first `784` lines of the total `2359` lines you allocated in your `pan_mat_2`. In practice, this file has only 400 valid data lines, so your `pan_mat_2` could definitely be smaller.\r\n\r\nI know you couldn&#39;t know you had only 400 line parsed before you parsed them, but you knew from the beginning that you had only `784` line to parse (you had the info in the variable `length`).

So I quote it here to help future people: \r\n\r\n&gt; In simpler terms, when a raw type is used, the constructors, instance\r\n&gt; methods and non-static fields are also erased.\r\n\r\nP/S: read that question if you want a detail about how raw type work in all case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382006/do-java-remove-all-type-parameters-including-non-generic-type-parameters-from","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Do Java remove all type parameters (including non generic type parameters) from a class If I use the raw type of that class?"},{"tags":["node.js","google-cloud-functions","getstream-io"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9512,"user_id":460417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a381152cd980d15f58e0016c996ab254?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tommaso Barbugli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/460417/tommaso-barbugli"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571669105,"creation_date":1571669105,"answer_id":58488776,"question_id":58382003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58488776","body_markdown":"If you use reactions server-side you must include the user_id as well when you call reactions.add\r\n\r\nThis is the signature of `reactions.add`\r\n\r\n      add: function(\r\n        kind,\r\n        activity,\r\n        data = {},\r\n        { id, targetFeeds = [], userId, targetFeedsExtraData } = {},\r\n        callback,\r\n      ) \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382003/set-the-actor-of-a-reaction-in-getstream/58488776#58488776","title":"Set the actor of a reaction in GetStream"}],"owner":{"reputation":178,"user_id":572646,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71f1e059a7c05ac88683c4279f74b7ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martin Petts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/572646/martin-petts"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58488776,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571669105,"creation_date":1571076479,"question_id":58382003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382003","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Google Firebase Cloud Functions to add a reaction to my Stream activity when a user comments. \r\n\r\nThe docs say you add a reaction this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet comment = await client.reactions.add(&quot;comment&quot;, activityId, {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;awesome post!&quot;});\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t see here how to set the actor of the reaction, i.e. the person writing the comment. \r\n\r\nI see from the docs that I can set a target feed, i.e. the author of the original post or someone mentioned in the comment, but again, this doesn&#39;t set the person writing the comment:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclient.reactions.add(&quot;comment&quot;, activityId, \r\n    {&quot;text&quot;: &quot;@thierry great post!&quot;},\r\n   {targetFeeds:  [&quot;notification:thierry&quot;]}\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nN.B.

is not because of `splice()`. It&#39;s because of the way you add to the arrays after you have removed elements. You do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbox_content[custom_box_id] = &quot;Content of box with id &quot;+custom_box_id;\r\n```\r\n`custom_box_id` increments every time you create a new box. If you create boxes `0`, `1`, and `2`, the array contains\r\n\r\n```\r\nbox_content[0] = &quot;Contents of box with id 0&quot;\r\nbox_content[1] = &quot;Contents of box with id 1&quot;\r\nbox_content[2] = &quot;Contents of box with id 2&quot;\r\n```\r\nand `custom_box_id` is now `3`.\r\n\r\nIf you delete box 1, the array now contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbox_content[0] = &quot;Contents of box with id 0&quot;\r\nbox_content[1] = &quot;Contents of box with id 2&quot;\r\n```\r\nNotice that the array indexes no longer match the IDs in the contents.\r\n\r\nWhen you add the next box, you now have\r\n```\r\nbox_content[0] = &quot;Contents of box with id 0&quot;\r\nbox_content[1] = &quot;Contents of box with id 2&quot;\r\nbox_content[3] = &quot;Contents of box with id 3&quot;\r\n```\r\nNotice that there&#39;s no `box_content[2]`, because `custom_box_id` was `3`. When you view the entire array, this missing element is shown as `undefined`.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want these gaps, you should use `push()` to add to the array rather than assigning to a specific index. You do this for the `custom_boxes_exist` array, but not `custom_boxes_order` and `box_contents`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381996/after-removing-elements-with-splice-there-is-undefined-stuff/58382930#58382930","title":"After removing elements with splice, there is undefined stuff"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":5372316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jgq5NWtqmNQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAB4/k8-1QymfjDU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"shelly 1337","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5372316/shelly-1337"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39537,"user_id":1264804,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bZO24.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"isherwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1264804/isherwood"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571082241,"creation_date":1571076437,"last_edit_date":1571082241,"question_id":58381996,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381996","body_markdown":"So I want to remove array elements by using `splice`\r\n\r\n  \tcustom_boxes_exist.splice($.inArray(id, custom_boxes_exist),1);\r\n\tcustom_boxes_order.splice($.inArray(id, custom_boxes_order),1);\r\n\tbox_content.splice($.inArray(id, box_content),1);\r\n\r\nWhen in output the array content after using splice I&#39;m getting this output:\r\n\r\n    Array(5) [ &quot;Content of box with id 0&quot;, undefined, undefined, undefined, &quot;Content of box with id 4&quot;

and I can&#39;t seem to wrap my head around how to abstract a reactive database so that I can easily swap them out in the future.\r\n\r\nYou need a common abstraction that represents the latest value of multiple event emissions.\r\n\r\nPotential candidates are `io.reactivex.Observable&lt;T&gt;` or `LiveData&lt;T&gt;`.\r\n\r\n&gt; The current target database is Realm, and it&#39;s tempting to simply reference them in my DAO classes, which communicates with my repository classes. \r\n\r\nIt&#39;s tempting until you realize that a `Realm` instance is thread-local and reference-counted, so if you do that, you won&#39;t be able to know when to close the Realm (unless you pass `Realm` to each of your `dao.find*(` methods, or create a `ThreadLocal&lt;Realm&gt;` yourself manually so you can keep track of when to close it.)\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; In this case, it&#39;ll be more or less forwarding Realm&#39;s inputs and outputs. However, I can see where I might try to make a **standard sqlite database reactive**.\r\n\r\nWhile Room and SqlDelight provide support for that, you can look around in [this repo of mine](https://github.com/Zhuinden/simple-stack/blob/master/simple-stack-example-mvvm-fragments/src/main/java/com/zhuinden/simplestackexamplemvvm/core/database/DatabaseManager.java#L225-L269) for how you can create a simple wrapper over SQLite yourself.\r\n\r\n&gt; But before I go down this path, I was wondering if there were better alternatives from people who do have experience in this subject.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make Realm &quot;independent of being Realm&quot; and available for observing without relying on its lazy-evaluation, you can put Realm on a background looper thread (`HandlerThread`) from which you map out the items when you detect change.\r\n\r\nThese RealmResults on this background looper thread must be kept in a Set to keep strong reference to them in order to retain the ability to listen for changes.\r\n\r\nIf you stop observing ALL the RealmResults you&#39;ve opened, then you potentially want to close the Realm automatically.\r\n\r\nWhile I don&#39;t really touch the project anymore, you can look at [Realm-Monarchy](https://github.com/Zhuinden/realm-monarchy) (by me) which does exactly what I mentioned above: wrap RealmResults into a `LiveData&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;` so that it can be swapped out with anything else (including for example `Room`). You can dabble in its source code if you like.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381994/ways-to-create-a-layer-of-abstraction-on-top-of-a-reactive-database/58455510#58455510","title":"Ways to create a layer of abstraction on top of a reactive database?"}],"owner":{"reputation":732,"user_id":1164937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70d5a73393d4d374e50da45db2df7646?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1164937","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1164937/user1164937"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3005,"user_id":1996639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYXbh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1996639/zella"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571419182,"creation_date":1571076435,"last_edit_date":1571244454,"question_id":58381994,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381994","body_markdown":"I&#39;m fairly new to reactive programming, and I can&#39;t seem to wrap my head around how to abstract a reactive database so that I can easily swap them out in the future. \r\n\r\nThe current target database is Realm, and it&#39;s tempting to simply reference them in my DAO classes, which communicates with my repository classes.

However, I can see where I might try to make a standard sqlite database reactive.\r\n\r\nBut before I go down this path, I was wondering if there were better alternatives from people who do have experience in this subject.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381994/ways-to-create-a-layer-of-abstraction-on-top-of-a-reactive-database","title":"Ways to create a layer of abstraction on top of a reactive database?"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","spring-cloud-feign","feign"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12115828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9f4150af1165a56164be94216e81ef5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thain&#225;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115828/thain%c3%a1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571148751,"post_id":58383959,"comment_id":103138913,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381993/spring-restapi-with-feign-client-and-pageable/58383959#comment103138913_58383959"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":9896802,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xazBh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"karim.chtourou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9896802/karim-chtourou"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571086629,"creation_date":1571086629,"answer_id":58383959,"question_id":58381993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58383959","body_markdown":"You can use Resource or Resources provided by spring HATEOAS.\r\nyou need to add spring HATEOAS dependency on your client side : \r\n\r\n    compile(&#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-hateoas&#39;)\r\n\r\nEnable Spring Boot’s Hypermedia Support in your main class:\r\n\r\n    @EnableHypermediaSupport(type = EnableHypermediaSupport.HypermediaType.HAL)\r\n\r\nand change your feign client:\r\n\r\n    @FeignClient(url=&quot;http://localhost:8080/cargos&quot;,name=&quot;cargo&quot;)\r\n    public interface CargoFeign {\r\n    //BUSCA TODOS\r\n    @GetMapping\r\n    Resources&lt;Cargo&gt; consultar(Pageable paginacao);\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381993/spring-restapi-with-feign-client-and-pageable/58383959#58383959","title":"Spring RestAPI with Feign Client and Pageable"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12115828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9f4150af1165a56164be94216e81ef5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thain&#225;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115828/thain%c3%a1"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149326,"creation_date":1571149326,"answer_id":58396880,"question_id":58381993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396880","body_markdown":"Just to clarify, this answear helped a little\r\n\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56021307/spring-data-pageable-not-supported-as-requestparam-in-feign-client][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56021307/spring-data-pageable-not-supported-as-requestparam-in-feign-client\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is how my feign client looks now\r\n\r\n    //BUSCA TODOS\r\n    \t@GetMapping(&quot;/pagina/{paginaAtual}/tamanho/{tamanho}&quot;)\r\n    \tPage&lt;Cargo&gt; findAll(@PathVariable(&quot;paginaAtual&quot;) Integer paginaAtual, @PathVariable(&quot;tamanho&quot;) Integer tamanho);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381993/spring-restapi-with-feign-client-and-pageable/58396880#58396880","title":"Spring RestAPI with Feign Client and Pageable"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12115828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9f4150af1165a56164be94216e81ef5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thain&#225;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115828/thain%c3%a1"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58383959,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571149326,"creation_date":1571076428,"question_id":58381993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381993","body_markdown":"I have a working API with all the CRUD methods i need, but i also have a Feign Client, that is throwing me and exception when my pageable GET method is called.

This ends up being a problem because it&#39;s not possible to load them all up front since I can&#39;t know which ones will be used... otherwise I have to upload everything. The problem is that some people do not have good PCs and have been complaining that loading all the images to the GPU takes a long time for them due to bad hardware.\r\n\r\nMy work around for the latter group was to upload textures just as is needed, and this worked for the most part. The problem is that during the application, there are times where delays occur when a series of images need to be uploaded and there&#39;s a delay due to the uploading. \r\n\r\nI was researching how to get around this, and I have an idea: Users want a smooth experience and are okay if the textures are not immediately loaded but instead are absent. This makes it easy, as I can upload in the background and then just draw nothing for where the object should be, and then bring it into existence after it is done. This is acceptable because the uploads are usually pretty fast anyways, but they&#39;re slow enough that it causes it to dip under 60 fps for some people which causes some stutter. On average it causes anywhere from 1-3 frames of stutter so the uploads do resolve fast and on average less than 50ms.\r\n\r\nMy solution was to attempt something using a PBO to get some async-like uploading. Problem is I cannot find online how I can tell when the uploading is done. Is there a way to do this?\r\n\r\nI figure there are four options:\r\n\r\n1. There&#39;s a way to do what I want with OpenGL 3.1 onwards and that will be that\r\n2.

I have a total of 100 patients that I need to randomize and I want to know what is the chance of a greater than 55%-45% split (i.e. 45 or fewer subjects will be assigned one of the treatments and 55 or more on the other treatment)?

If he responds, then next patient gets assigned to B; otherwise to A.\r\n\r\nIf split is greater than 55-45% then count as 1; otherwise 0.

edited the functions now and passed the values to the functions which I didn&#39;t pass before in the above code, so now the only error I&#39;m getting is handleRequest not defined. should I declare handleRequest somewhere? \r\n\r\n```\r\nLine 60:   &#39;handleRequest&#39; is not defined       no-undef\r\nLine 62:   &#39;handleRequest&#39; is not defined       no-undef\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdae: I have added this.handlerequest.bind(this) so it&#39;s not showing errors anymore. the binding was right, i hope. can someone verify it\r\n\r\n```\r\n handlePost = postId =&gt; {\r\n if (postId == null) {\r\n      return this.handleRequest(&quot;/api/savepost&quot;).bind(this);\r\n    }\r\n    return this.handleRequest(&quot;/api/updatepost&quot;).bind(this);\r\n

specifics, it&#39;s nearly impossible to give valid advice. However, Liquibase creates an entry in the change log table in your database for each &#39;change&#39; that it executes. It computes a checksum for each of these comprised of values which are pertinent to each change. If you ever modify any of your changes, the computed checksum will no longer be the same, and won&#39;t match the one stored in your database, and Liquibase will then try and execute the &#39;updated&#39; change. If you can get away NOT making changes to your prior liquibase changesets, I&#39;d recommend that approach. However, if you must make changes, you may be able to use specify [preconditions](http://www.liquibase.org/documentation/preconditions.html) that would prevent the sort of errors you&#39;re describing.

In Java you cannot [monkey-patch][1] existing code.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, Java wasn&#39;t born as a functional language, so while considerable for  function references was added in Java 8, they&#39;re still not first class citizens. So you cannot assign a new value to a method of a class like you can with a field of that class.\r\n\r\nHowever, since you can assign values to fields, you could do something like this:\r\n\r\n\tclass TestClass3 {\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic Supplier&lt;TestClass3&gt; hello;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic TestClass3() {\r\n\t\t\tthis.hello = this::hello;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic TestClass3 hello() {\r\n\t\t\tTestClass3 t = new TestClass3();\r\n\t\t\treturn t;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tclass TestClass1 {\r\n\t\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\t\tTestClass3 obj = new TestClass3();\r\n\t\t\tobj.hello.get(); // calls hello()\r\n\t\t\tobj.hello = null; // now works\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nHere I define a member named `hello` in `TestClass3`. It&#39;s of type `Supplier&lt;TestClass3&gt;`, and it just so happens that `public TestClass3 hello()` is of the same type. Hence, in the constructor of `TestClass3` I can do this: `this.hello = this::hello;`.\r\n\r\nNow we have a reference to `hello()` as a **field**, which means that we can invoke the function using that field, or even change the field&#39;s value:\r\n\r\n    obj.hello.get();\r\n    obj.hello = null;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5626193/what-is-monkey-patching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381939/why-cannot-i-assign-a-value-to-the-object-reference-being-returned-by-a-method/58382127#58382127","title":"Why cannot I assign a value to the object reference being returned by a method?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12093573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934308b1cd71055c0567ac9d346518b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Do Van Tuan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093573/do-van-tuan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12093573,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/934308b1cd71055c0567ac9d346518b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Do Van Tuan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093573/do-van-tuan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571081938,"last_edit_date":1571081938,"creation_date":1571080655,"answer_id":58382855,"question_id":58381939,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382855","body_markdown":"*obj.hello()* is an **object&#39;s behavior**, not a reference, only reference can be set to null.\r\n\r\n&gt;About null:\r\n\r\n - ***null*** is just a **reference value**.\r\n - reference is a variable that has a name and can be used to **access an object** by referring to the memory address where it is located.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; About Object:\r\n\r\nAll objects have three essential features:\r\n\r\n - state \r\n - **behavior**\r\n - identity\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381939/why-cannot-i-assign-a-value-to-the-object-reference-being-returned-by-a-method/58382855#58382855","title":"Why cannot I assign a value to the object reference being returned by a method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11450043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EvtGPSAaLoY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAKZA/gvD9HOEFf_w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11450043/raj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19339,"user_id":7294647,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QFLgL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jacob G.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7294647/jacob-g"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571084579,"creation_date":1571076142,"last_edit_date":1571076249,"question_id":58381939,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381939","body_markdown":"I have a function which returns a reference to an object.

think this code is fine.\r\n\r\nThe salient aspect of `consteval` is [\\[expr.const\\]/12](http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.const#12):\r\n\r\n&gt; An expression or conversion is in an _immediate function context_ if it is potentially evaluated and its innermost non-block scope is a function parameter scope of an immediate function. An expression or conversion is an _immediate invocation_ if it is an explicit or implicit invocation of an immediate function and is not in an immediate function context. An immediate invocation shall be a constant expression. \r\n\r\nIn \r\n\r\n    void test() {\r\n        A a;\r\n        a = f(); // &lt;-- here\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`f()` is an _immediate invocation_ (it is an explicit invocation of an immediate function that is not in an immediate function context). So the requirement is that `f()` has to be a constant expression. \r\n\r\nNote: just `f()`, not `a = f();`, there is no requirement that the assignment operator here is a constant expression.\r\n\r\nEverything that `f()` invokes is perfectly fine. All of `A`&#39;s special member functions are invocable during constant evaluation time. The result of `f()` is a permitted result of a constant expression ([\\[expr.const\\]/10](http://eel.is/c++draft/expr.const#10)) likewise because it does not trigger any of the restrictions there either (`A` has no pointer or reference members, so trivially none of them refer to objects without static storage duration).\r\n\r\nUltimately, the question of constant evaluation boils down to going through all the list of restrictions and seeing if anything breaks. I don&#39;t think we violate any of the rules, so this should be fine.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381924/consteval-function-returing-object-with-non-trivial-constexpr-destructor/58382152#58382152","title":"consteval function returing object with non-trivial constexpr destructor"}],"owner":{"reputation":2454,"user_id":9691656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6944dacfe20c1ae8aa3cf5131b2cde3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tyker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9691656/tyker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2454,"user_id":9691656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6944dacfe20c1ae8aa3cf5131b2cde3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tyker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9691656/tyker"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":104,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58382152,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571077272,"creation_date":1571076088,"last_edit_date":1571076913,"question_id":58381924,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381924","body_markdown":"C++20 will have the new [consteval][1] keyword and [constexpr destructor][2] if all goes well.\r\nsadly no compiler that i know of implements [consteval][1] at this time.\r\nwill the following code be valid. \r\n\r\n    struct A {\r\n      constexpr ~A() {}\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    consteval A f() {\r\n        return A{};\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void test() {\r\n        A a;\r\n        a = f();

What I would like to represent is the change of how many titles have been read per Gender per year, i.e., I would like to produce a table that tells me how many of the titles read in 2018 were by Women, how many were by men etc. \r\n\r\nedit: \r\n\r\nA desired output would like something like this:\r\n\r\n    Year Woman.Number Gender.Man.Number\r\n    2019 3            4\r\n    2018 3            4\r\n    2017 1            3\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381914/summarizing-development-of-variable-over-time","title":"summarizing development of variable over time"},{"tags":["swift","realm","backup","restore","migrate"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21878,"user_id":2851937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ba23104bce4326d92a60be7fd42d38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851937/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571080328,"post_id":58381910,"comment_id":103113640,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381910/swift-realm-backup-and-restore-the-realm-data#comment103113640_58381910"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11675647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f724679dbafdd24d6438865ba7c0c61?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dev guru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11675647/dev-guru"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21878,"user_id":2851937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ba23104bce4326d92a60be7fd42d38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851937/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571086733,"post_id":58381910,"comment_id":103116026,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381910/swift-realm-backup-and-restore-the-realm-data#comment103116026_58381910"},{"owner":{"reputation":21878,"user_id":2851937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ba23104bce4326d92a60be7fd42d38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851937/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571148811,"post_id":58381910,"comment_id":103138957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381910/swift-realm-backup-and-restore-the-realm-data#comment103138957_58381910"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11675647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f724679dbafdd24d6438865ba7c0c61?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dev guru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11675647/dev-guru"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21878,"user_id":2851937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ba23104bce4326d92a60be7fd42d38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851937/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571162123,"post_id":58381910,"comment_id":103145669,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381910/swift-realm-backup-and-restore-the-realm-data#comment103145669_58381910"},{"owner":{"reputation":21878,"user_id":2851937,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ba23104bce4326d92a60be7fd42d38d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2851937/jay"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571162719,"post_id":58381910,"comment_id":103145928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381910/swift-realm-backup-and-restore-the-realm-data#comment103145928_58381910"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11675647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1f724679dbafdd24d6438865ba7c0c61?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dev guru","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11675647/dev-guru"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571075996,"creation_date":1571075996,"question_id":58381910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381910","body_markdown":"I am currently creating two functions that backup the realm file on backup URL and restore it when required.\r\n\r\nThis is for the purpose of preventing loss data while using the app with the Realm.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    Backup URL: .../user1-server-backup.realm\r\n    Restore URL: .../user1-server.realm\r\n\r\n - The backup function does copy the realm file on restore URL to the\r\n   backup URL. \r\n   \r\n - And restore function migrates the realm file on backup URL    to the\r\n   restore URL.\r\n\r\nI already made a backup function using the writeCopy function.\r\n\r\n    class func backupLocalStore(storeBackupDirectoryURL: URL) -&gt;

I&#39;d like this to have some default values, though I wouldn&#39;t mind configuring it.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381881/docker-readily-available-image","title":"Docker: readily available image"},{"tags":["c#","performance","excel-interop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5134722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4Iv8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Colm Bhandal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5134722/colm-bhandal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571076919,"post_id":58381876,"comment_id":103112346,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381876/performant-check-if-sheet-is-error-free-in-c-interop#comment103112346_58381876"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5134722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4Iv8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Colm Bhandal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5134722/colm-bhandal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571158958,"creation_date":1571158958,"answer_id":58399522,"question_id":58381876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58399522","body_markdown":"It turns out that the performance statistics from the OP&#39;s question were wrong. They were recorded running in debug mode. So the real answer to this question is: don&#39;t do your perf testing in debug mode. Duh. There must be some huge cost to exception handling when in debug mode, though we noticed vast differences on my machine to my teammate&#39;s machine, so maybe it&#39;s some local debug settings of mine. I&#39;m sure others would be able to comment more on this.\r\n\r\nThe *true* performance of the SpecialCells function was 4ms on average, when running outside of debug mode. This was perfectly acceptable for our use case. However, we had already refactored our code by the time this was discovered, and in fact got a further performance increase...\r\n\r\n## Silver Lining\r\n\r\nIn the end, we went with a hybrid solution. If the sheet in question had more than 200_000 cells, we just used the SpecialCells callout, costing 4ms on average. But if the sheet had less than this number of cells, we read in the entire used range and iterated through all its cells, checking for error types by looking at the values, in a similar vein to Mike Rosenblum&#39;s answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2424718/how-to-know-if-a-cell-has-an-error-in-the-formula-in-c-sharp. The cost of looping through those &lt; 200_000 cells, on average, for us, slightly cheaper than doing the callout to SpecialCells. It brought our average down from 4ms to 3ms. Modest, but a speedup nonetheless.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381876/performant-check-if-sheet-is-error-free-in-c-interop/58399522#58399522","title":"Performant Check if Sheet is Error Free in C# Interop"}],"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5134722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4Iv8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Colm Bhandal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5134722/colm-bhandal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":534,"user_id":5134722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/O4Iv8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Colm Bhandal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5134722/colm-bhandal"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571158958,"creation_date":1571075822,"last_edit_date":1571129586,"question_id":58381876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381876","body_markdown":"We have a need for finding formula errors in a large workbook of about 3 million cells. Performance is critical. We have implemented a wrapper function around special cells that allows us to catch an exception in the case of no error cells being found on that worksheet. Similar to:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/3022157/handling-no-cells-were-found-error-in-excel/3022561#3022561\r\n\r\nBut the problem is the check becomes painfully slow when the COM Exception is thrown. More concretely, when there is even one error on a worksheet, we&#39;ve recorded execution times of between 1 and 4ms. When the error is thrown we&#39;re looking at around 80ms.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any creative fast alternative to checking for the non-existence of errors?\r\n\r\n**Our code:**\r\n\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n      dynamic cellsWithErrors = cells.SpecialCells(cellType, valueType);\r\n      return cellsWithErrors;\r\n    }\r\n    catch (COMException)\r\n    {\r\n      return null;\r\n    }         \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n - The finding of errors when they exist is fine so no need to focus on that.\r\n\r\n - I already found a moderate speedup by using dynamic types instead of Range types\r\n\r\n - Our check iterates through all sheets in the entire workbook. So we&#39;d be happy for any solution that&#39;s workbook wide too, but doubt it exists.\r\n\r\n - We&#39;re writing this as part of a VSTO AddIn and using the Interop layer.\r\n\r\n**Solutions Already Considered**\r\n\r\nWe could read in the entire range as values and iterate through it, but was hoping to see if there is something else. Because in the case where there are errors this will be slower.\r\n\r\n**Current Idea**\r\n\r\nSo the conundrum boils down to this. On the one hand, SpecialCells is exceptionally fast when it does find results. But the throwing of the exception can lead to a factor of between 20 and 80 of a slowdown. On the other hand, reading the entire used range of a sheet is pretty consistent in terms of performance: I&#39;d say it&#39;s linear in the number of cells with a small once off constant downpayment. Now, by inspecting cell values it may be possible to find errors, using Mike Rosenblum&#39;s answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2424718/how-to-know-if-a-cell-has-an-error-in-the-formula-in-c-sharp. If so, then we&#39;d have an alternative way to check errors.\r\n\r\nThe idea then is to write a master function that pivots on the size of the sheet in question. If it&#39;s a very large sheet (we have one with around 2 million cells I think), then we might as well just use SpecialCells and accept the cost of an exception if it occurs. But for smaller sheets, where the cost of an exception outweighs the cost of reading in the entire range and iterating through it in memory, then we should just do the latter.\r\n\r\nThe key thing we&#39;d need to determine for that approach is what the crossing point is: where does SpecialCells begin to outperform read &amp; iterate? We may also want to use our own knowledge of our workbook to heuristically guess which sheets are likely to have errors and which aren&#39;t. I&#39;ll post an answer if we develop one and I have time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381876/performant-check-if-sheet-is-error-free-in-c-interop","title":"Performant Check if Sheet is Error Free in C# Interop"},{"tags":["c#"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":635,"user_id":384936,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5044d0567cc7ae2e52cbd511958e2c15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"junkone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/384936/junkone"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571076282,"creation_date":1571076282,"answer_id":58381966,"question_id":58381875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58381966","body_markdown":"fixed it by using the following\r\n AllTrades = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;List&lt;QuickTradeObject&gt;&gt;(jsonString); ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381875/cannot-implicitly-convert-type-ninjatrader-ninjascript-indicators-quicktradeobj/58381966#58381966","title":"Cannot implicitly convert type &#39;NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Indicators.QuickTradeObject&#39; How do i fix it"}],"owner":{"reputation":635,"user_id":384936,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5044d0567cc7ae2e52cbd511958e2c15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"junkone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/384936/junkone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571076282,"creation_date":1571075820,"question_id":58381875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381875","body_markdown":"I have declared my list as below\r\n\r\n     private List&lt;QuickTradeObject&gt; AllTrades = new List&lt;QuickTradeObject&gt;();\r\n\r\nWhen i am deserializing my json, i get a cast error. how do i fix it?\r\n\r\n    using(StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(filename))\r\n    {\r\n         string jsonString = reader.ReadToEnd();\r\n       AllTrades = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;QuickTradeObject&gt;(jsonString); \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNinjaScript File\tError\tCode\tLine\tColumn\r\nPlotTrades.cs\tCannot implicitly convert type &#39;NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Indicators.QuickTradeObject&#39; to &#39;System.Collections.Generic.List&lt;NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.Indicators.QuickTradeObject&gt;&#39;\tCS0029\t72\t16\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #region Using declarations\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n    using System.ComponentModel;\r\n    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\r\n    using System.Linq;\r\n    using System.Text;\r\n    using System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n    using System.Windows;\r\n    using System.Windows.Input;\r\n    using System.Windows.Media;\r\n    using System.Xml.Serialization;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Cbi;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Gui;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Gui.Chart;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Gui.SuperDom;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Gui.Tools;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Data;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.NinjaScript;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.Core.FloatingPoint;\r\n    using NinjaTrader.NinjaScript.DrawingTools;\r\n    #endregion\r\n    using Newtonsoft.Json;\r\n    using System.IO;\r\n\r\n    //This namespace holds Indicators in this folder and is required.

My interpretation of my metrics was pretty much correct but my conclusion was not.\r\n\r\nApparently, these metrics (and Personalize in general) *do not take into account how much a user likes an item*. Personalize only cares how soon a relevant recommendation gets to the user. This makes sense because if you get the 25th item in a queue and don&#39;t like anything you&#39;ve seen, you are not likely to continue looking.\r\n\r\nGiven this, what&#39;s happening in my solution is that the first-ish recommendation is relevant but none of the others are.\r\n\r\n**Detailed Answer from AWS**\r\n\r\n&gt;I will start with relatively easier question first: What are the ideal values for these metrics, so that a solution version can be preferred over another solution version?\r\nThe answer to the above question is that for each metric, higher numbers are better. [1] If you have more than one solution version, please prefer the solution version with higher values for these metrics. Please note that you can create number of solution versions by Overriding Default Recipe Parameters [2]. And by using Hyperparameters [3].\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The second question: How to understand and interpret the metrics for AWS Personalize Solution version?\r\n&gt;I can confirm from my research that the definitions and interpretation provided for these metrics in the case by you are valid. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Before I explain each metric, here is a primer for one of the main concept in Machine Learning. How these metrics are calculated?\r\n&gt;The Model training step during the creation of solution version splits the input dataset into two parts, a training dataset (~70%) and test dataset (~30%). The training dataset is used during the Model training. Once the model is trained, it is used to predict the values for test dataset. Once the prediction is made it is validated against the known (and correct) value in the test dataset. [4]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;I researched further to find more resources to understand the concept behind these metrics and also elaborate further an example provided in the AWS documentation. [1] \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;&quot;mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;Let’s first understand Reciprocal Rank:\r\n&gt;For example, a movie streaming service uses a solution version to predict a list of 5 recommended movies for a specific user i.e A, B, C, D, E. \r\n&gt;Once these 5 recommended movies are compared against the actual movies liked by that user (in the test dataset) we find out that only movie B and E are actually liked by the user.\r\n&gt;The Reciprocal Rank will only consider the first relevant (correct according to test dataset) recommendation which is movie B located at rank 2 and it will ignore the movie E located at rank 5. Thus the Reciprocal Rank will be 1/2 = 0.5\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Now let’s expand the above example to understand Mean Reciprocal Rank: [5] Let’s assume that we ran predictions for three users and below movies were recommended.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;User 1: A, B, C, D, E (user liked B and E, thus the Reciprocal Rank is 1/2)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;User 2: F, G, H, I, J (user liked H and I, thus the Reciprocal Rank is 1/3)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;User 3: K, L, M, N, O (user liked K, M and N, thus the Reciprocal Rank is 1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;The Mean Reciprocal Rank will be sum of all the individual Reciprocal Ranks divided by the total number of queries ran for predictions, which is 3.\r\n&gt;(1/2 + 1/3 + 1)/3 = (0.5+0.33+1)/3 = (1.83)/3 = 0.61\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;In case of AWS Personalize Solution version metrics, the mean of the reciprocal ranks of the first relevant recommendation out of the top 25 recommendations over all queries is called “mean_reciprocal_rank_at_25”.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;&quot;precision_at_K&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;It can be stated as the capability of a model for delivering the relevant elements with the least amount of recommendations.\r\n&gt;The concept of precision is described in the following free video available at Coursera. [6] A very good article on the same topic can be found here. [7]\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Let’s consider the same example, a movie streaming service uses a solution version to predict a list of 5 recommended movies for a specific user i.e; A, B, C, D, E. Once these 5 recommended movies are compared against the actual movies liked by that user (correct values in the test dataset) we find out that only movie B and E are actually liked by the user.\r\n&gt;The precision_at_5 will be 2 correctly predicted movies out of total 5 movies and can be stated as 2/5=0.4\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;&quot;normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;This metric use the concept of Logarithm and Logarithmic Scale to assign weighting factor to relevant items (correct values in the test dataset). The full description of Logarithm and Logarithmic Scale is beyond the scope of this document. The main objective of using Logarithmic scale is to reduce wide-ranging quantities to tiny scopes.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;Let’s consider the same example, a movie streaming service uses a solution version to predict a list of 5 recommended movies for a specific user i.e; A, B, C, D, E. Once these 5 recommended movies are compared against the actual movies liked by that user (correct values in the test dataset) we find out that only movie B and E are actually liked by the user.\r\n&gt;Let’s consider the same example, a movie streaming service uses a solution version to predict a list of 5 recommended movies for a specific user i.e; A, B, C, D, E. Once these 5 recommended movies are compared against the actual movies liked by that user (correct values in the test dataset) we find out that only movie B and E are actually liked by the user.\r\n&gt;To produce the cumulative discounted gain (DCG) at 5, each relevant item is assigned a weighting factor (using Logarithmic Scale) based on its position in the top 5 recommendations. The value produced by this formula is called as “discounted value”.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;The formula is 1/log(1 + position)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;As B is at position 2 so the discounted value is = 1/log(1 + 2)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;As E is at position 5 so the discounted value is = 1/log(1 + 5)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;The cumulative discounted gain (DCG) is calculated by adding discounted values for both relevant items DCG = (  1/log(1 + 2) + 1/log(1 + 5)  )\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;normalized_discounted_cumulative_gain_at_K&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;First of all, what is “ideal DCG”?\r\n&gt;In the above example the ideal predictions should look like B, E, A, C, D. Thus the relevant items should be at number 1 and 2 in ideal case. To produce the “ideal DCG” at 5, each relevant item is assigned a weighting factor (using Logarithmic Scale) based on its position in the top 5 recommendations. The value produced by this formula is called as “discounted value”.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;    The formula is 1/log(1 + position).&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;    As B is at position 1 so the discounted value is = 1/log(1 + 1)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;    As E is at position 2 so the discounted value is = 1/log(1 + 2)&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;The ideal DCG is calculated by adding discounted values for both relevant items DCG = (  1/log(1 + 1)   +   1/log(1 + 2)  )\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;The normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG) is the DCG divided by the “ideal DCG”. \r\n&gt;DCG / ideal DCG = (1/log(1 + 2) + 1/log(1 + 5))  /  (1/log(1 + 1) + 1/log(1 + 2)) = 0.6241\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;I hope the information provided above is helpful in understanding the concept behind these metrics.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;[1] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/working-with-training-metrics.html&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[2] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/customizing-solution-config.html&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[3] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/personalize/latest/dg/customizing-solution-config-hpo.html&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[4] https://medium.com/@m_n_malaeb/recall-and-precision-at-k-for-recommender-systems-618483226c54&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[5] https://www.blabladata.com/2014/10/26/evaluating-recommender-systems/&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[6] https://www.coursera.org/lecture/ml-foundations/optimal-recommenders-4EQc2&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt;[7] https://medium.com/@bond.kirill.alexandrovich/precision-and-recall-in-recommender-systems-and-some-metrics-stuff-ca2ad385c5f8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381854/how-to-interpret-solution-metrics-in-aws-personalize/58455340#58455340","title":"How to interpret solution metrics in AWS Personalize?"}],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":11842860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NuaGp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"starrywrites","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11842860/starrywrites"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41,"user_id":11842860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NuaGp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"starrywrites","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11842860/starrywrites"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58455340,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571418409,"creation_date":1571075729,"last_edit_date":1571238230,"question_id":58381854,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381854","body_markdown":"Can someone help me interpret the AWS Personalize solution version metrics in layman’s terms or, at the very least, tell me what these metrics should ideally look like?\r\n\r\nI have no knowledge of Machine Learning and wanted to take advantage of Personalize as it is marketed as a &#39;no-previous-knowledge-required&#39; ML SaaS.

From reading, this is my interpretation of each metric:&lt;br&gt;\r\nNDG = Consistency of relevance of recommendations; Is the first recommendation as relevant as the last?&lt;br&gt;\r\nPrecision = Relevance of recommendations to user; How relevant are your recommendations to users across the board?&lt;br&gt;\r\nMRR = Relevance of first recommendation in the list versus the others in the list; How relevant is your first recommendation to each user?&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nIf these interpretations are right, then my solution metrics indicate that I am highly consistent about recommending irrelevant content.

The init-declarator-list appearing in a declaration is a comma-separated sequence of declarators, each of which can have an initializer.\r\n&gt; &lt;pre&gt;\r\ninit-declarator-list:\r\n\tinit-declarator\r\n\tinit-declarator-list , init-declarator\r\ninit-declarator:\r\n\tdeclarator initializer&lt;sub&gt;opt&lt;/sub&gt;\r\n\tdeclarator requires-clause\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; [4][2] The optional requires-clause ([temp]) in an init-declarator or member-declarator shall not be present when the declarator does not declare a function ([dcl.fct]). When present after a declarator, the requires-clause is called the trailing requires-clause. The trailing requires-clause introduces the constraint-expression that results from interpreting its constraint-logical-or-expression as a constraint-expression. [ Example:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     void f1(int a) requires true;               // OK\r\n&gt;     auto f2(int a) -&gt; bool requires true;       // OK\r\n&gt;     auto f3(int a) requires true -&gt; bool;       // error: requires-clause precedes trailing-return-type\r\n&gt;     void (*pf)() requires true;                 // error: constraint on a variable\r\n&gt;     void g(int (*)() requires true);            // error: constraint on a parameter-declaration\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     auto* p = new void(*)(char) requires true;  // error: not a function declaration\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;— end example ]\r\n\r\nAs those two paragraphs specify, a trailing requires clause can appear at the end of function declarators. Its meaning is to constrain the function by the constant expression it accepts as an argument (which includes concepts).\r\n\r\n[1]: http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.decl#1\r\n[2]: http://eel.is/c++draft/dcl.decl#4\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381851/disable-non-templated-methods-with-concepts/58381934#58381934","title":"Disable non-templated methods with concepts"}],"owner":{"reputation":39172,"user_id":2805305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/442d249754d1725d9510cf06fa46b964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805305/bolov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58381852,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571076335,"creation_date":1571075710,"question_id":58381851,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381851","body_markdown":"Is there a syntax to constraint a non-templated method?
