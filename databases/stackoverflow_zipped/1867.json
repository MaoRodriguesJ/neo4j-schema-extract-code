I guess I need to make myself a bit clearer, sorry.\r\nI DO NOT have problem with the app it self. it runs single or multiple instances just fine. we have mechanism built in to prevent cross-instance interference, file/record blocking etc..\r\n\r\nthe issue is that sometimes  when running several instances, (some one go and click on myapp.exe several times manually ) one or more instances can crush. \r\nbe it from a bad data in the file, loss db connection, what ever. I am still trying to figure out some of the unexplained crushes and hanged instances sources.\r\n\r\nwhat I am looking for is a way for me to setup a monitoring process that \r\nA. can identify each instance of the app running  as separate entity. \r\nB. check if that one instance is running and not hanged / crushed , this maybe mediated but me changing the code and force the app to quit if a fatal error is detected, as in I crushed and can not recover I quit, kind of setup. \r\nC. start new additional instances up to the total count of desired instances running. that is I want to have a minimal count or app running at the same time. if current count is less start up new until desired count is reached. \r\n\r\nwhat would be the best approach to have this setup. \r\n\r\n\r\n**************************************\r\nI have a custom inhouse application written on C++ and C# mixed API. \r\nit is a file processing parser for EDI process, that takes data from flat files or Flat file representation from a DB table (we have other modules that store a contents of flat file in DB varchar field) and process and store data in appropriate DB tables. \r\nit works fine for the most part, but several clients have a need to run multiple instances of it to speed up the process. \r\n\r\nproblem is that when the app crashes, there is no automatic way I know  to identify the instance that crashed , shut it down and restart.\r\n\r\nneed help to identify my options here. \r\nhow can I run the same EXE multiple time yet monitor and manage each in the event of instance misbehaving. \r\n\r\na code change is possible but C++ is not my main language so it will be a nightmare for me to do any extensive changes.\r\n\r\nPS&gt;  the app is a mix of C++ and C# modules with MSSQL DB backend\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nthe process is monitored with MSSQL SPs. an issue can be identified by luck of new records processed and other factors\r\n\r\nmy needs are to be able to \r\n1. start several instances of an app at the same time.\r\n2. monitor each instance of running EXE and if crush is detected kill and restart that one instance.  I have a kill switch in the app that can shut it down gracefully, but need a way to monitor and restart it. but only that one.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097649/runing-and-monitoring-several-instances-of-a-custom-c-c-application-automatic","title":"Runing and monitoring several instances of a custom C++/C# application automatically, possible?"},{"tags":["spring","flux","reactor"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1199856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b8b4ac6c5e9a6a24f7b953138e5cd98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amitoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1199856/amitoj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569416071,"post_id":58098392,"comment_id":102589626,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097645/how-to-process-a-csv-file-using-reactor-flux-and-output-as-json/58098392#comment102589626_58098392"},{"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":8636516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b4db0993772924fd3c4ee0a74b88d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"harkesh kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8636516/harkesh-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1199856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b8b4ac6c5e9a6a24f7b953138e5cd98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amitoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1199856/amitoj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569416253,"post_id":58098392,"comment_id":102589733,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097645/how-to-process-a-csv-file-using-reactor-flux-and-output-as-json/58098392#comment102589733_58098392"},{"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":8636516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b4db0993772924fd3c4ee0a74b88d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"harkesh kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8636516/harkesh-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":120,"user_id":1199856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b8b4ac6c5e9a6a24f7b953138e5cd98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amitoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1199856/amitoj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569416286,"post_id":58098392,"comment_id":102589753,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097645/how-to-process-a-csv-file-using-reactor-flux-and-output-as-json/58098392#comment102589753_58098392"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":435,"user_id":8636516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b4db0993772924fd3c4ee0a74b88d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"harkesh kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8636516/harkesh-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":435,"user_id":8636516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b4db0993772924fd3c4ee0a74b88d0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"harkesh kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8636516/harkesh-kumar"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569417231,"last_edit_date":1569417231,"creation_date":1569414483,"answer_id":58098392,"question_id":58097645,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58098392","body_markdown":"Add Two class like \r\n\r\n    public class TopJson {\r\n    \tprivate int Id;\r\n    \tprivate String name;\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate InnerJson data;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic TopJson() {}\r\n    \tpublic TopJson(int id, String name, InnerJson data) {\r\n    \t\tsuper();\r\n    \t\tId = id;\r\n    \t\tthis.name = name;\r\n    \t\tthis.data = data;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class InnerJson{\r\n    \t\r\n    \tprivate String group;\r\n    \tprivate String status;\r\n    \tpublic InnerJson() {}\r\n    \tpublic InnerJson(String group, String status) {\r\n    \t\tsuper();\r\n    \t\tthis.group = group;\r\n    \t\tthis.status = status;\r\n    \t}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***converted to appropriate types and used to create the object.***\r\n\r\n\r\n    fluxOfCsvRecords.skip(1)\r\n    \t  .map((Function&lt;String, TopJson&gt;) x -&gt;

I looked at cv2.normalize(), but it did not look like I could provide my own sets of input and output values. So I also tried using the following adding the clipping to be sure there were no over-flows or under-flows: \r\n\r\n    aa = a*2.0 - 255.0\r\n    aa[aa&lt;0] = 0\r\n    aa[aa&gt;0] = 255\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nwhere I computed that from solving simultaneous equations such that in=255 becomes out=255 and in=127.5 becomes out=0 and doing a linear stretch between:\r\n\r\n    C = A*X+B\r\n    255 = A*255+B\r\n    0 = A*127.5+B\r\n    Thus A=2 and B=-127.5\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nBut that does not work nearly as well as skimage rescale_intensity.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Rnmd.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/kyemj.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097626/how-can-i-soften-just-the-edges-of-this-image/58107596#58107596","title":"How can I soften just the edges of this image"}],"owner":{"reputation":909,"user_id":654242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab5db4fd5aa890b87c1da50cac3ca17f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SpeedOfSpin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/654242/speedofspin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":909,"user_id":654242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab5db4fd5aa890b87c1da50cac3ca17f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SpeedOfSpin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/654242/speedofspin"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58107596,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569597109,"creation_date":1569411948,"last_edit_date":1569597109,"question_id":58097626,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58097626","body_markdown":"I am using python and opencv to cut an image using a mask.

For instance, the Unit of measure is related to the domain `MEINS`, which has the routine `CUNIT` which corresponds to the function modules `CONVERSION_EXIT_CUNIT_INPUT` and `CONVERSION_EXIT_CUNIT_OUTPUT`.\r\n\r\n- `CONVERSION_EXIT_CUNIT_INPUT` does the conversion from the external value (displayed) to the internal value (program and database)\r\n- `CONVERSION_EXIT_CUNIT_OUTPUT` does the conversion from the internal value (program and database) to the external value (displayed)\r\n\r\nThese function modules are automatically called in SAP rendering technologies like SAP GUI, SAPscript, Smart Form, SAP Adobe form, BSP, Web Dynpro, etc. The &quot;OUTPUT&quot; function module is also called if you call the ABAP statement [`WRITE`](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_753_index_htm/7.53/en-US/index.htm?file=abapwrite-.htm).\r\n\r\nNote that the &quot;output length&quot; defined for a DDIC domain may be of some importance, because one may define an output length (displayed) larger than the internal length. For instance, the language code is stored internally on one character but displayed on two characters. For instance, in English, the language code &quot;V&quot; (Sweden) is displayed &quot;SW&quot; (Sweden), and the language code &quot;S&quot; (Spain) is displayed &quot;SP&quot; (Spain).\r\n\r\nFinally, if you understand well the concept, you should conclude that you usually don&#39;t need to convert anything yourself. It can be useful only if you want to define an interface which is not one of the SAP supported technologies mentioned above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097610/do-i-need-to-convert-a-value/58102970#58102970","title":"Do I need to convert a value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":10680318,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a5fc849a4d0be78205489b1f1c058fd8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Snoopy111","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10680318/snoopy111"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5591,"user_id":9150270,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07e89ef7ec2f93f949e76081bd9d1749?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sandra Rossi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9150270/sandra-rossi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58102970,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570001071,"creation_date":1569411878,"last_edit_date":1569427772,"question_id":58097610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58097610","body_markdown":"While I was selecting a unit from a database table I noticed, via transaction `SE16N`, that there are two different values for the same field.

Sorry if this is a really simple answer, but, I am not that great at css.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097585/how-to-create-a-circle-around-ordered-li-elements","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"how to create a circle around ordered &lt;li&gt; elements"},{"tags":["vba","outlook","attachment","mt940"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12118730,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xskiOrwNfzg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rezSCOiXJGDqdIdi9FNcnvniUTpcg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raj Das","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12118730/raj-das"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569494679,"post_id":58103577,"comment_id":102619346,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097583/how-do-i-rename-and-add-the-received-date-to-my-attachment-downloaded-from-outlo/58103577#comment102619346_58103577"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":10776519,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af66cb6f734bfbc5b7771b2f915a2ee9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10776519/mike"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569431935,"creation_date":1569431935,"answer_id":58103577,"question_id":58097583,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58103577","body_markdown":"Updated your code below to append the date BEFORE the display file name.

Do I make an RTP frame with 1 MP3 frame, 2, or how many?**\r\n\r\nRTP has a one-to-one mapping from one unique source to one RTP stream (Unless the streams are mixed/muxed together into one stream) so each of the MP3 sources would be put into their own RTP stream, each with it&#39;s own unique Synchronization Source Identifier (SSRC) to differentiate between each stream.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info on RTP there&#39;s [the RFC 3550 itself][1], there&#39;s a great book by Colin Perkins called &quot;[RTP: Audio and Video for the Internet][2]&quot;, [I&#39;vea fair bit on RTP on my blog][3] and I&#39;ve also created a [Python library for creating RTP packets.][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3550\r\n  [2]: https://books.google.com.au/books?id=OM7YJAy9_m8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=RTP:%20Audio%20and%20Video%20for%20the%20Internet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJkOWl2PfkAhVQKa0KHQaOC_QQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=RTP%3A%20Audio%20and%20Video%20for%20the%20Internet&amp;f=false\r\n  [3]: https://nickvsnetworking.com/rtp-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/\r\n  [4]: https://nickvsnetworking.com/pyrtp-simple-rtp-library-for-python/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097580/rtp-packet-maximum-size/58161511#58161511","title":"RTP Packet maximum size?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7753851,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TI8qmQ0PQSk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABEo/lSz3_FwFJOo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"M.

But then again that&#39;s half of the job done if it get&#39;s fixed since I want the `&quot;%value%&quot;` and not just the `value` of the table.\r\n\r\nNow I searched online for a way to do this and I found people saying that it can&#39;t be done and then some workarounds with combinations of `LIKE` and `IN` where people said it will be very slow if one of the tables grows to have tons of data(my case).  \r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to do this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097559/how-to-compare-value-with-multiple-modified-values-from-another-table-in-bigquer","title":"How to compare value with multiple modified values from another table in BigQuery?"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d","debugging","dll","hololens"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":11167142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4Hpun.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chrisfromwork","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11167142/chrisfromwork"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569863028,"post_id":58111601,"comment_id":102725516,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097558/how-to-capture-std-output-of-dll-in-unity-uwp-app/58111601#comment102725516_58111601"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":246,"user_id":11502506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c4d63c94b274420f3643f7c8e770cdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hernando - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11502506/hernando-msft"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569482806,"creation_date":1569482806,"answer_id":58111601,"question_id":58097558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58111601","body_markdown":"Do you mean to print debug log in the console from CPP DLL?\r\n\r\nYou can write a callback function in C# that takes a string as it&#39;s argument and print it into the Unity&#39;s console window, and then pass a pointer of this function to C++ dll, so you can call the function from C++ by it&#39;s pointer, this will redirect your strings from C++ to log window.

You can also write data to multiple outputs.\r\n\r\nFor more details, refer &quot;[Query examples for common Stream Analytics usage patterns][2]&quot;.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/stream-analytics-query/stream-analytics-query-language-reference\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-stream-analytics-query-patterns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097539/execute-azure-steaming-analytics-queries-from-a-python-script/58111125#58111125","title":"Execute Azure steaming analytics queries from a python script"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10207312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e-bQt7fYxyY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7q_-r10cOCPUGGyUuimHHAZsPuWOQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Gaborel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10207312/nicolas-gaborel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569491768,"post_id":58111330,"comment_id":102617818,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097539/execute-azure-steaming-analytics-queries-from-a-python-script/58111330#comment102617818_58111330"},{"owner":{"reputation":9494,"user_id":10185816,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10340dd65e2812dfbc21386874e9535c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ivan Yang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10185816/ivan-yang"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10207312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e-bQt7fYxyY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7q_-r10cOCPUGGyUuimHHAZsPuWOQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Gaborel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10207312/nicolas-gaborel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569547104,"post_id":58111330,"comment_id":102640963,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097539/execute-azure-steaming-analytics-queries-from-a-python-script/58111330#comment102640963_58111330"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9494,"user_id":10185816,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10340dd65e2812dfbc21386874e9535c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ivan Yang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10185816/ivan-yang"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569481798,"creation_date":1569481798,"answer_id":58111330,"question_id":58097539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58111330","body_markdown":"There is no python sdk for azure stream analytics.\r\n\r\nIf you have to use python, you can try to use python call [related powershell script][1] for your purpose. \r\n\r\n[Here][2] is an example of how to use python call powershell.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/stream-analytics/stream-analytics-quick-create-powershell#define-the-transformation-query\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21944895/running-powershell-script-within-python-script-how-to-make-python-print-the-pow?answertab=active#tab-top","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097539/execute-azure-steaming-analytics-queries-from-a-python-script/58111330#58111330","title":"Execute Azure steaming analytics queries from a python script"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10207312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-e-bQt7fYxyY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7q_-r10cOCPUGGyUuimHHAZsPuWOQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Gaborel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10207312/nicolas-gaborel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58111330,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569481798,"creation_date":1569411601,"question_id":58097539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58097539","body_markdown":"The `azure-eventhub (1.3.2)` lib for python only allows users to send and consume messages from Azure EventHub. \r\n&gt;Use the Event Hubs client library for Python to:\r\n\r\n&gt; - Publish events to the Event Hubs service through a sender.\r\n\r\n&gt; - Read events from the Event Hubs service through a receiver.\r\n\r\nFor conception and debugging purposes, I tried using the querying console available on the Azure portal but the experience was... unproductive (multiple crashes, reloads, etc.).

There is a wrong and a right way to do this. The wrong way is very easy to understand, so I will show it so it makes sense...\r\n\r\n    select id, type, value from table where id in (select id from table where type=&#39;length&#39;);\r\n\r\nThat obviously gets the type/value combination from every id that has a value for type=&#39;length&#39;. But, you aren&#39;t doing it ALL in the database. You still have to sort and group everything outside the database. Let&#39;s assume you only have type=&#39;length&#39;, &#39;weight&#39; and &#39;price&#39;. I can create three tables on the fly for that, creating attributes of length, weight, and price...\r\n\r\n    select l.id, length, weight, price from\r\n    (select id, value as length from table where type=&#39;length&#39;) l\r\n    left outer join\r\n    (select id, value as weight from table where type=&#39;weight&#39;) w\r\n    on l.id=w.id\r\n    left outer join\r\n    (select id, value as price from table where type=&#39;price&#39;) p\r\n    on l.id=p.id\r\n    order by length\r\n\r\nNow, you will get each attribute in a row, one row per id. The id field is not guaranteed to be unique here. If you have the same ID with more than one length, it will show up more than once in the results. But, I hope you can see how I took the obvious subquery and turned it into a join to do all the work inside the database.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I fixed the ambiguity error and added &quot;left outer&quot; to include rows where weight and price do not exist.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097536/fetch-extra-data-for-large-number-of-ids/58097774#58097774","title":"Fetch extra data for large number of IDs"}],"owner":{"reputation":1146,"user_id":955823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/126372dfab11aa374e84ee512855edb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"binoculars","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/955823/binoculars"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1146,"user_id":955823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/126372dfab11aa374e84ee512855edb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"binoculars","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/955823/binoculars"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58097774,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569423310,"creation_date":1569411591,"last_edit_date":1569413809,"question_id":58097536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58097536","body_markdown":"I have a MySQL table containing information about objects.

This take too much time, probably because it needs to go through the while loop and execute a statement for every found ID.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m looking for a way to reduce the execution time getting this data.

I have also tried shuffling the in chunks and then try stacking the chunks to build the full array, but `MemoryError`. The only solution I have found till now is loading the file in `mmap_mode = &#39;r+&#39;` and then doing `np.random.shuffle`.

Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\nYour starting (absolute) XPath:\r\n\r\n`&#39;/hierarchy/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.LinearLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.LinearLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.widget.ScrollView/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.widget.TextView&#39;`\r\n\r\nYour new relative XPath:\r\n\r\n`//android.widget.ScrollView//android.widget.TextView`\r\n\r\nYou can also mix absolute and relative XPath, like this:\r\n\r\n`//android.widget.ScrollView/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.widget.TextView&#39;`\r\n\r\nWithout a complete page source, I cannot guarantee this XPath will work. The `//` notation means the following element will be located anywhere on the page. This means if you have more than one `android.widget.ScrollView` element on the page, `//android.widget.ScrollView` will return multiple web elements.\r\n\r\nThis also means if `android.widget.ScrollView` has more than one `android.widget.TextView` element under it, `//android.widget.ScrollView//android.widget.TextView` will locate multiple `TextView` elements.\r\n\r\nYou can add conditions in brackets such as `android.widget.ScrollView[@class=&#39;someClass&#39;]//android.widget.TextView` to make your paths more accurate.\r\n\r\nIf you post a more complete page source, I can help you write better XPaths and understand the notation here.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097519/i-can-not-understand-the-syntax-that-how-to-define-xpath-in-typerscript-language/58102193#58102193","title":"i can not understand the syntax that how to define xpath in typerscript language"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12118720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/358fb3824039a167b076fb4082fb3134?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12118720/sid"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9012,"user_id":3689450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NfVJ4.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VLAZ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689450/vlaz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569426434,"creation_date":1569411550,"last_edit_date":1569411619,"question_id":58097519,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58097519","body_markdown":"```typescript\r\nconsole.log(client.findElement(xpath,&#39;/hierarchy/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.LinearLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.LinearLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.widget.FrameLayout/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.widget.ScrollView/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.view.ViewGroup[1]/android.widget.TextView&#39;));\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097519/i-can-not-understand-the-syntax-that-how-to-define-xpath-in-typerscript-language","title":"i can not understand the syntax that how to define xpath in typerscript language"},{"tags":["python","while-loop","user-input"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":511,"user_id":6352008,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7we30.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Plopp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6352008/plopp"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569411813,"post_id":58097517,"comment_id":102587115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58097517/create-a-while-loop-that-gets-input-from-user-and-checks-for-negative-values#comment102587115_58097517"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":40545,"user_id":2390182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKx5r.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"schwobaseggl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2390182/schwobaseggl"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569411893,"creation_date":1569411893,"answer_id":58097614,"question_id":58097517,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58097614","body_markdown":"What you want to do is:\r\n\r\n    while ABmatka &lt;
