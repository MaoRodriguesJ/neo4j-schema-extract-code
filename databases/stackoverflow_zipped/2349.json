So in described case your view is created twice and onViewCreated called twice. You need to stop requesting your data if fragment instance is destroyed (this is what happened when you call replace) because now you will have a memory leak. To do network request right you need to have some object which haven&#39;t\r\nconnected with fragment/activity lifecycle rotation re-creation etc. You may start your network call and listen for result from some other retained instance fragment for example. This code have a lot of problems, so start from learning more about managing fragment, and fragment retained instance. Good solution will be start using google arch components ViewModel.

As a first step, I would like to simulate a simple vector ODE: dx/dt = A*x, where A is a matrix and x is a vector. All the ODE examples I have seen for GEKKO have been for scalar ODEs and the array example from the online [documentation](https://gekko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html) doesn&#39;t show how to incorporate the .dt() method when declaring an Equation. I know that when declaring equations, lists can be used, so I thought something like this would be the way to go:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom gekko import GEKKO\r\nm=GEKKO()\r\nm.time=np.linspace(0.,1.,10)\r\nN=5\r\nA=np.ones([N,N])\r\nx=np.ones(N)\r\nx=m.Var(value=x)\r\nA=m.Param(value=A)\r\nfor i in range(N):\r\n    for j in range(N):\r\n        m.Equation(x[i].dt() += A[i][j] * x[j])\r\n\r\nm.options.IMODE=4\r\nm.solve()\r\n```\r\nbut this code will fail for two reasons: 1) += isn&#39;t a valid comparison for the Equation method, and 2) python complains that x[i].dt() is not a valid attribute of x[i] (which is a np.float64).

Now all libs are not good behaving and some may crash. So obviously this &quot;scanning&quot; operation cannot continue on the main thread. I need a way to gracefully terminate and report an exception when a thread crashes scanning a particular library and restart that thread. I will be using Qt with C++.\r\nNow these libraries are at various locations in the system and for speeding up this scanning task, I spawn multiple threads for that purpose. Now I want to make it like all the &quot;scanner&quot; threads report to a common thread/process about the files they will be scanning and each thread will be aware what the other is scanning so double checking will not occur. I will also need to unload the libraries which are finished with to save RAM as these libraries can often be in 100s of MB. I also do not want to use file-locking for that purpose as other software could be accessing that library.\r\nRemember I want to keep this cross platform. I read in Boost&#39;s DLL library docs that on MacOS, from a single process multiple threads cannot be accessing dlopen_/dlclose_.

You handle each package separately as it was an individual, self-contained package.  \r\n\r\nThe advantage of a monorepo lays not in sharing files through the directory structure but in:\r\n\r\n1. Bootstrapping all dependencies to a single `node_modules` with flat structure, effectively deduplicating them.\r\n2. Making your packages available to your other packages through regular package `import`/`require()` as they were external dependencies. And, thanks to symlinks to `node_modules`, your &quot;dependency&quot; packages contain always the latest content without publishing.\r\n3. Enforcing consistent, always up-to-date, dependency structure in all your packages. As you said &quot;This also means that each package will have the same dependency&quot;.\r\n4. Automation tools to perform different maintainance tasks (like build, publish) on all your packages with a single command.\r\n\r\nI know it&#39;s not so easy at the beginning, but when you dig into Lerna documentation it&#39;s becoming more clear. Besides Lerna [main page](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) I recommend reading about [hoisting](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/doc/hoist.md), [FAQ](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/blob/master/FAQ.md) and individual commands like [bootstrap](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/bootstrap) and [publish](https://github.com/lerna/lerna/tree/master/commands/publish).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979550/what-is-a-correct-approach-to-a-javascript-monorepo/58107170#58107170","title":"What is a correct approach to a javascript monorepo"}],"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":3056783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4c16T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3056783","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3056783/user3056783"},"last_editor":{"reputation":506,"user_id":3056783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4c16T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3056783","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3056783/user3056783"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":95,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58107170,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570478779,"creation_date":1568742457,"last_edit_date":1570478779,"question_id":57979550,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979550","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to figure out correct approach for a javascript monorepo. Imagine monorepo containing packages / libraries:\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot\r\n  - node_modules\r\n  - packages\r\n      + lib-a\r\n          * node_modules\r\n      + lib-b\r\n          * node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s say both `lib-a` and `lib-b` packages use `webpack` as their build tool.\r\n\r\nI see two approaches\r\n\r\n1. Add `wepback` as dependency to root. Include &quot;build&quot; script in both packages: `&quot;build&quot;: &quot;webpack -p --config webpack.config.js`. `webpack.config.js` could include root `webpack.config.js`. Then I could use tool like `lerna` to run the build from root directory (which means `webpack` binary is recognized. However I will be unable to run the build in specific packages since `webpack` is not available there. I could probably change the build script to something like `&quot;build&quot;: &quot;../../node_modules/.bin/webpack -p --config webpack.config.js`\r\n\r\n2. Always include `webpack` in each package. This means that `build` script will succeed.

both `graphiQl` and `fetch()` were working and `axios` was not, I was quick to point fingers at the latter. As it happens `axios` was the only one working properly.\r\nAs @coreyward suggested, there were restrictions on the server side, so that some `User` properties should only be available for query by their user owner, and `username` was not among them.\r\nFor those familiar with Symfony&#39;s API-Platform:\r\n\r\nAs an example, the `email` property was available, as it included the `get-owner` annotation.\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;string&quot;, length=180)\r\n     * @Groups({&quot;post&quot;, &quot;put&quot;, &quot;get-admin&quot;, &quot;get-owner&quot;})\r\n     * @Assert\\NotBlank(groups={&quot;post&quot;})\r\n     * @Assert\\Email(groups={&quot;post&quot;, &quot;put&quot;})\r\n     * @Assert\\Length(min=6, max=180, groups={&quot;post&quot;, &quot;put&quot;})\r\n     */\r\n    private $email;\r\n\r\nBut `username` did not include the `get-owner` group annotation:\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * @ORM\\Column(type=&quot;string&quot;, length=180)\r\n     * @Groups({&quot;post&quot;, &quot;get-ad-with-user&quot;})\r\n     * @Assert\\NotBlank(groups={&quot;post&quot;})\r\n     * @Assert\\Length(min=6, max=50, groups={&quot;post&quot;})\r\n     */\r\n    private $username;\r\n\r\nSo the fix was just to add that annotation to the `username` property as so:\r\n \r\n     * @Groups({&quot;post&quot;, &quot;get-ad-with-user&quot;, &quot;get-owner&quot;})\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me at this time on why did `fetch()` and `graphiQl` were able to fetch the data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979517/axios-graphql-query-throws-internal-server-error-but-fetch-works/58006068#58006068","title":"Axios GraphQl query throws internal server error but fetch() works"}],"owner":{"reputation":595,"user_id":2127381,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56bcc30e0a9a4130a9dc20fb6a34bc1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BernardA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2127381/bernarda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":595,"user_id":2127381,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56bcc30e0a9a4130a9dc20fb6a34bc1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BernardA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2127381/bernarda"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568878893,"creation_date":1568742338,"last_edit_date":1568824188,"question_id":57979517,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979517","body_markdown":"I am struggling to execute my first graphQl query with axios. \r\n\r\nThe app stack is Gatsby on the front-end with Symfony&#39;s API-Platform on the back end.\r\n\r\nI did check a few the other similar questions at SO and blog posts but no luck.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that the query works on graphiQl AND it also works if I attempt to execute with fetch API.\r\n\r\nThis code is within `sagas.js`\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the \r\n\r\n    const api = (data) =&gt;

And how can I forward the request to the Faces Servlet?\r\n\r\nHere is what I was thinking:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: xml --&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;servlet&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-name&gt;Faces Servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-class&gt;javax.faces.webapp.FacesServlet&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n            &lt;load-on-startup&gt;1&lt;/load-on-startup&gt;\r\n        &lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-name&gt;aws&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-class&gt;servlets.aws&lt;/servlet-class&gt;\r\n        &lt;/servlet&gt;\r\n    &lt;!--    &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-name&gt;Faces Servlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.xhtml&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n        &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;--&gt;\r\n        &lt;servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n            &lt;servlet-name&gt;aws&lt;/servlet-name&gt;\r\n            &lt;url-pattern&gt;*.xhtml&lt;/url-pattern&gt;\r\n        &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    protected void processRequest(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)\r\n            throws ServletException, IOException {\r\n        response.setContentType(&quot;text/html;charset=UTF-8&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        System.out.println(&quot;configure DB based on URL&quot;);\r\n        \r\n        RequestDispatcher rd = request.getRequestDispatcher(&quot;FacesServlet&quot;);\r\n        rd.forward(request, response);

I cannot access `answerEt, scoreCounter, answer[i]` because they are not final. They should be final because I am working with an inner class. Here is the problem, if I will make them final, I will not have the ability to modify them. However, `scoreCounter` should be incremented to show the user score. Also the *i* should be incremented to iterate through the `answer[]`. One will say &quot;make them Global&quot;. Sadly, I tried this and my program crashed. So, How I can solve this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979494/accessing-an-array-inside-onkeylistener-inner-class","title":"Accessing an array inside OnKeyListener inner class"},{"tags":["facebook","facebook-graph-api","preview","api-linkpreview"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61978,"user_id":757508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1603196280/picture?type=large","display_name":"luschn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/757508/luschn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568747867,"creation_date":1568747867,"answer_id":57980720,"question_id":57979490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57980720","body_markdown":"You MUST use the Facebook Graph API if you want to get data of Facebook Pages (or anything else on Facebook), scraping is not allowed.\r\n\r\nIn order to get data of Pages you do not own, you need to apply for Page Public Content Access: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/feature/#reference-PAGES_ACCESS\r\n\r\nAn App Access Token (without Login) is sufficient in that case.\r\n\r\nAPI Reference for Pages: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/page/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979490/crawl-public-facebook-posts/57980720#57980720","title":"Crawl Public Facebook Posts"}],"owner":{"reputation":1963,"user_id":560745,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a38aa801877ac66ffa9ad8e7a46aa1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"TCB13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560745/tcb13"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568747867,"creation_date":1568742239,"question_id":57979490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979490","body_markdown":"I made a website where people can post links for other websites and then the backend generates a preview of the link (by using curl and parsing out the open graph tags available on most websites / by picking the first image, html title etc).

Any ideas of how to keep the same idea but make the game run better?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Flashlight:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self.flashlight_surf = pygame.Surface((SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H))\r\n        self.flashlight_surf2 = pygame.Surface((SCREEN_W, SCREEN_H))\r\n\r\n        self.flashlight_surf2.set_colorkey((1,1,1))\r\n        self.flashlight_surf2.set_alpha(200)\r\n        self.flashlight_radius = 200\r\n\r\n    def flashlight_update(self):\r\n        self.flashlight_surf2.fill(black)\r\n\r\n        pygame.draw.circle(self.flashlight_surf2, (1,1,1), (round(player.x) + \r\n        32, round(player.y) + 32), self.flashlight_radius)\r\n\r\n        display.blit(self.flashlight_surf2, (0,0))\r\n        self.flashlight_surf2.blit(self.flashlight_surf, (0,0))\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979458/how-to-fix-lag-in-pygame-when-drawing-multiple-surfaces","title":"How to fix lag in pygame when drawing multiple surfaces"},{"tags":["java","mysql","import","wikipedia","dump"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":461,"user_id":7506662,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCjZj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Top.Deck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7506662/top-deck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569071383,"post_id":58023871,"comment_id":102481705,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979457/importing-wikipedia-dump-to-sql-incomplete/58023871#comment102481705_58023871"},{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1264066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18d19b8e28b697240c9634da10864184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Benjam&#237;n Valero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1264066/benjam%c3%adn-valero"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":461,"user_id":7506662,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCjZj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Top.Deck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7506662/top-deck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569221190,"post_id":58023871,"comment_id":102511119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979457/importing-wikipedia-dump-to-sql-incomplete/58023871#comment102511119_58023871"},{"owner":{"reputation":461,"user_id":7506662,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DCjZj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Top.Deck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7506662/top-deck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569242898,"post_id":58023871,"comment_id":102521954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979457/importing-wikipedia-dump-to-sql-incomplete/58023871#comment102521954_58023871"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":1264066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18d19b8e28b697240c9634da10864184?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Benjam&#237;n Valero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1264066/benjam%c3%adn-valero"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568965054,"creation_date":1568965054,"answer_id":58023871,"question_id":57979457,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023871","body_markdown":"You can find all the Wikipedia (and sibling projects) dumps in:\r\n\r\nhttps://dumps.wikimedia.org/backup-index.html\r\n\r\nIn particular, if you are looking for the English Wikipedia:\r\n\r\nhttps://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/\r\n\r\nThere you can find several dumps according to your needs.

tried training YOLO V3 on a signature dataset, but the trained model after 2000 iterations couldn&#39;t produce any detection. \r\n\r\nThe data set consisted of around 5000 images with signatures on them. The document pages are black and white. The images are labeled accurately as the pages are generated by me by placing signatures on the pages. \r\n\r\nI used the YOLOv3 default architecture, but trained from scratch. I tried using `darknet53.conv.74` and fine tuning it, but it didn&#39;t work, which I assume is because the network is trained on photo data while the data I have are documents. Training from scratch, I trained on a GPU AWS machine for 2000 iterations. During training, the output is like follows:\r\n\r\nIt went from:\r\n\r\n`2: 3249.269043, 3238.557373 avg, 0.000000 rate, 10.226817 seconds, 128 images Loaded: 0.000073 seconds`\r\n\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n`2032: 0.667013, 0.644689 avg, 0.001000 rate, 22.906654 seconds, 130048 images Loaded: 0.000103 seconds`\r\n\r\nSo the training loss has significantly decreased and has been hovering around 0.6 for couple hundred iterations at least. \r\n\r\nThe only part I&#39;m not 100% sure is how to start the training process, and I used the code below to train it. \r\n\r\n```\r\n./darknet detector train params/darknet.data params/darknet-yolov3.cfg\r\n```\r\n\r\n`darknet.data` is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclasses = 1\r\ntrain  = ./params/data_train.txt\r\nvalid  = ./params/data_test.txt\r\nnames = ./params/classes.names\r\nbackup = ./params/weights/\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `darknet-yolov3.cfg` is the exact same as `yolov3.cfg`. \r\n\r\nI tried testing the model using couple different images with signatures on them, and they are rather simple cases. But the trained model failed to detect any signature in all of these test images. \r\n\r\nIf anyone has any suggestions on what I should do to/test, it would be greatly appreciated!

has been giving me some trouble for the past few days.  I&#39;m going to try to be as detailed as possible with what I want and the issue I&#39;m having.  I tried to simplify my controllers, models, etc as much as I can for the sake of the question.\r\n\r\n**Here&#39;s the flow of sequences I&#39;m trying to get to work.**\r\n\r\n 1. Give user a view with inputs for `List&lt;MyObject&gt;` in the main ViewModel\r\n 2. User can hit a button to add another row to add another object to that List of objects to post later\r\n 3. Hitting the button POSTs the object (in same container) through AJAX from the currently displayed list in order to repeat most of the inputs for the new row (`MyObject`)\r\n 4. Controller takes passed `MyObject` and maps some of the prior values to the new object\r\n 5. Controller passes back new `MyObject` and ajax appends the result `html` to my table\r\n\r\n# The Problem #\r\nThe Ajax is passing the on-page `MyObject` as `null` (or C# doesn&#39;t know how to interpret) to my controller (step 4 above).  I can&#39;t seem to get the object passed to the controller through the Ajax call.\r\n\r\n# What I&#39;ve got #\r\n\r\nModels:\r\n\r\n    public class MyViewModel\r\n\t{\r\n\t\t// irrelevant properties\r\n\t\tpublic List&lt;MyObject&gt;

When you write:\r\n\r\n    regClass instance;\r\n\r\nthen the compiler is unable to deduce the `T` type of the embedded template `templClass&lt;T&gt;` class. `templClass` alone by itself is not a complete type.\r\n\r\nTherefore you have two options:\r\n\r\n 1. Specify the type directly inside the `regClass` class definition:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    class regClass\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        regClass()\r\n        {\r\n            // constructor for other members\r\n        }\r\n        int var;\r\n        templClass&lt;int&gt; templClass_;\r\n        // [...]\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nThat way you can write `regClass instance;`, but the embedded object type will always be of type `templClass&lt;int&gt;`.\r\n\r\n 2. Make the external class a templated class:\r\n```\r\n    template &lt;class T&gt;\r\n    class regClass\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        regClass()\r\n        {\r\n            // constructor for other members\r\n        }\r\n        int var;\r\n        templClass&lt;T&gt; templClass_;\r\n        // [...]\r\n    };\r\n```\r\nThis way you can decide the type at the moment of instantiation, e.g. `regClass&lt;std::string&gt; instance;`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979436/how-to-add-template-class-as-member-within-a-normal-class/57980130#57980130","title":"How to add Template class as member within a normal class"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11698639,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4B_yQmG86rI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/R69w5QyjjKw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ajay Charan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11698639/ajay-charan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568745123,"creation_date":1568742010,"question_id":57979436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979436","body_markdown":"I have a template class: `templClass` which takes in a type and works like a regular template class.

**Q** : *how can I interrupt a process that&#39;s carrying out a sequence of actions in a clean way?*\r\n\r\nMay implement a signaling/messaging metaplane, using nanomsg or ZeroMQ, that will smart-inform the process ( which is checking for presence of such a `&lt;NO-GO&gt;`-message, as an example in due places in between the phases of the pure-[SERIAL] workflow check-points )\r\nand once a `&lt;NO-GO&gt;`-message arrives, the process may perform a graceful-cleanup and smart termination of its own run.\r\n\r\nThe add-on costs are minimal.\r\n\r\n    def long_sequential_tasks( idx

MVC-actor-based GUI and any other smart-&quot;sources&quot; of control-messages can live with this concept and initiate smart-signaling/messaging outside the world of the `tk.mainloop()`-scheduler and easily reach inter-platform integrated computing exo-systems ( using this for more than a decade for a remote GUI for a QuantFX prototyping with AI/ML + trading backend ecosystem ).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nAnother way is to implement the exit-plan via a use of a custom-defined signal-handler. This releaves the need to structure the sequence of steps after/before which the exit-plan is being checked in a rather rigid way. Signal handlers can &quot;interrupt&quot; the flow of computations and may (rather brutally) kill its own process (which needs to add some mitigation measures, if graceful terminations are a must), but represents an option, if loooong running workflow-steps are worth stopping upon some external logic, responsible for the exit-plan flagging a `&lt;NO-GO&gt;`-state.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979411/python-multiprocessing-how-to-shutdown-a-long-running-process-that-is-a-sequenc/57979530#57979530","title":"Python multiprocessing: How to shutdown a long running process that is a sequence of actions"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12080895,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBsBXlWRjxjuW4Aa8-gaqM45nEriOacKuXQ3GDjWQ=k-s128","display_name":"Jason Tan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12080895/jason-tan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568767383,"creation_date":1568741878,"question_id":57979411,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57979411","body_markdown":"I want to use multiprocessing to run simultaneously several processes of a series of lengthy actions (e.g. clicking through programs simultaneously using computer vision). I want to implement a stop button in a GUI that would allow me to stop the processes midway - but I&#39;m not sure how I can do something like that.\r\n\r\nI know I can use a shutdown event to control the processes if there&#39;s a loop - however in my case the target function is not a loop. Here&#39;s some code where I basically just did an event check on every line of the target function:\r\n\r\n(I deleted a large part of the tkinter code as it&#39;s not relevant, the start/stop functions are for their respective buttons in the GUI.)\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Event, Process\r\nfrom time import sleep\r\n\r\ndef start_proc(self):\r\n    self.proc_stop_event.clear()\r\n    for i in range(4):\r\n        p = Process(target=long_sequential_tasks, args=(i,self.proc_stop_event))\r\n        p.start()\r\n    \r\ndef stop_proc(self):\r\n    self.proc_stop_event.set()\r\n\r\n#a series of lengthy, different and sequential tasks\r\ndef long_sequential_tasks(idx, event):\r\n    if not event.is_set(): &lt;---\r\n        print(str(idx))\r\n        sleep(10) \r\n    else:\r\n        break\r\n    if not event.is_set(): &lt;---\r\n        print(str(idx * 2))\r\n        sleep(10)\r\n    else:\r\n        break\r\n    if not event.is_set(): &lt;---\r\n        print(str(idx * 3))\r\n        sleep(10)\r\n    else:\r\n        break\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the event status every line is obviously not a solution, but I really don&#39;t know what else I can do. In the future I want to add queues and locks to synchronize the parallel processes, and apparently process.terminate can leave them hanging. \r\n\r\nSo if process.terminate is not an option, how can I interrupt a process that&#39;s carrying out a sequence of actions in a clean way?

{\r\n       const newData = [...data];\r\n       Promise.all(fetchMoreData(newData)).then(el =&gt; {\r\n          // more calculation\r\n          newData.push(el.someValue);\r\n       })\r\n       return newData;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n`return newData` happens before you reach `newData.push(el.someValue)`, and since they reference the same array, that means you&#39;re calling `setState()` and passing an array which is mutated asynchronously, independent of when your component re-renders.\r\n\r\nEssentially, you have created a race-condition that will make your component state indeterminate because it is based on whether the `fetch()` operations complete before or after the React framework decides to re-render the component.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo solve this, there are two options that come to mind, so choose whichever is more readable to you, or consistent with your coding style, but first let&#39;s address a small refactor to make your helper function more canonical.\r\n\r\nAn asynchronous function should prefer to return a promise to an array, not an array of promises:\r\n\r\n    fetchMoreData(arr) {\r\n       const promises = arr.map(el =&gt;\r\n         fetch(someUrl)\r\n           .then(res =&gt; res.json())\r\n       );\r\n\r\n       return Promise.all(promises);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, let&#39;s continue to the two solutions:\r\n\r\n### Nest (and return) the promise chain dependent on the previous scope\r\n\r\n    fetch(url)\r\n      .then(res =&gt; res.json())\r\n      .then(data =&gt; {\r\n        // do some calculations and populate new array and return it\r\n      })\r\n      .then(array =&gt; {\r\n        // nest the promise chain\r\n        return fetchMoreData(array).then(result =&gt; {\r\n          // more calculations dependent on array from previous scope\r\n          result.forEach(el =&gt; {\r\n            array.push(el.someValue);\r\n          });\r\n\r\n          // pass array along\r\n          return array;\r\n        });\r\n      })\r\n      .then(data =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState({ data });\r\n      });\r\n\r\nNotice that we `return fetchMoreData(array).then(...)`, and within the nested continuation, also `return array`. This will allow `array` to be passed along to `data` in the next chain.\r\n\r\n### Pass the dependency from the previous scope through a flattened promise chain\r\n\r\n    fetch(url)\r\n      .then(res =&gt; res.json())\r\n      .then(data =&gt; {\r\n        // do some calculations and populate new array and return it\r\n      })\r\n      .then(array =&gt; {\r\n        const promise = fetchMoreData(array);\r\n        // pass the dependency along\r\n        return Promise.all([array, promise]);\r\n      })\r\n      // destructure dependencies\r\n      .then(([array, result]) =&gt; {\r\n        // more calculations dependent on array from previous scope\r\n        result.forEach(el =&gt; {\r\n          array.push(el.someValue);\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        // pass array along\r\n        return array;\r\n      })\r\n      .then(data =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState({ data });\r\n      });\r\n\r\nHere, we encapsulate the dependency in another `Promise.all()` and pass both the `array` and `promise` along to the next flattened chain, which we then use array destructuring syntax to separate out again in the callback parameter. From there, we perform the additional calculations and then pass the array along to the final chain.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979376/multiple-api-calls-with-fetch-in-chain-and-promise-all/57979710#57979710","title":"Multiple API calls with fetch in chain and Promise.all"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":4190416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b45a2e4c5d3597190cea3fce20e93a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vrt1515","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4190416/vrt1515"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568807561,"post_id":57981152,"comment_id":102391213,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979376/multiple-api-calls-with-fetch-in-chain-and-promise-all/57981152#comment102391213_57981152"},{"owner":{"reputation":25934,"user_id":1243641,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a70aa9d494bf438c8b56aced999e897f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scott Sauyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1243641/scott-sauyet"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":83,"user_id":4190416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b45a2e4c5d3597190cea3fce20e93a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vrt1515","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4190416/vrt1515"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568808324,"post_id":57981152,"comment_id":102391612,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979376/multiple-api-calls-with-fetch-in-chain-and-promise-all/57981152#comment102391612_57981152"},{"owner":{"reputation":25934,"user_id":1243641,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a70aa9d494bf438c8b56aced999e897f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scott Sauyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1243641/scott-sauyet"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":83,"user_id":4190416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b45a2e4c5d3597190cea3fce20e93a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vrt1515","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4190416/vrt1515"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568810817,"post_id":57981152,"comment_id":102393033,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979376/multiple-api-calls-with-fetch-in-chain-and-promise-all/57981152#comment102393033_57981152"},{"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":4190416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b45a2e4c5d3597190cea3fce20e93a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vrt1515","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4190416/vrt1515"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568847086,"post_id":57981152,"comment_id":102408931,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979376/multiple-api-calls-with-fetch-in-chain-and-promise-all/57981152#comment102408931_57981152"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25934,"user_id":1243641,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a70aa9d494bf438c8b56aced999e897f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scott Sauyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1243641/scott-sauyet"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25934,"user_id":1243641,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a70aa9d494bf438c8b56aced999e897f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Scott Sauyet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1243641/scott-sauyet"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568810761,"last_edit_date":1568810761,"creation_date":1568749768,"answer_id":57981152,"question_id":57979376,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57981152","body_markdown":"I think I&#39;m probably missing something you&#39;re trying to do.

Hopefully a simple question, but I want to put a vertical line in my polar coordinates graph that denotes the start of the data. I have a data set that collects hourly readings over the period of a year and I have managed (with help) to get the polar graph I wanted. My data is in the format (x = yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS and y = number value). I have rotated the origin so that the start is not vertical (I need to keep this rotation). So to denote where the data starts and ends over a period of a year, I would like to add in a vertical line (see image below).  \r\n\r\n2.

You need to configure your modem to allow this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979333/how-to-make-a-simple-docker-service-accessible-from-external-hosts/57979871#57979871","title":"How to make a simple docker service accessible from external hosts"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":9086341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f73b4803e6563637f915616b8c60886?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John Student","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9086341/john-student"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568748914,"post_id":57980105,"comment_id":102371068,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57979333/how-to-make-a-simple-docker-service-accessible-from-external-hosts/57980105#comment102371068_57980105"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1543,"user_id":3639630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rPscq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wesgur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3639630/wesgur"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568745033,"creation_date":1568745033,"answer_id":57980105,"question_id":57979333,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57980105","body_markdown":"An alternative could be using tunneling.
