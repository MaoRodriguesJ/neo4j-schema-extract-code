Can you suggest better approach ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231685/predict-user-behavior-if-they-opened-to-another-platform","title":"Predict user behavior if they opened to another platform"},{"tags":["c++","abstract-class","shared-ptr","implementation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":317293,"user_id":440558,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9ZYta.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Some programmer dude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440558/some-programmer-dude"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570173863,"post_id":58231683,"comment_id":102837327,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231683/implementation-of-an-abstract-class-with-a-function-that-returns-a-shared-pointe#comment102837327_58231683"},{"owner":{"reputation":10689,"user_id":7478597,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yBOIj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scheff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7478597/scheff"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570174908,"post_id":58231683,"comment_id":102837762,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231683/implementation-of-an-abstract-class-with-a-function-that-returns-a-shared-pointe#comment102837762_58231683"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7542676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IawI9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"O .

As a result there are a number of version references that are tripping us up when we build the projects on &quot;fresh&quot; dev clients without all the legacy versions rattling around.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n&gt; C:\\Repos\\MyOldProject.csproj(415,3): error MSB4019: The imported project &quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MSBuild\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v11.0\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets&quot; was not found. Confirm that the path in the &lt;Import&gt; declaration is correct, and that the file exists on disk.\r\n\r\nAs you can expect the file indicated does not exist on disk. Looking at the indicated location in the project file, I find this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Import Project=&quot;$(VSToolsPath)\\WebApplications\\Microsoft.WebApplication.targets&quot; Condition=&quot;&#39;$(VSToolsPath)&#39; != &#39;&#39;&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n...And above this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n        &lt;VisualStudioVersion Condition=&quot;&#39;$(VisualStudioVersion)&#39; == &#39;&#39;&quot;&gt;10.0&lt;/VisualStudioVersion&gt;\r\n        &lt;VSToolsPath Condition=&quot;&#39;$(VSToolsPath)&#39; == &#39;&#39;&quot;&gt;$(MSBuildExtensionsPath32)\\Microsoft\\VisualStudio\\v$(VisualStudioVersion)&lt;/VSToolsPath&gt;\r\n    &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n\r\nCuriously, I can&#39;t find any instances of &quot;v11.0&quot; in *any* of my solutions or projects. With the condition statements in play, I cannot for certain say if the `$(VSToolsPath)` has an original value, or if it is cobbled together at this point!\r\n\r\nIs there any way for me to locate the origin of these types of variables?\r\n\r\nIs there a way to have MssBuild.exe output the final value of these variables?\r\n\r\n-S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231677/debugging-msbuild-variables","title":"Debugging MsBuild variables"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","datatables"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":11055696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cApX1Fw-OKw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/n7umGegb4h4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11055696/joe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570181372,"post_id":58232902,"comment_id":102840537,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231675/how-to-get-user-entered-data-and-ids-in-dynamically-added-table-rows/58232902#comment102840537_58232902"},{"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":3143987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf70182ea295ab466210a6f9db15dfc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vipul patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3143987/vipul-patel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":94,"user_id":11055696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-cApX1Fw-OKw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAk/n7umGegb4h4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11055696/joe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570182748,"post_id":58232902,"comment_id":102841251,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231675/how-to-get-user-entered-data-and-ids-in-dynamically-added-table-rows/58232902#comment102841251_58232902"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":3143987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf70182ea295ab466210a6f9db15dfc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vipul patel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3143987/vipul-patel"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570178828,"creation_date":1570178828,"answer_id":58232902,"question_id":58231675,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58232902","body_markdown":"What do you mean by ids?? on what action you would want user data and ids of dynamically created rows.\r\n\r\nEverything is there.

It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion.\r\n\r\nCreate the store:\r\n\r\n```javaScript\r\nconst store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n  state: {\r\n    width: 50\r\n  },\r\n  mutations: {\r\n    setWidth (state, value) {\r\n      state.width = value\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n```\r\n&quot;Inject&quot; the store into all child components from the root component with the store option (enabled by Vue.use(Vuex)):\r\n```\r\nconst app = new Vue({\r\n  el: &#39;#app&#39;,\r\n  // provide the store using the &quot;store&quot; option.\r\n  // this will inject the store instance to all child components.\r\n  store,\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\n\r\n```\r\nBy providing the store option to the root instance, the store will be injected into all child components of the root and will be available on them as `this.$store`. When the width is changed update it by calling mutation method in the methods of your components:\r\n```\r\nthis.$store.commit(&#39;setWidth&#39;, value)\r\n```\r\nTo read the value of the `width` from the store in any method of your vue-components use this:\r\n```\r\nthis.$store.state.width\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231673/pass-the-value-of-a-variable-from-child-component-to-two-parent-components-vuej/58236364#58236364","title":"Pass the value of a variable from child component to two parent components, vuejs? nuxt"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12157724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91617c99549ab1571436aa0cacaaebbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nina Abramova","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157724/nina-abramova"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2447,"user_id":2343305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1kNEA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IlGala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2343305/ilgala"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570191781,"creation_date":1570173605,"last_edit_date":1570190283,"question_id":58231673,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58231673","body_markdown":"How to store the state value of a variable?\r\n\r\nFor example, I have three components: `home.vue` and `map.vue`, as well as a common `sidebar.vue` component, which is used inside `home.vue` and `map.vue`. \r\n\r\nI pass some data from `sidebar.vue` (a variable storing sidebar width state).

I should perhaps add that the PHP I want to add is to be part of a form and as far as I can see needs to be in the same file as the HTML.\r\n\r\nHere is the JS function with Ajax to load content:\r\n\r\n    function loadPage(url)  //the function that loads pages via AJAX\r\n    {   \r\n        url=url.replace(&#39;#page&#39;,&#39;&#39;);    //strip the #page part of the hash and leave only the page number\r\n        \r\n        jQuery(&#39;#loading&#39;).css(&#39;visibility&#39;,&#39;visible&#39;);  //show the rotating gif animation   \r\n        \r\n        jQuery.ajax({    //create an ajax request to load_page.php\r\n            type: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n            url: ajax_object.ajax_url,\r\n            data: {\r\n    \t        action: &#39;ajax_request2&#39;,\r\n    \t        page: url //with the page number as a parameter\r\n    \t    },\r\n    \t    dataType: &quot;html&quot;,   //expect html to be returned\r\n    \t    error: function(xhr, textStatus, textError) { \r\n                console.log(textError);\r\n    \t    },\r\n            success: function(msg) {\r\n    \t        window.alert(&quot;Working loadPage ajax!&quot;);\r\n                if(parseInt(msg)!=0)    //if no errors\r\n                {\r\n                    jQuery(&#39;#pageContent&#39;).html(msg);    //load the returned html into pageContent\r\n                    jQuery(&#39;#loading&#39;).css(&#39;visibility&#39;,&#39;hidden&#39;);   //and hide the rotating gif\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231578/adding-php-to-dynamically-created-div-content","title":"Adding PHP to dynamically created div content"},{"tags":["typescript","typedoc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5165,"user_id":4252741,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3CRt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4252741/chic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570214911,"post_id":58231577,"comment_id":102855778,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231577/customize-theme-breaking-search-functionality-in-typedoc#comment102855778_58231577"},{"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":1787781,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/513vP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anuj Srivastava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1787781/anuj-srivastava"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5165,"user_id":4252741,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3CRt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4252741/chic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570447605,"post_id":58231577,"comment_id":102904351,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231577/customize-theme-breaking-search-functionality-in-typedoc#comment102904351_58231577"},{"owner":{"reputation":5165,"user_id":4252741,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/L3CRt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4252741/chic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570570225,"post_id":58231577,"comment_id":102952497,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231577/customize-theme-breaking-search-functionality-in-typedoc#comment102952497_58231577"}],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":1787781,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/513vP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anuj Srivastava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1787781/anuj-srivastava"},"last_editor":{"reputation":91,"user_id":1787781,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/513vP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anuj Srivastava","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1787781/anuj-srivastava"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570447537,"creation_date":1570173156,"last_edit_date":1570447537,"question_id":58231577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58231577","body_markdown":"When I created own customize theme in typedoc, observed search functionlity is broken.

I am using Robot class to press the character &#39;v&#39; which is not working instead it prints v in output. \r\n\r\nI am using firefox- geckodriver-v0.24.0-win64 driver and my browser version is v69.0.1 .\r\n\r\n```\r\n        List&lt;WebElement&gt; eleq = driver.findElements(By.cssSelector(&quot;.class&quot;));\r\n\t\tJavascriptExecutor js = ((JavascriptExecutor) driver);\r\n\t\tfor(WebElement e: eleq){\r\n\t\t\tjs.executeScript(&quot;arguments[0].scrollIntoView(true);&quot;, e);\r\n\t\t\tActions builder = new Actions(driver);\r\n\t\t\tAction seriesOfActions = builder\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.moveToElement(e)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.build();\r\n\t\t\tseriesOfActions.perform();\r\n\t\t\tRobot robot = new Robot();\r\n\t\t\trobot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V); \r\n\t\t\tThread.sleep(1000);\r\n\t\t\tDate d =new Date();\r\n\t\t\tFile screenshot = ((TakesScreenshot)driver).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);\r\n\t\t\tFileUtils.copyFile(screenshot, new File(d.toString().replace(&quot;:&quot;, &quot;_&quot;)+&quot;.png&quot;));\r\n\t\t\tThread.sleep(3000);\r\n\t\t\trobot.keyPress(KeyEvent.VK_V);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCould like to know if there are any alternatives to keypress in Java selenium apart from Robot since most of my search led to Robot not working in headless.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231557/robot-keypress-not-working-in-headless-mode","title":"Robot keypress not working in headless mode"},{"tags":["android","tensorflow","detection"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":12192957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03050658e2a70f411c90b4e2eb887d06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"karandeep36","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12192957/karandeep36"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570774071,"creation_date":1570774071,"answer_id":58335152,"question_id":58231551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58335152","body_markdown":"Please refer to below example available in Tensorflow site for getting detections from Camera\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/object_detection/android\r\n\r\nThis example shows on how to setup an object detector in Android and get positions of the object detected.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231551/detection-and-get-position-in-tensorflow/58335152#58335152","title":"Detection and get position in TensorFlow"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12053540,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBR5Lt-VFVWp_FbDlBbRvM62Cv2QUk5csyrkbVIaw=k-s128","display_name":"Tommaso Ghini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12053540/tommaso-ghini"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":5082285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6346341a24fb90f9ac3fb4ef1136d564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Markus Kauppinen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5082285/markus-kauppinen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570774071,"creation_date":1570173066,"last_edit_date":1570179718,"question_id":58231551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58231551","body_markdown":"how can you take the position of an object detect from the camera with tensorflow in android?\r\ni need it to print a new 3D object in that position.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231551/detection-and-get-position-in-tensorflow","title":"Detection and get position in TensorFlow"},{"tags":["textarea","angular7"],"owner":{"reputation":3448,"user_id":2929562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7ea127833d314cefdd5acb40836237a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PAA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2929562/paa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570173028,"creation_date":1570173028,"question_id":58231542,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58231542","body_markdown":"I went through https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42827746/autosize-textarea-in-angular2, and many other link.

Yes. See for an example of this [Where does Firebase fit in your app?](https://firebase.googleblog.com/2013/03/where-does-firebase-fit-in-your-app.html) and [Build an Android App Using Firebase and the App Engine Flexible Environment](https://cloud.google.com/solutions/mobile/mobile-firebase-app-engine-flexible).\r\n\r\n2. The Firebase Realtime Database can be used as your primary database. Just keep in mind that Firebase is not meant to be an offline-only database. If you have an app that never connects to the server, you should consider other options.\r\n\r\n3. Yes.

AS a programming language I am using C#(by doing HTTP request to the Microsoft Graph API).\r\n\r\nActually I have a Window Service that runs at every 2 minutes and make calls to the Microsoft Graph API based on a **deltalink**. The deltalink is used to keep traking between two requests. So, after 2 minutes the service make a call and tells to the Graph API &quot;give me all the changes made on the events for a specific calendar from the last sync&quot;. \r\n\r\nIn my web app I have an entity linked to the event from the calendar. If a change is made on the event in the calendar, I want to make the change also on my entity. I want to keep a sync between that 2 entities(the calendar event and the entity form my web app). \r\nFor example: if I create the entity in my app, an event will be created in the calendar. If I delete the entity from my app, the event will be deleted too, and vice-versa. If I create an event from the calendar, it will be imported in my app...\r\n\r\nMy issue is as follow. \r\nIf I made an entity in my web app, the event is created into the calendar and everything is good. But if I immeadiately delete the event from the calendar, it won&#39;t affect the entity from my web app. Because the events is added and immediately deleted(between two synchronization), it seems that this situation is not treated as an action in the calendar, and no data is sent back to my service.\r\n\r\nIf the event is created and then deleted, it is as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\nIf I want to make this mechanism work, I have to wait to be finished a sync, so I have to wait 2 minutes until the service run again, and after that delete the event in order to make the changes on my entity.\r\n\r\nIf there is someone who has an idea how could I handle this situation in order to know when the event is created and immediately deleted I will be grateful.\r\nSo, any advice could help.

The problem is, that some of the code shouldn&#39;t run if window or control is in design mode (say, loading data from database).\r\n\r\nThere are some well-known solutions to this problem, but all works only partially:\r\n\r\n* `Component.DesignMode` - works only on top-level controls (won&#39;t work in a control placed on a control) and doesn&#39;t work at all in constructors (where actually it is needed most)\r\n* `LicenseManager.UsageMode == LicenseUsageMode.Designtime` - in turn works only in constructurs (so won&#39;t work - say - in `OnPaint` method\r\n* Checking for current process being `devenv.exe` - what is, let&#39;s be honest, more of a painful workaround than solid, deterministic, working method\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been wondering, if there&#39;s a way to deterministically and repeatably verify if control or form is in debug mode?\r\n\r\nThe only solution I&#39;ve come with would be to create specific configuration for design mode only, set a compilation variable and use conditional compilation:\r\n\r\n    public MyForm()\r\n    {\r\n        InitializeComponent();\r\n    #ifndef Design\r\n        ...\r\n    #endif\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problems are:\r\n\r\n* This needs to be switched manually\r\n* If you forget to switch configuration back to Debug or Release, half of the application will probably stop working. However one may solve it by stopping build quickly in Main method:\r\n\r\n        static void Main()\r\n        {\r\n        #ifdef Design\r\n            #error Exit design configuration first!\r\n        #endif\r\n        }\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n1. http://dotnetfacts.blogspot.com/2009/01/identifying-run-time-and-design-mode.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58231460/windows-forms-design-mode-universal-solution","title":"Windows forms design mode universal solution"},{"tags":["apache-spark","hive","apache-spark-sql"],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8236581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CIPbXM4yIsM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/QevGrpPcjZc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Maheshbabu Vanamala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8236581/maheshbabu-vanamala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570172684,"creation_date":1570172684,"question_id":58231458,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58231458","body_markdown":"Not able to query hive table lock info using below SQL query in Spark 2.4.0 shell.\r\n\r\n    spark.sql(&quot;show locks dbName.tableName&quot;)\r\n\r\nGetting below error\r\n\r\n```\r\nscala&gt;
