That could be a lot of extra work.\r\n\r\n  - Downgrade your dev work to Java 8.  That could also be a lot of work, or worse.  (You might have dependencies that are only available for Java 11+.)\r\n\r\n  - Try Java 11 instead of Java 8.  Reasoning:\r\n\r\n       - Java 12 is not an LTS version of Java, but Java 11 is.  Therefore it is more likely that the Paytm gateway software will run on Java 11.\r\n\r\n       - The difference between Java 11 and 12 for your application is not that great.  Looking at the summary of new features in Java 12, there doesn&#39;t look to be anything that you couldn&#39;t do without ... until the next Java LTS release.\r\n\r\n  - Figure out why the Paytm integration doesn&#39;t work in a later version of Java.  On the Github site where the distribute the JAR files, it is implied that the &quot;Java Kit 8&quot; version supports Java 8 *and later versions*.  \r\n\r\n    The problem might related to SSL support in later versions of Java.  Maybe you need to force Java 12 to use an older TLS version to match what the remote gateway service is expecting.\r\n\r\n    There may be clues in your log files; e.g. log messages, stack traces.\r\n\r\n  - Aoid using the problematic (?) Java binding, and change your Java code to talk directly to the Paytm Web API, using HttpClient or similar.  (In fact, trying to see if you can do this from a Java 11 / 12 JVM *may* help you work out what the problem with the Java binding binding is; e.g. if this is a SSL problem.\r\n\r\n  - Contact Paytm support ....\r\n\r\n  - Look for an alternative to Paytm with better support for Java 11 / 12","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008924/is-this-possible-to-run-one-application-on-different-java-version-jdk-1-8-and/58010017#58010017","title":"Is this possible to run one application on different Java version ( JDK 1.8 and JDK 12 )?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11426222,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UPnfK7WssWg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reMVFgZenHhqL0iJCxGJLE2_uPEYQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Surbhi Lalwani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11426222/surbhi-lalwani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2934,"user_id":2390219,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PDYbr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kukis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2390219/kukis"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568937498,"creation_date":1568888637,"last_edit_date":1568889405,"question_id":58008924,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008924","body_markdown":"We are developing web application with payment gateway ( Spring Boot, Paytm ). \r\n\r\nWe are using JDK 12 for our REST application.

is too long for a comment.\r\n\r\nFirst, I assume that the column in `C` would be called `D`, not `A`.\r\n\r\nSecond, you are violating one of the principles of normalization.  The value `D` is being stored in two places (in both tables `A` and `C`), but according to your description it really means one thing.\r\n\r\nWhat you are suggesting is a significant complication to the data model.  It is very different to ensure that the `D` referred to by `A` matches the `D`.  Enforcing this is hard.  Violations become a data error.\r\n\r\nAs for performance, joins on primary keys are usually quite fast.  Chains of such joins are usually not a performance bottleneck.\r\n\r\nAs for maintenance, you end up with very different ways of representing the same result  set.  This can complicate debugging code.\r\n\r\nRelational databases are very flexible, and they definitely support such constructs.  There may be some situations where such an approach is helpful (for instance, if there were a parallel database where the partitioning keys on the tables are on different columns).

In these cases, the column B.tiecondition would allow me to make a choice among the possible matches.\r\n\r\nI suppose the &#39;on&#39; clause might be modified with something like \r\n\r\n    on (\r\n        (A.id = B.id and A.date between B.startdate and B.enddate) \r\n    or  (A.id = B.id and (A.date between B.startdate and B.enddate) and B.tiecondition = 1)\r\n    )  \r\n\r\nbut I am not sure whether I would get the correct result or if there is a more elegant way to do this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I could use a `left join` instead, and add a couple of conditions checking when there are multiple matches in the results and keeping only the rows satisfying to the condition, but this looks a bit cumbersome too.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008815/oracle-sql-merge-into-add-condition-only-where-there-are-multiple-matches","title":"Oracle SQL, merge into: add condition only where there are multiple matches"},{"tags":["angular","dialog","angular-material"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10440,"user_id":6782707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2425200c04f326a53ef0085b703369d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6782707/edric"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568889466,"post_id":58008814,"comment_id":102422415,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008814/angular-material-change-background-color-of-a-dialog-window#comment102422415_58008814"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9535876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pHuWL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yannick.fr.rennes1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9535876/yannick-fr-rennes1"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10440,"user_id":6782707,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2425200c04f326a53ef0085b703369d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Edric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6782707/edric"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568890064,"post_id":58008814,"comment_id":102422788,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008814/angular-material-change-background-color-of-a-dialog-window#comment102422788_58008814"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9535876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pHuWL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yannick.fr.rennes1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9535876/yannick-fr-rennes1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568890629,"post_id":58009191,"comment_id":102423099,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008814/angular-material-change-background-color-of-a-dialog-window/58009191#comment102423099_58009191"},{"owner":{"reputation":613,"user_id":8409133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOCYE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iftifar Taz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8409133/iftifar-taz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9535876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pHuWL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yannick.fr.rennes1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9535876/yannick-fr-rennes1"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568893624,"post_id":58009191,"comment_id":102424757,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008814/angular-material-change-background-color-of-a-dialog-window/58009191#comment102424757_58009191"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9535876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pHuWL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Yannick.fr.rennes1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9535876/yannick-fr-rennes1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568894649,"post_id":58009191,"comment_id":102425310,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008814/angular-material-change-background-color-of-a-dialog-window/58009191#comment102425310_58009191"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":613,"user_id":8409133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uOCYE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Iftifar Taz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8409133/iftifar-taz"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568889609,"creation_date":1568889609,"answer_id":58009191,"question_id":58008814,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58009191","body_markdown":"If you want to do it with css then there are 2 ways.\r\n\r\n 1.

This Message has some custom headers attached for user/password. After validation I&#39;m calling the `SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(..)`. \r\n\r\nA side note: I&#39;m using a tokenbased custom header authentication on the httpendpoints. Sadly [it&#39;s not possible to send a custom header from the browser on the websocket handshake](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4361358/1501375). I had to configure the Websocket Endpoint to `.antMatchers(WebSocketConfig.ENDPOINT).permitAll()` be accessible by everyone. Spring Security\r\n\r\nThe idea is to authenticate a user within the connect message, set the authorization object and let spring security do it&#39;s magic. \r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\r\npublic class WebSocketConfig implements WebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\r\n\r\n    public static final String ENDPOINT = &quot;/gs-guide-websocket&quot;;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {\r\n        config.enableSimpleBroker(&quot;/topic&quot;);\r\n        config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(&quot;/app&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {\r\n        registry.addEndpoint(ENDPOINT).setAllowedOrigins(&quot;*&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void configureClientInboundChannel(final ChannelRegistration registration) {\r\n        registration.interceptors(new XAuthChannelInterceptor(authenticationManager));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static class XAuthChannelInterceptor implements ChannelInterceptor {\r\n\r\n        private AuthenticationManager authenticationManager;\r\n\r\n        public XAuthChannelInterceptor(AuthenticationManager authenticationManager) {\r\n            this.authenticationManager = authenticationManager;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        @Override\r\n        public Message&lt;?&gt; preSend(Message&lt;?&gt; message, MessageChannel channel) {\r\n\r\n            var accessor = SimpMessageHeaderAccessor.wrap(message);\r\n\r\n            // Check Connect\r\n            SimpMessageType messageType = accessor.getMessageType();\r\n            if (messageType == SimpMessageType.CONNECT) {\r\n                try {\r\n                    // Login Credentials\r\n                    var authUser = accessor.getFirstNativeHeader(CustomAuthenticationFilter.X_HEADER_USER);\r\n                    var authPassword = accessor.getFirstNativeHeader(CustomAuthenticationFilter.X_HEADER_PASS);\r\n                    // Try Login\r\n                    var requestAuthentication = new UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken(authUser, authPassword);\r\n                    var responseAuthentication = authenticationManager.authenticate(requestAuthentication);\r\n                    // Set User\r\n                    accessor.setUser(responseAuthentication);\r\n                    SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(responseAuthentication);\r\n                } catch (Exception e) {\r\n                    throw new RuntimeException(&quot;login failed&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return message;\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to work just fine. But: When the Message arrives in the Controller the Authentication Object is gone. Well that&#39;s because `SecurityContextHolder` works ThreadLocal.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Controller\r\npublic class GreetingController {\r\n\r\n    @MessageMapping(&quot;/hello&quot;)\r\n    @SendTo(&quot;/topic/greetings&quot;)\r\n    public CreateCustomerCommandResult greeting(CreateCustomerCommand cmd) throws Exception {\r\n        \r\n        var x = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication();\r\n\r\n        Thread.sleep(1000);

sub-dataframes:\r\n\r\n    pairs = [df.loc[x:x+1] \r\n        for x in range(0, df.shape[0]-1) if df.loc[x, &#39;set_id&#39;]==df.loc[x+1, &#39;set_id&#39;]-1]\r\n\r\n*pairs* then contains list of dataframes:\r\n\r\n    for s in pairs:\r\n        print(s, type(s))\r\n\r\n    Output:\r\n       set  data\r\n    1    0   -45\r\n    2    1   -52 &lt;class

CONNECTORS could be multiple this is the reason why I choose Arraylist  \r\n\r\nI already can read &quot;12&quot; by the custom class I created but it seems I&#39;m unable to access subcollection.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008779/reading-firestore-subcollection-as-class-object","title":"reading Firestore subcollection as class object"},{"tags":["sql-server","select"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2250,"user_id":2794280,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zsXSk.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ikram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2794280/ikram"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568888292,"post_id":58008778,"comment_id":102421828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008778/select-id-from-4-tables-sql-server#comment102421828_58008778"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":302,"user_id":12055980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Dy1f.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Au Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12055980/au-nguyen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":164,"user_id":11459145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oMhpumjhALc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcbwqBn8RNoV1eW1ItH868s_gUniA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11459145/andreas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568896825,"last_edit_date":1568896825,"creation_date":1568888588,"answer_id":58008905,"question_id":58008778,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58008905","body_markdown":"You can use UNION ALL select: \r\n\r\n    SELECT name\r\n    FROM Job\r\n    WHERE ID=0\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT name\r\n    FROM  Home \r\n    WHERE ID=0\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT name\r\n    FROM Games\r\n    WHERE ID=0\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT name\r\n    FROM Example \r\n    WHERE ID=0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008778/select-id-from-4-tables-sql-server/58008905#58008905","title":"SELECT ID from 4 Tables SQL SERVER"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12061753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7612f362f9aa9e511ea59aa33e57ad21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SometingNew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061753/sometingnew"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58008905,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568896825,"creation_date":1568888185,"question_id":58008778,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008778","body_markdown":"Have 4 tables like in image (Tables name are: Job, Home, Games, Example) there is no **persons** sorry for the error\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7D7A1.png\r\n\r\nI would like to SELECT only the ones with **ID=0**, so my output would be \r\n\r\noutput\r\n\r\n    Jean\r\n    Robocop\r\n    Witcher\r\n    Example1\r\n\r\nthis is my code so far\r\n\r\n    SELECT Job.name, Home.name, Games.name, Example.name \r\n    FROM Job, Home, Games, Example \r\n    WHERE ID=0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008778/select-id-from-4-tables-sql-server","title":"SELECT ID from 4 Tables SQL SERVER"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","ios-simulator","xcode11"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11727,"user_id":551519,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/89e9af7c5754673419c8fac930319700?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"russbishop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/551519/russbishop"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570853388,"post_id":58008775,"comment_id":103056000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008775/xcode-11-simulatortrampoline-xpc-wants-to-access-files-managed-by-icloud-dri#comment103056000_58008775"}],"owner":{"reputation":2375,"user_id":1311272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":41,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac5b9faef78e585b08b241771148c77c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sajjon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1311272/sajjon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":172,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568888175,"creation_date":1568888175,"question_id":58008775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008775","body_markdown":"Recently updated to Xcode 11 GM seed 2 (`11A420a`) and I when running my app on a simulator (`iPhone Xs Max` (probably irrelevant)) a dialog popped up asking permission to access my iCloud.\r\n\r\nWhy?

have been trying soo hard to find a solution to this problem. I have implemented Crashlytics successfully in a simple app, like an app containing a simple button a text to display. I have even tested it in **Firebase** console , and it logs a custom exception successfully using the following line..\r\n\r\n`Crashlytics.logException(new IOException(&quot;A dummy IOException&quot;))`;\r\n\r\nI have followed the following link for Crashlytics implementation \r\n[Crashlytics official tutorial][1]\r\n\r\nAnd I can see a non-fatal error logged in Firebase console after around 5 minutes in the console only.\r\n\r\nBut when the app became somewhat complex, like when I used Firebase ML Vision library for some scanning purpose and a bunch of other libraries, it started throwing the following error everytime the code for Crashlytics logging is executed.\r\n\r\n    `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Must Initialize Fabric before using singleton()\r\n            at io.fabric.sdk.android.Fabric.singleton(Fabric.java:301)\r\n            at io.fabric.sdk.android.Fabric.getKit(Fabric.java:551)\r\n            at com.crashlytics.android.Crashlytics.getInstance(Crashlytics.java:191)\r\n            at com.crashlytics.android.Crashlytics.checkInitialized(Crashlytics.java:390)\r\n            at com.crashlytics.android.Crashlytics.logException(Crashlytics.java:210)\r\n            at co.behtar.behtarinternal.MainActivity$1.onClick(MainActivity.java:29)\r\n            at android.view.View.performClick(View.java:7341)\r\n            at android.widget.TextView.performClick(TextView.java:14226)\r\n            at android.view.View.performClickInternal(View.java:7307)\r\n            at android.view.View.access$3200(View.java:846)\r\n            at android.view.View$PerformClick.run(View.java:27796)\r\n            at android.os.Handler.handleCallback(Handler.java:873)\r\n            at android.os.Handler.dispatchMessage(Handler.java:99)\r\n            at android.os.Looper.loop(Looper.java:214)\r\n            at android.app.ActivityThread.main(ActivityThread.java:7156)\r\n            at java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke(Native Method)\r\n            at com.android.internal.os.RuntimeInit$MethodAndArgsCaller.run(RuntimeInit.java:494)\r\n            at com.android.internal.os.ZygoteInit.main(ZygoteInit.java:975)`\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t have to initialize **Fabric** before and **Crashlytics** worked seemlessly in that case. But in this case when some libraries I have used, even if I have initialized Fabric in a number of ways inside MainActivity and even inside Application class too, it still throws this error. \r\n\r\nI have spent around 3 whole days searching for a solution and in the course of event, even created a Fabric account and integrated Fabric using its onboarding page. But still no success with the Crash logging.\r\n\r\nI have followed following link for Fabric implementation\r\n[Fabric for Crashlytics official doc][2]\r\n\r\nDid anyone around faced a similar issue like mine?? if so, what steps did you follow to get rid of it in order for **Crashlytics** to work?\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; EDIT\r\n\r\nHere is the code snippet where I initialize Fabric, even though it is not required in Firebase Crashlytics, I have tried this one..\r\n\r\n    public class App extends Application {\r\n    AppComponent appComponent;\r\n    private static Context context;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onCreate() {\r\n        super.onCreate();\r\n        Fresco.initialize(this);\r\n        Fabric.with(this, new Crashlytics());\r\n        if (BuildConfig.DEBUG) {\r\n            Timber.plant(new Timber.DebugTree());\r\n        }\r\n        context = this;\r\n        appComponent = DaggerAppComponent.builder().appModule(new AppModule(this)).utilsModule(new UtilsModule()).build();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static Context getContext() {\r\n        return context;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public AppComponent getAppComponent() {\r\n        return appComponent;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nAnd here is the code snippet where I called `Crashlytics.logException()`\r\n\r\n    private void renderErrorResponse(Throwable error) {\r\n        if (error instanceof HttpException) {\r\n            ResponseBody responseBody = ((HttpException) error).response().errorBody();\r\n            LoginErrorResponse loginErrorResponse;\r\n            try {\r\n                String responseString = null;\r\n                if (responseBody != null) {\r\n                    responseString = responseBody.string();\r\n                }\r\n                if (Utils.isValidJson(responseString)) {\r\n                    responseString = Utils.toPrettyFormat(responseString);\r\n                    loginErrorResponse = gson.fromJson(responseString, LoginErrorResponse.class);\r\n                    Utils.logMessage(&quot;LoginError&quot;, responseString);\r\n                    Utils.showCustomToast(this, loginErrorResponse.getNon_field_errors().get(0));\r\n                }\r\n            } catch (IOException e) {\r\n                Utils.logError(&quot;IOException&quot;, e);\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            Utils.showCustomToast(this, this.getString(R.string.something_went_wrong));\r\n            Crashlytics.logException(error);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2:** \r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the error which is coming now after adding api key in manifest and changing fabric initialization code as @Romadro suggested.\r\n\r\n    The Crashlytics build ID is missing.

They enter email, choose a date, and submit. That&#39;s all. Then in my database I store info about what webinar they are registered for.\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t want them to always see a blank registration page. If they already registered, I would rather display a message about the webinar they registered for. I thought about forcing visitors to register on my site in order to register for a webinar, but I don&#39;t want to force visitors through multiple steps.\r\n\r\nSo I was thinking maybe this is where cookies would come in? \r\n\r\nI read here https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/requests but the info is quite minimal. \r\n\r\nSay someone registers for a webinar. In the form controller after successful registration there is this call:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn back()-&gt;with(&#39;success&#39;, &#39;Thanks for registering for the free webinar!&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Laravel docs show cookie setting in this form:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn response(&#39;Hello World&#39;)-&gt;cookie(\r\n    &#39;name&#39;, &#39;value&#39;, $minutes\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI figure `return-&gt;back()` is like a `response` in that I could append a cookie and tried doing this:\r\n\r\n``` $cookie = \\Cookie::queue(&#39;reg_id&#39;, $registrant-&gt;id, 1000);\r\n        return back()-&gt;with(&#39;success&#39;, &#39;Thanks for registering for the free webinar!&#39;)-&gt;withCookie($cookie);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nBut `cookie` is returned `null` even though `$registrant-&gt;id` is an integer. \r\n\r\nAny idea what I might be doing wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008768/laravel-using-cookies-to-display-visitor-specific-information","title":"Laravel - using cookies to display visitor specific information?"},{"tags":["javascript","performance","iframe","cross-domain","latency"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18850,"user_id":1169519,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j4Iyy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Teemu-callmewhateveryouwant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1169519/teemu-callmewhateveryouwant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568888456,"post_id":58008760,"comment_id":102421925,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008760/latency-while-accessing-cross-domain-application-within-iframe#comment102421925_58008760"},{"owner":{"reputation":649,"user_id":254694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3ab3129ddef520dbeeaa52c9e0723a48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user254694","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/254694/user254694"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568888489,"post_id":58008760,"comment_id":102421943,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008760/latency-while-accessing-cross-domain-application-within-iframe#comment102421943_58008760"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":4640075,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f95b962597d880cf67a5d376edfa9210?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"prasanna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4640075/prasanna"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568888128,"creation_date":1568888128,"question_id":58008760,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008760","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve this generic query.

Also, is there a way to minimize the latency for first time users or is this obvious ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008760/latency-while-accessing-cross-domain-application-within-iframe","title":"Latency while accessing cross domain application within iFrame"},{"tags":["vue.js","state","vuex","getter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568891884,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102423756,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102423756_58008757"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11520187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QS0BdAzcoD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b6_50On7lZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John&#39;Sters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11520187/johnsters"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568892437,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102424085,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102424085_58008757"},{"owner":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568892934,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102424355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102424355_58008757"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11520187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QS0BdAzcoD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b6_50On7lZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John&#39;Sters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11520187/johnsters"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893425,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102424657,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102424657_58008757"},{"owner":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893586,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102424742,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102424742_58008757"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11520187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QS0BdAzcoD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b6_50On7lZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John&#39;Sters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11520187/johnsters"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":208,"user_id":7286153,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YevKv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PeeJee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7286153/peejee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893747,"post_id":58008757,"comment_id":102424835,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008757/vue-vuex-and-empty-state#comment102424835_58008757"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11520187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QS0BdAzcoD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b6_50On7lZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John&#39;Sters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11520187/johnsters"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11520187,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QS0BdAzcoD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/b6_50On7lZQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John&#39;Sters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11520187/johnsters"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571816412,"creation_date":1568888122,"last_edit_date":1571816412,"question_id":58008757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008757","body_markdown":"Good morning everyone. \r\n\r\nI have been struggling for several days on an app I&#39;m trying to build for some experience.

think I figured it out. Bottom line was that this *was* a genuine RX overrun due to my code not reading the uart buffers fast enough. When I make sure to &quot;read&quot; the serial port fast enough, I can attain the constant Mbaud data rate. The reason I got totally misguided (and that the weird and unexpected FTDI_RS_OE is sent) I will explain below.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few notes on the protocol I was using. I was sending some &quot;request&quot; packet on the serial line, and expecting a large reply. (and doing this in loop). &quot;My bug&quot; was that I expected the remote device to reply very quickly, and if not stop processing. This timeout was too short, but the actual reply did still come in. &quot;Some&quot; buffer then overflowed, causing the RX overruns.\r\n\r\nBut, this was not so clear. A few subtleties: \r\n\r\n- The rx overrun counter was only incremented upon the NEXT uart read syscall (e.g. minutes later if my code went to some idle state) (NOT immediately after the actual issue happened, which is very confusing)\r\n\r\n- I was under the assumption that, just like the imx6 driver, the linux kernel would always simply service the USB device if incoming data was available. And that the data would be sent into a 640kB buffer (defined https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.9.192/source/drivers/tty/tty_buffer.c). In the imx6 driver it can then clearly be seen what happens if that buffer overflows\r\n\r\nBut that turns out not to be the case. Instead, my best guess at what happens here (I haven&#39;t profiled/debugged the kernel to verify this) is that serial &quot;throtteling&quot; happens. When this 640kB is &quot;getting&quot; full, linux will issue a &quot;throttle&quot; callback to the FTDI driver. That then simply uses the generic usb_serial_generic_throttle, which sets a flag, and discards incoming urb data in https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/ident/usb_serial_generic_read_bulk_callback. This would explain why no overruns are &quot;detected&quot; when the incident actually occurs, but suddenly is detected when (e.g. after 1 minute of inactivity) I restart a read operation.

When I checked that `@Autowired` field, its keys contain the same default values.\r\n\r\nI know that there is a solution that always inject the collection by name, like:\r\n\r\n    // use place\r\n    @Resource(name = &quot;myBean&quot;)\r\n    private Map&lt;String, DummyInterface&gt; collection;\r\n    \r\n    // configuration class\r\n    @Bean(name = &quot;myBean&quot;)\r\n    public

Function.identity()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut it needs the collection to be annotated with `@Resource(name = &quot;someName&quot;)` all the time, and create strong couple relationship between the configuration bean and autowired bean.\r\n\r\nIs there any better solution to achieve this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008727/spring-how-to-replace-springs-default-collection-injection-strategy-for-speci","title":"Spring : How to replace Spring&#39;s default
