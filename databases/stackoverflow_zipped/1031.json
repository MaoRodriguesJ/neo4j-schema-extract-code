This one is the closest I came. I am trying to call an API but on each item in an array. I can&#39;t do this in a regular loop, so many reasons why not. So someone said use the array.map() function instead of a loop. I got this far: \r\n\r\n    const IMAGE_BASE_URL = &#39;https://csdx.blob.core.windows.net/resources/Face/Images/&#39;\r\n    let sourceImageFileNames = [&#39;Family1-Dad3.jpg&#39;, &#39;Family1-Son1.jpg&#39;]\r\n    \r\n    // Detect faces in the source image array, then get their IDs\r\n    let sourcefaceMap = await Promise.all(sourceImageFileNames.map(async (imageName) =&gt; {\r\n       // Returns a Promise&lt;DetectedFace[]&gt;\r\n        await client.face.detectWithUrl(IMAGE_BASE_URL + imageName)\r\n            .then((faces) =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(`${faces.length} face detected from image ${imageName} with ID ${faces[0].faceId}`)\r\n                let id = faces[0].faceId\r\n                return { ...imageName, id } \r\n            }).catch((err) =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(`No face detected in: ${sourceImageFileNames[0]}.`)\r\n                throw err;\r\n            })\r\n    }))\r\n\r\n    let values = Object.values(sourcefaceMap)\r\n    console.log(values)\r\n\r\n    // Create an array to store the source face IDs\r\n    var sourceFaceIds = new Array(sourceImageFileNames.length)\r\n    console.log(sourceFaceIds)\r\n    let ids = sourceFaceIds.filter((id)=&gt; {\r\n        return id != null;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    console.log(ids)\r\n\r\nThe values seem to be there in when debugging, but then when I try to return the map, it prints out as undefined. Even though the map does do the job of looping to get each id (as seen in the top two print statements).\r\nHere is my printout:\r\n\r\n    VERIFY\r\n    1 face(s) detected from image Family1-Dad3.jpg with ID f94360f5-feb3-4d14-816f-7d854fc0b34c\r\n    1 face(s) detected from image Family1-Son1.jpg with ID 98091e1e-bc8d-4c93-a850-a115684a6e6e\r\n    [ undefined, undefined ]\r\n    [ &lt;2 empty items&gt; ]\r\n    [ &lt;2 empty items&gt; ]\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of the id having value, when I hover over it in the return statement:\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBasically, I am trying to do an API call with URL images, then the API will associate an ID with each face in the image. I need the API call to return all those IDs. In this case, it&#39;s only 2 IDs. How do I do this? At the end of my code, I just need an array of those IDs. That&#39;s all.

It&#39;s correct to use a pointer to the pointer, but you need to dereference it. For this you need to pass the pointer to ``hist`` and dereference it at the re-allocation:\r\n\r\n        *arr = realloc(*arr, sizeof(char*) * (length + 2));\r\n\r\n1. The list of pointers is not initialized, after the first allocation you need to set the first pointer:\r\n\r\n        hist[0] = NULL;\r\n\r\n1. The allocations for your test strings are 1 off:\r\n\r\n        linep1 = malloc((strlen(&quot;test&quot;) + 1) * sizeof(char));\r\n        linep2 = malloc((strlen(&quot;test2&quot;) + 1) * sizeof(char));\r\n        linep3 = malloc((strlen(&quot;test3&quot;) + 1) * sizeof(char));\r\n        linep4 = malloc((strlen(&quot;test4&quot;) + 1) * sizeof(char));\r\n\r\nAdditional notes:\r\n\r\n- The includes are missing for a complete [minimal reproducable example][1].\r\n- The name `apparr()` is wrong, you call `apphist()` in `main()`.\r\n- Check the return values of any allocation for NULL, meaning that the allocation failed.\r\n- You don&#39;t use `argc` and `argv`, so write `int main(void)`\r\n- The first allocation has the &quot;wrong&quot; type, but both are pointers, so it&#39;s the same size: `char** hist = malloc(sizeof(char*));`\r\n- There is no need to cast pointers returned by `malloc()` as it returns a pointer to `void`. Pointers to `void` and other pointers can be assigned back and forth without casts.\r\n- You can replace the `malloc()`/`strcpy()` pairs with `strdup()`.\r\n- You can even call `apphist()` with the string as &quot;immediate&quot; value like this: `apphist(hist, &quot;test&quot;);`\r\n- `main()` should return an `int`, `EXIT_SUCCESS` is the right value.\r\n- You can put some `const` at the parameters and declarations to make things safer. But think about *what* is constant.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297107/realloc-only-works-twice/58297994#58297994","title":"Realloc only works twice"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61470,"user_id":694576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PpOGj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/694576/alk"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570603905,"creation_date":1570603905,"answer_id":58298541,"question_id":58297107,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298541","body_markdown":"All errors and may pitfalls have been mentioned by others already.\r\n\r\nBelow find a more general implementation of the append-element-to-array function:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;errno.h&gt; /* for EINVAL */\r\n\r\n    int apparr(char *** parr, char * line) {\r\n      size_t length = 0;\r\n\r\n      if (NULL == *parr) {\r\n        if (NULL != line) {\r\n          errno = EINVAL;\r\n          return -1;\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        // find the length of the array\r\n        while (NULL != (*parr)[length]) {\r\n          ++length;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      {\r\n        // realloc with 2 extra spaces (1 for line, 1 for NULL)\r\n        void * pv = realloc(*parr, (length+1) * sizeof **parr);\r\n        if (NULL == pv) {\r\n          return -1; /* By convention -1 indicates failure. */\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        *parr = pv;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      (*parr)[length] = line;\r\n      if (0 &lt; length) {\r\n        (*parr)[length + 1] = NULL;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return 0; /* By convention 0 indicates success. */\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd use it like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    int apparr(char *** parr, char * line) {\r\n\r\n    int main(int argc, char** argv) {\r\n\t  char ** hist = NULL;\r\n      char * linep1;\r\n      char * linep2;\r\n\t  char * linep3;\r\n\t  char * linep4;\r\n\r\n      if (-1 == apparr(&amp;hist, NULL)) {\r\n        perror(&quot;apphist() failed initially\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      linep1 = malloc(strlen(&quot;test&quot;) + 1);\r\n\t  linep2 = malloc(strlen(&quot;test2&quot;) + 1); /* +1 for the c-string&#39;s 0-termination; sizeof (char) is 1 by definition */\r\n\t  linep3 = malloc(strlen(&quot;test3&quot;) + 1);\r\n\t  linep4 = malloc(strlen(&quot;test4&quot;) + 1);\r\n\t\r\n      strcpy(linep1, &quot;test&quot;);\r\n\t  strcpy(linep2, &quot;test2&quot;);\r\n\t  strcpy(linep3, &quot;test3&quot;);\r\n\t  strcpy(linep4, &quot;test4&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t  if (-1 == apphist(&amp;hist, linep1)) {\r\n        perror(&quot;apphist() failed for line 1\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\t  if (-1 == apphist(&amp;hist, linep2) {\r\n        perror(&quot;apphist() failed for line 2\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\t  if (-1 == apphist(&amp;hist, linep3) {\r\n        perror(&quot;apphist() failed for line 3\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\t  if (-1 == apphist(&amp;hist, linep4)  {\r\n        perror(&quot;apphist() failed for line 4\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n      }\r\n \r\n\t  {\r\n        size_t x = 0;\r\n        while (hist[x] != NULL) {\r\n\t\t  printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;, hist[x]);\r\n\t\t  ++x;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297107/realloc-only-works-twice/58298541#58298541","title":"Realloc only works twice"}],"owner":{"reputation":1499,"user_id":4848801,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/700003af13fc16520eeff211d66e2c84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan Schaefer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4848801/ryan-schaefer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1499,"user_id":4848801,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/700003af13fc16520eeff211d66e2c84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ryan Schaefer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4848801/ryan-schaefer"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58297581,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570683223,"creation_date":1570595501,"last_edit_date":1570597330,"question_id":58297107,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297107","body_markdown":"For some reason, when I realloc an array to append an item to the array, it only works twice before segfaulting.

of millions of additional relationships, you could instead query for inherited Item properties when necessary.\r\n\r\nFor instance, to start a query for `Object` 123 (that needs to take the  inherited

WITH p, REDUCE(t = x, x IN COLLECT(used) | apoc.map.merge(t, PROPERTIES(v))) AS used\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nBy the way, you would need some of the same logic anyway even if you had the extra relationships you originally asked for.\r\n\r\nNote: This algorithm (which sorts by descending `path` length) only works properly if there is a single leaf ancester and a single path to that ancester.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297071/cypher-play-inheritance-rules/58309118#58309118","title":"Cypher: play inheritance

have nodes organized in tree ( (:Object)-[:PARENT]-&gt;(:Object) )  \r\nAn Object can use many Item  ( {:Object)-[:USE]-&gt;(:Item) )  \r\n\r\nWe would like play an inheritance rule:  \r\nif the

Each Machine needs to be able to inform its parent, using a delegate, of something they do but they do not have a reference to the parent:\r\n\r\n    Public Delegate Sub MachineDelegate(ByRef item As Machine)\r\n    \r\n    Public MustInherit Class Machines\r\n    \r\n        Private _items As New List(Of Machine)\r\n    \r\n        Public Function Create() As Machine\r\n            Dim item As Machine = CreateItem()\r\n            _items.Add(item)\r\n            PostCreationHandler(item)\r\n            Return item\r\n        End Function\r\n    \r\n        &#39; Create derived object\r\n        Public MustOverride Function CreateItem() As Machine\r\n    \r\n        Public Sub ChildMachineDidSomething(ByRef item As Machine)\r\n            &#39; Handle child object event\r\n            Debug.Print(&quot;Machine did something&quot;)\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n        &#39; Called once object has been created\r\n        Protected Overridable Sub PostCreationHandler(ByRef item As Machine)\r\n            item.MachineDelegate = AddressOf ChildMachineDidSomething\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n    End Class\r\n\r\n    Public Class Machine\r\n        Public MachineDelegate As MachineDelegate\r\n    \r\n        Public Sub DoMachineThing()\r\n            If Not MachineDelegate Is Nothing Then MachineDelegate(Me)\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n    End Class\r\n\r\nThe child objects will use a `MachineDelegate` to inform their parent, passing themselves as a reference.\r\n\r\nInherited Cars and Car classes would look like this and have their own delegate to handle Car-related notifications:\r\n\r\n    Public Delegate Sub CarDelegate(ByRef item As Car)\r\n    \r\n    Public Class Cars\r\n        Inherits Machines\r\n    \r\n        &#39; Create derived object\r\n        Public Overrides Function CreateItem() As Machine\r\n            Dim item As Car = New Car\r\n            CreateItem = item\r\n        End Function\r\n    \r\n        Public Sub ChildCarDidSomething(ByRef item As Car)\r\n            &#39; Handle child object event\r\n            Debug.Print(&quot;Car did something&quot;)\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n        &#39; Called once object has been created\r\n        Protected Overrides Sub PostCreationHandler(ByRef item As Machine)\r\n            Dim car As Car = item\r\n    \r\n            MyBase.PostCreationHandler(item)\r\n    \r\n            car.CarDelegate = AddressOf ChildCarDidSomething\r\n    \r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n    End Class\r\n\r\n    Public Class Car\r\n        Inherits Machine\r\n    \r\n        Public CarDelegate As CarDelegate\r\n    \r\n        Public Sub DoCarThing()\r\n            If Not CarDelegate Is Nothing Then CarDelegate(Me)\r\n        End Sub\r\n    \r\n    End Class\r\n\r\nI create an overridable `PostCreationHandler` where object-specific initialization is to be handled once an object is created and I am using `MyBase.PostCreationHandler` to make sure the object gets properly initialized at every level in the inheritance chain.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to avoid giving child objects a reference to their parent.\r\n\r\nMy question is is this OK and is there a better approach to doing this?

No need to do that since you&#39;re only using that for the amount of times the for loop will go based on the user input. Also, this should all be passed to a function that has two paramters: One to accept and integer and the other to accept a string. For example:\r\n```\r\nrepeat(intA, strB)\r\n```\r\nAlso, my suggestion would be to concatenate. Add your strings together instead of just displaying it multiple times. This will also allow you to create a new variable that will later be returned to the function that called it.

I&#39;m not asking for answers, I would just like to know how to get started on this.   \r\nMy initial ideas are to:    \r\n1. Have user input str(&quot;example word&quot;)  \r\n2. Have user input int(&quot;Example number&quot;)  \r\n3. Use a for loop to read the number and then print the word out.   \r\n\r\nSo far, my code is as shown below:\r\n```\r\ndef repeat():\r\n    word=str(input(&quot;Please input a single word: &quot;))\r\n    number=int(input(&quot;Please input a number: &quot;))\r\n    for i in range(number):\r\n        number+=1\r\n        print(word,end=&quot; &quot;,sep=&#39;&#39;)\r\nrepeat()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I&#39;m running into two issues:  \r\n1.

Let&#39;s [see the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/scheduledtasks/register-scheduledtask?view=win10-ps).\r\n\r\nYou are using `-InputObject`, and it&#39;s defined in one of the four signatures available like so:\r\n\r\n    Register-ScheduledTask\r\n            [-Force]\r\n            [-InputObject] &lt;CimInstance&gt;\r\n            [[-Password] &lt;String&gt;]\r\n            [[-User] &lt;String&gt;]\r\n            [[-TaskName] &lt;String&gt;]\r\n            [[-TaskPath] &lt;String&gt;]\r\n            [-CimSession &lt;CimSession[]&gt;]\r\n            [-ThrottleLimit &lt;Int32&gt;]\r\n            [-AsJob]\r\n            [&lt;CommonParameters&gt;]\r\n\r\nYou are also using `-Description`, which doesn&#39;t exist in the signature above.

In such case you can obtain your answer in `O(1)` for free.\r\n\r\n As @JonClements suggested in a comments try `bit_length()` and measure if it is `O(1)` or `O(log(n))` ...\r\n\r\n2. **Your `while` is `O(n^3)` instead of `O(n^2)`**\r\n\r\n You are bitshifting from 1 over and over again in each iteration. Why not just shift last result by 1 bit again instead? Something like \r\n\r\n         for (y=0,yy=1;yy&lt;1009;y++,yy&lt;&lt;=1);\r\n\r\n3. **using `log2` might be faster**\r\n\r\n in case the bignum class you use have it implemented correctly after some number size threshold the `log2(1009)` might be signifficantly faster. But that depends on the type of numbers you using and bignum implementation itself.\r\n\r\n4. **bit-shifting can be even faster**\r\n\r\n If you got some upper limit on your numbers you can use **binary search** converting your bitshifting into `O(n.log2(n))`.\r\n\r\n If not you can start bitshifting by 32 bits instead of by 1 when reached target size bitshift by 1 bit. Or even use more layers like `1024/128/16/1` bits. The complexity would be still `O(n^2)` but the constant time would be ~1024 times smaller speeding up ~1024 times your code for big numbers...\r\n\r\n Other option is to find the limit by shifting by 1 bit, then by 2 then by 4,8,16,32,64,... until result is bigger than your target number and from there either bitshift back or use binary search. This one would be `O(n.log2(n))` even without any upper limit..\r\n\r\n However all of these brings up much higher overhead and will slow down the processing of smaller numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nConstructing  `2^(y-1) &lt; x &lt;= 2^y` might be possible to enhance too. For example by using bit shifting approach to find the `y` you got your answer as byproduct for free. For example with floating point or fixed point numbers you can directly construct such number as computing exponent for 1 or by setting correct bit in the zero ... But for arbitrary numbers (where size of number is dynamic) i sthis much harder/slower. So all boils down what kind of bignums class you got and what values you use.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296976/fastest-way-to-find-powers-of-two-higher-than-a-number/58300697#58300697","title":"Fastest way to find powers of two higher than a number"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11938023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cca4cf2bdd1880354bec8cbcd73f8189?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"oppressionslayer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938023/oppressionslayer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24,"user_id":11938023,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cca4cf2bdd1880354bec8cbcd73f8189?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"oppressionslayer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938023/oppressionslayer"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":98,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570618307,"creation_date":1570594450,"last_edit_date":1570599122,"question_id":58296976,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296976","body_markdown":"I am trying to find a very fast way to find the next higher powers of 2 than a very large number (1,000,000) digits.

In this instance I would suggest researching property binding. For example with the placeholder property you can write:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;input [placeholder]=&quot;someVariable&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThen declare the someVariable in your component and what ever you set it to will be the placeholder and you can access it that way. The [] lets you set it to a variable in your component and will update the placeholder whenever you change it in your component. I would try experimenting with this to get an understanding for how it works.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58297226#58297226","title":"Can I Get Online Value Using Javascript/angular?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11974810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/404b5b4f34f0a2854995fee5ef6182d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974810/mike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570634635,"post_id":58305279,"comment_id":102976601,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58305279#comment102976601_58305279"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39796,"user_id":5535245,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YnjcO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"georgeawg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5535245/georgeawg"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570627649,"creation_date":1570627649,"answer_id":58305279,"question_id":58296927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58305279","body_markdown":"&gt;so how can I get the value of `canFocus` using java script\r\n\r\nUse either:\r\n\r\n    $rootScope.canFocus\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n    $scope.$root.canFocus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58305279#58305279","title":"Can I Get Online Value Using Javascript/angular?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11974810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/404b5b4f34f0a2854995fee5ef6182d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974810/mike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570689050,"post_id":58316464,"comment_id":102993462,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58316464#comment102993462_58316464"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11604365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1014defdbfdfe10d2056215b78d923b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Veeresh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11604365/veeresh-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11974810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/404b5b4f34f0a2854995fee5ef6182d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974810/mike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570689375,"post_id":58316464,"comment_id":102993609,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58316464#comment102993609_58316464"},{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":11974810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/404b5b4f34f0a2854995fee5ef6182d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11974810/mike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570691571,"post_id":58316464,"comment_id":102994549,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296927/can-i-get-online-value-using-javascript-angular/58316464#comment102994549_58316464"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11604365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1014defdbfdfe10d2056215b78d923b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Veeresh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11604365/veeresh-kumar"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570687857,"creation_date":1570687857,"answer_id":58316464,"question_id":58296927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58316464","body_markdown":"To use $rootScope,$scope in your controllers, you need to import it then you can use variables to get values like\r\n\r\n    $scope.title\r\n    $scope.canFocus\r\nif you want to use $rootScope just use this\r\n$rootScope.title\r\n$rootScope.canFocus\r\n\r\nIn your HTML\r\ntitle,canFocus should work with your code\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;\r\n       class=&quot;menuTitleField ng-pristine ng-untouched ng-valid ng-isolate-scope ng-valid-required&quot;
