The biggest one is that in order to make your string longer, someone must allocate more memory for it; you cannot simply overwrite the end of the current string. Often the allocation happens automatically for you, but only when you use a method that supports changing the length of the string (e.g. concatenation, as in `gendata += s`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go through some problematic lines.\r\n\r\n    int size = gendata.length();\r\n\r\nYou calculate the size of the string outside the loop, then use it inside the loop. However, if there is more than one digit-to-alpha transition, the size is (intended to be) outdated. You should use the current length of the string instead of this stale number.\r\n\r\n    int flag=0;\r\n\r\nYou are using `flag` as a yes/no toggle. The proper type for that (to express your intent) is `bool`. Also, this flag is used only inside the loop and it is reset to a false value with each iteration. Your code would be more organized if `flag` was declared inside the loop instead of outside it. (No errors from this at the moment, just style improvements.)\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; gendata.length(); i++){\r\n\r\nSince you use `gendata[i+1]` inside the loop, you need to also make sure that `i+1 &lt; gendata.length()`. Well, since `i+1 &lt; gendata.length()` implies `i &lt; gendata.length()`, most people would check just the former instead of checking both.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you turn on your compiler&#39;s warnings, you should get a warning about comparing signed and unsigned values (`i` is signed, while `string::length()` returns an unsigned value). It&#39;s a pain at first, but appeasing those warnings tends to be beneficial in the long run.\r\n\r\n            for (int j=size+1; j&lt;0; j--) {\r\n\r\nThis is the line that had a typo initially. Apparently the `&lt;` is actually in your code. You probably meant `&gt;`, since you appear to be trying to loop from a positive number down to zero. (Plus, as I mentioned earlier, you should use `gendata.length()` instead of `size` here since your intent is to have possibly changed the length of the string.)\r\n\r\n                gendata[j] = gendata[j-1];\r\n\r\nWhen `j` is `size+1`, the expression `gendata[j]` results in undefined behavior. When `j` is `size`, assigning a (non-null) value to `gendata[j]` results in undefined behavior. See [`string::operator[]`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/operator_at).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOK, time to look for a solution. You are making things hard on yourself by trying to manipulate a string&#39;s data instead of manipulating the string itself. You could simply [tell the string to insert a space](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/insert): `gendata.insert(i+1, 1, &#39; &#39;);`. The `i+1` is where you want the space to appear, the second parameter is the number of spaces to insert, and the `&#39; &#39;` is the character to insert.\r\n\r\nBy using the string&#39;s API, your outer `for` loop can become much shorter.\r\n\r\n    for (unsigned i = 0; i+1 &lt; gendata.length(); i++){\r\n        if(isdigit(gendata[i]) &amp;&amp; isalpha(gendata[i+1])){\r\n            gendata.insert(i+1, 1, &#39; &#39;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere is a caveat with this sort of code though: you are changing the string that you are iterating over. When this happens, extra care is warranted to make sure the change doesn&#39;t disrupt the loop. (In this case, it works since a space is not a digit.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108954/c-function-to-add-space-between-digits-and-alpahbets/58125781#58125781","title":"C++ function to add space between digits and alpahbets"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11305592"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58109469,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569539190,"creation_date":1569466503,"last_edit_date":1569468507,"question_id":58108954,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58108954","body_markdown":"I have this string which look like this\r\n```\r\n90hello\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wanted to add a space between them, so I created a function\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n    int size = text.length();\r\n    int flag = 0;\r\n    \r\n    for (int i=0; i&lt;size; i++) {\r\n        flag=0\r\n        if(isdigit(text[i]) &amp;&amp; isalpha(text[i+1])){\r\n            for (int j=size+!; j&lt;0; j--) {\r\n                text[j] == text[j-1];\r\n            }\r\n            flag++;\r\n        }\r\n        if(flag!=0)\r\n            text[i+1]=&quot; &quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this would only do `90 llo` \r\n\r\nwhat did I miss?? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**edit:**\r\nI typed it again so I could help others to read my problematic code easier, but I guess I didn&#39;t do the good job.

In the [CodeIgniter documentation for Query Builder][1] states that you need to do `$this-&gt;db-&gt;select(&#39;title, content, date&#39;);\r\n$query = $this-&gt;db-&gt;get(&#39;mytable&#39;);` , from what I see on your post, you have tried only the first part without specifying the table that you&#39;re trying to use.\r\n 3. Please try to give your question a better format, that query can be displayed in a better way, just hit some SHIFT + ENTER on keywords like  REPLACE or you can do it in commas, then with that formatting just select all the text and click on the {} which is to give code format to a text.\r\n 4. If you try the approach of MySQL query syntax I recommend the follwing:`$query = &quot;Your query&quot;;\r\necho $query;` if you do that, you will be able to debbug the query more easily, is even better if you combine it with the 1 item I listed (trying the query on a program like phpmyadmin).  Sometimes my queries won&#39;t work because of miss placed &#39;&#39;, &quot;&quot;, commas,etc and if I use echo, I can see how my query is going to run before performing the actual query.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/database/query_builder.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108952/how-to-convert-mysql-query-to-codeigniter-syntax/58109467#58109467","title":"How to convert MySQL Query to CodeIgniter Syntax?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12122440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10220526248012715/picture?type=large","display_name":"Lara Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12122440/lara-smith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569627514,"creation_date":1569627514,"answer_id":58142262,"question_id":58108952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58142262","body_markdown":"Finally I was able to convert it!

I edited the example in the TensorFlow documentation using canned estimators and was unable to use any tf.keras.optimizer() to do training with multiple estimator.train(...) calls. Your code will likely run without specifying an optimizer, but I&#39;m not sure what learning rate or optimizer is used in that case... \r\n\r\nI just opened this as an issue on the TF github. See here for updates:\r\nhttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/33358\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to get going immediately, you could downgrade your code to TF 1.x so that you can roughly match the version of the google machine learning crash course. \r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re feeling more ambitious, the TF team recommends starting to learn TensorFlow with Keras. From the documentation page about premade Estimators:\r\n&gt;Note that in TensorFlow 2.0, the [Keras API](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) can accomplish many of these same tasks, and is believed to be an easier API to learn. If you are starting fresh, we would recommend you start with Keras. For more information about the available high level APIs in TensorFlow 2.0, see [Standardizing on Keras](https://medium.com/tensorflow/standardizing-on-keras-guidance-on-high-level-apis-in-tensorflow-2-0-bad2b04c819a).\r\n\r\nEdit: An option to monitor training that would be low effort would be to use [tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/get_started). The changes to your code would be to:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the looping. \r\n\r\n2. Add model_dir parameter to find logs.\r\n```python\r\ndnn_regressor = tf.estimator.DNNRegressor(\r\n    feature_columns = construct_feature_columns(samples),\r\n    hidden_units = hidden_units,\r\n    optimizer = my_optimizer,\r\n    model_dir = /tmp/log_dir\r\n  )\r\n```\r\n 3. Open TensorBoard with (the reload_multifile option might not be necessary):\r\n```\r\n%load_ext tensorboard\r\n%tensorboard --logdir &#39;/tmp/log_dir&#39; --reload_multifile=true\r\n```\r\n\r\nTensorBoard is defaulted to update every 30 seconds, but you could update faster if you wanted to monitor training more closely. This tool is also very cool if you want to explore what the model looks like in more detail!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108945/cannot-do-incremental-training-with-dnnregressor/58385419#58385419","title":"Cannot do incremental training with DNNRegressor"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":642979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07643e75883ca442385d4c97be8facfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Benjaliu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/642979/benjaliu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":642979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07643e75883ca442385d4c97be8facfa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Benjaliu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/642979/benjaliu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58385419,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571868041,"creation_date":1569466429,"last_edit_date":1569470647,"question_id":58108945,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58108945","body_markdown":"I try to write a learning case according to google&#39;s course which uses DNNRegressor to setup a neural nets(intro_to_neural_nets).

But these answers are not quite what I am looking for.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108941/using-flask-web-app-to-read-write-to-the-serial-ports-of-a-client","title":"Using Flask web app to read/write to the serial ports of a client"},{"tags":["google-sheets","array-formulas","google-sheets-query"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":398,"user_id":11388717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h10Nc5-Litw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpA/f1-P5sM445A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Trey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11388717/trey"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508558,"post_id":58111308,"comment_id":102627330,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108938/fill-google-sheets-query-down-column/58111308#comment102627330_58111308"},{"owner":{"reputation":12778,"user_id":3889423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/llZ6I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JPV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3889423/jpv"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":398,"user_id":11388717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-h10Nc5-Litw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpA/f1-P5sM445A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Trey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11388717/trey"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513171,"post_id":58111308,"comment_id":102629794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108938/fill-google-sheets-query-down-column/58111308#comment102629794_58111308"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12778,"user_id":3889423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/llZ6I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JPV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3889423/jpv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12778,"user_id":3889423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/llZ6I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JPV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3889423/jpv"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569513128,"last_edit_date":1569513128,"creation_date":1569481700,"answer_id":58111308,"question_id":58108938,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58111308","body_markdown":"You can get all, with this single formula\r\n\r\n    =ArrayFormula(query({&#39;Report: Materials List&#39;!B9:C, &#39;Report: Materials List&#39;!E9:E * &#39;Report: Materials List&#39;!G9:G}, &quot;Select Col1, Col2, sum(Col3) where Col1 &lt;&gt;&#39;&#39;

The only think I would say is that it&#39;s returning a list of presence state for all endpoints registered for the sip address. What you would normally want to use is the aggregated presence which is the overall presence used and displayed by all the skype applications.\r\n\r\nSo you would normally use:\r\n\r\n - **presence.AggregatedPresenceState.Availability** is the base availability\r\n - **presence.AggregatedPresenceState.Activity.ActivityToken** is the well known sub-state of the base availability like &quot;in-a-meeting&quot;, &quot;on-the-phone&quot;, etc.\r\n - **presence.AggregatedPresenceState.Activity.CustomTokens** is a list of locale strings of custom presence states as it normally defined by the custom presence xml setup in skype for the user.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of other information in there as well including all the other information the user can set like location (**EndpointLocation**) and note (**PersonalNote**).\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso what is usage is the queryResultHandler parameter (you pass in null in your example, which is fine).  This is called when the presence result becomes available.  This is useful when you give it the query a list of sip addresses of more than one.  The userCallback is called when all the presence results have come in (i.e. the whole operation is complete), which can take awhile and any failures will fail the whole call on the call to EndPresenceQuery.  The queryResultHandler will be called multiple times when each successful presence result comes in, so you get your results faster and you see all the successful results even though the some may fail and cause the EndPresenceQuery to throw.\r\n\r\nBeyond that you can also subscribe to a endpoint for presence changes if you want to be kept up to date on when a endpoint changes presence.  You have to be careful about the subscription as there are limits on how many a endpoint can have subscribed to them.  This is where you get into the subscription types of Polling and Subscribed.  Depending on the type of application you are writing depends on what type of subscription you need.  Typically you only want to subscribe to endpoints what you are displaying/using live at the time.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108936/getting-user-presence-using-ucma/58123097#58123097","title":"Getting User Presence using UCMA?"}],"owner":{"reputation":312,"user_id":5224564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fadd7fa279dca6645a98e6e03c23dd6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Terrance Jackson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5224564/terrance-jackson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569524098,"creation_date":1569466329,"question_id":58108936,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58108936","body_markdown":"I just need to give an email address and have the ucma protocol send back the user&#39;s presence from skype for business using C#.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have some tips on how to obtain the user presence in ucma?

I just can&#39;t seem to find any tutorials online that cover my specific need.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108929/how-to-make-a-leaderboard-from-a-mysql-database-using-php","title":"How to make a leaderboard from a MySQL database using PHP"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":391,"user_id":5363932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wv3M4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Ocampo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5363932/brian-ocampo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569468127,"post_id":58108924,"comment_id":102608312,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108924/why-does-my-code-print-different-then-it-returns-in-a-function#comment102608312_58108924"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":548,"user_id":8228980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c55dd52dc2debf8e29a759d89265ccbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Heladio Amaya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8228980/heladio-amaya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569466491,"post_id":58108940,"comment_id":102608017,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108924/why-does-my-code-print-different-then-it-returns-in-a-function/58108940#comment102608017_58108940"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":548,"user_id":8228980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c55dd52dc2debf8e29a759d89265ccbb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Heladio Amaya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8228980/heladio-amaya"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569466401,"creation_date":1569466401,"answer_id":58108940,"question_id":58108924,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58108940","body_markdown":"You are missing a return statement inside the if clause.

This is a signal worth 38K + samples over a period of 6 minutes of stair ascent. The parts where there is some **low frequency noise** are the times when the person **would take a turnabout** to get to the next flight of stairs (**and hence does not count as stair ascent**.)\r\n\r\n![][1] \r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\nThis is why I need to get rid of it for my deep learning model which only accepts the stair ascent data. Essentially, I only need the high frequency regions where the person is climbing stairs. I could do eliminate it manually, but it would take me a lot of time since there are 58 such signals.\r\n\r\nMy approach for a solution to this problem was modulating this signal with a square wave which is 0 for low frequency regions and 1 for high frequency regions and then to multiply the signals together. But the problem is how to create such a square wave signal which detects the high and low frequency regions on its own?\r\n\r\nI tried enveloping the signal (using MATLAB&#39;s envelope rms function) and I got the following result:\r\n\r\n![][2] \r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\nAs you can see the envelope rms signal follows the function quite well. But I am stuck as to how to create a modulating square wave function off of it (essentially what I am asking for a **variable** pulse-width modulating waveform.) \r\n\r\nPS: I have considered using high-pass filter but this won&#39;t work because there are some low frequency signals in the high frequency stair-climbing region which I cannot afford to remove. I have also thought of using some form of rising/falling edge detection(for the envelope rms function) but have found no practical way of implementing it.)

As user select the data and click submit data will be able to post in database. \r\n\r\n__below is the function that I used to call the data__\r\n```\r\n  List _listViewData = List();\r\n  \r\n @override\r\n  initState() {\r\n    super.initState();\r\n\r\n    // when loading your widget for the first time, loads country from db\r\n    _countryA();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n   void _countryA() async {\r\n    // gets data from db\r\n    final countryA = await CallApi().getData(&#39;countries&#39;);\r\n     var resBody = json.decode(countryA.body);\r\n    setState(() {\r\n      // converts db row data to List&lt;String&gt;, updating state\r\n      _listViewData = resBody;\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI just know how to call the data of country using dropdown in an alert button.\r\nI dont want it to be display in dropdown but instead in a list in flutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n__below is function that I called in the dropdown__\r\n```\r\nvoid _showDialog() {\r\n    // flutter defined function\r\n    showDialog(\r\n      context: context,\r\n      builder: (BuildContext context) {\r\n        // return object of type Dialog\r\n        return AlertDialog(\r\n          title: new Text(&quot;Select Country&quot;, textAlign:TextAlign.center,),\r\n           actions: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n            // usually buttons at the bottom of the dialog\r\n          \r\n            new FlatButton(\r\n              child: new Text(&quot;Close&quot;),\r\n              onPressed: () {\r\n                Navigator.of(context).pop();\r\n              },\r\n            ),\r\n          ],\r\n          content: new Column(\r\n            mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\r\n            children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n                  Expanded(\r\n            child: DropdownButton(\r\n                      items: _listViewData.map((item) {\r\n                        return new DropdownMenuItem(\r\n                          child: new Text(item[&#39;country&#39;]),\r\n                          value: item[&#39;id&#39;].toString(),\r\n                        );\r\n                      }).toList(),\r\n                      onChanged: (newVal) {\r\n                        setState(() {\r\n                          _mySelectionAr = newVal;\r\n                        });\r\n                      },\r\n                      value: _mySelectionAr,\r\n                  ),\r\n                ),\r\n            ],\r\n          ), \r\n        );\r\n      },\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, the conclusion is that I want it to be display in listview in the flutter popup not a dropdown in a popup. I just cannot figure out how to call all the list data of country in a list in popup include with the search function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108909/how-to-create-searchable-listview-in-popup-flutter","title":"How to create searchable ListView in popup flutter?"},{"tags":["jira-zephyr"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":337,"user_id":3664733,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41ca2dba2f4acf832d6a7d81034f0a7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"REdim.Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3664733/redim-learning"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571408382,"creation_date":1571408382,"answer_id":58452745,"question_id":58108908,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452745","body_markdown":"Depends on what you want to be doing with your tests.

QuestionBank().getQuestions(testCallBack);\r\n                Log.d(&quot;Main&quot;,  &quot;processFinished: &quot; + questionList);\r\n\r\n**Step 3:**\r\n\r\ncall this method from after the response from the server\r\n\r\n\r\n    public List&lt;Question&gt; getQuestions(TestCallBack testCallBack) { \r\n    \r\n     public void onResponse(JSONArray response) {\r\n     \r\n     testCallBack.callBack(questionArrayList); // pass your array list here\r\n     }\r\n     \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108880/why-this-code-shows-an-empty-array-list-even-though-i-added-elements-to-it-durin/58109719#58109719","title":"why this

Here I am in the early stage of building a web app with a simple login page. I am trying to make it so that when I click the login button, the onclick action in the html should call the `login_user` function to make a rest request to the backend api I already built.\r\n\r\nHeres the html and js function:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;username:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; name=&quot;username&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;label for=&quot;password&quot;&gt;password:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;password&quot; id=&quot;password&quot; name=&quot;password&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;button id=&quot;loginButton&quot; onclick=&quot;login_user()&quot;&gt;login&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n        function login_user(path, username, password) {\r\n            &#39;http://127.0.0.1:5000/&#39; = path;\r\n            document.getElementById(&#39;username&#39;) = username;\r\n            document.getElementById(&#39;password&#39;) = password;\r\n\r\n            let data = {username: username, password: password};\r\n\r\n            return fetch(path, {method: &quot;GET&quot;, body:                 \r\n                JSON.stringify(data)});\r\n        };\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, this won&#39;t make a request. I dont think the issue is within the javascript? I&#39;ve tried to make a more simpler function that would simply redirect me to the homepage at the onclick but that wouldnt work either.

If this isn&#39;t clear, I&#39;d suggest printing `num_occ_list`.\r\n\r\nOne option is to have num_occ_list store a pair: each element in the list along with its count.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n    num_occ_list = [(x,num_occurrence_lc(arr, x)) for x in arr]\r\n\r\nYou can then pull out just the original list element once you&#39;ve checked its count:\r\n    \r\n    odd_occ_list = [x for (x,z) in num_occ_list if z%2!=0]\r\n\r\nIf you run this, you&#39;ll see the result is `[4,4,4]`.  This is because you called num_occurrence_lc every time an element appeared.  Since you really just want to call it once for each unique element, you can transform the array into a set first:\r\n\r\n    num_occ_list = [(x,num_occurrence_lc(arr, x)) for x in set(arr)]\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#39;d suggest printing out num_occ_list to understand what this is producing.

It&#39;s nil, great:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThen after it&#39;s allocated... What, still nil??:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI wondered if it was being treated like a lazy variable somehow.  But it&#39;s not really nil, because it can be accessed:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nAfter searching for a while, I wondered if my build schema in Xcode didn&#39;t have its &quot;Debug executable&quot; flag set.  But it does.  I even cleaned and rebuilt the project with the flag off and on to be sure.  \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nWhether I view `booking` in the Variables View or enter `p booking` in the Console View, it shows up as nil.  \r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s going on here?  I need the predictability of debugging I had before this upgrade.  \r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nI distilled a simple way to reproduce the issue.  First, create an empty single-view project and add this to the top of AppDelegate.swift:\r\n\r\n    public struct Booking: Codable {\r\n        var start_time: Date?\r\n        var payment_currency: String = &quot;USD&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen add these lines to the application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:) func:\r\n\r\n    booking = Booking()\r\n    print(&quot;booking.payment_currency = \\(booking?.payment_currency ?? &quot;NULL&quot;)&quot;)\r\n\r\nSet a breakpoint as before and when running, notice that the debugger shows booking as nil even after being assigned, as in my original case.\r\n\r\n*Then comment out* the `start_time` variable, re-run, and notice that now the debugger shows `booking` having a value after being assigned, as one would expect.  \r\n\r\nSo it seems that Date variables, optional or not, in a struct like this make debugging confusing.

Sodium-Plus is asynchronous, so you can encrypt/decrypt more messages at once without bottle-necking your server.\r\n2. If you install [sodium-native](https://github.com/sodium-friends/sodium-native) alongside it, your code will be faster. (It automatically selects the best backend.)\r\n3. AES-CBC is *unauthenticated* and therefore vulnerable to chosen-ciphertext attacks. `sodium.crypto_secretbox()` and `sodium.crypto_secretbox_open()` is superior here.\r\n4. Your `generatepass()` function doesn&#39;t use a secure random number generator, but sodium-plus provides one.\r\n\r\nYour functions can be written as follows (using keys rather than passwords):\r\n\r\n    const { SodiumPlus } = require(&#39;sodium-plus&#39;);\r\n    let sodium;\r\n    \r\n    async function encrypt(text, key) {\r\n        if (!sodium) sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();\r\n        \r\n        let nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);\r\n        let encrypted = await sodium.crypto_secretbox(text, nonce, key);\r\n        return Buffer.concat([nonce, encrypted]).toString(&#39;hex&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n \r\n    async function decrypt(ciphertext, key) {\r\n        if (!sodium) sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();\r\n        \r\n        const decoded = Buffer.from(ciphertext, &#39;hex&#39;);\r\n        const nonce = decoded.slice(0, 24);\r\n        const cipher = decoded.slice(24);\r\n        return sodium.crypto_secretbox_open(cipher, nonce, key);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    async function randomString(length) {\r\n        if (!sodium) sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();\r\n        const possible = &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789&quot;;\r\n        let text = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        let r;\r\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; length; i++){\r\n            r = await sodium.randombytes_uniform(possible.length);\r\n            text += possible[r];\r\n        }\r\n        return text;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Wrap this in an async function for calling:\r\n    (async function () {\r\n        if (!sodium) sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto()\r\n        var text = randomString(50)\r\n        var key = await sodium.crypto_secretbox_keygen()\r\n        let aa=performance.now()\r\n        for (var i=0; i&lt;1000; i++) {\r\n            await decrypt(await encrypt(text, key), key)\r\n        }\r\n        console.log((performance.now()-aa)/1000)\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nNote that the incumbent benchmark is also a bit misleading.

In this case you&#39;re specifically interested in the sequence `,\\n)`, and we can let Perl find that for us as we read the file:\r\n\r\n    perl -pe &#39;BEGIN{ $/ = &quot;,\\n)&quot; } s/,\\n\\)/\\n)/&#39; input.txt &gt;output.txt\r\n\r\nThis portion: `$/ = &quot;,\\n)&quot;` tells Perl that instead of iterating over lines of the file, it should iterate over records that terminate with the sequence `,\\n)`. That helps us to assure that every chunk will have at most one such sequence, but more importantly, that this sequence will not span chunks (or records, or file-reads). Every chunk read will either end in `,\\n)` or in the case of the final record, may end not have a record terminator (by our definition of terminator).\r\n\r\nNext we just use substitution to eliminate that comma in our `,\\n)` record separator sequence.\r\n\r\nThe key here really is that by setting the record separator to the very sequence we&#39;re interested in, we guarantee the sequence will not get broken across file-reads.\r\n\r\nAs has been mentioned in the comments, this solution is most useful only if the span between `,\\n)` sequences doesn&#39;t exceed the amount of memory you are willing to throw at the problem.  It is most likely that newlines themselves occur in the file more often than `,\\n)` sequences, and so, this will read in larger chunks.  You know your data set better than we do, and so are in a better position of judging whether the simplicity of this solution is outweighed by the footprint it consumes in memory.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108791/multiline-perl-regex-replace-on-large-file-without-slurp/58109602#58109602","title":"Multiline perl regex replace on large file without slurp"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":281402,"user_id":589924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2cf53d5a3d25f95c0db4e025aed4153?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ikegami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/589924/ikegami"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281402,"user_id":589924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2cf53d5a3d25f95c0db4e025aed4153?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ikegami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/589924/ikegami"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569473417,"last_edit_date":1569473417,"creation_date":1569472742,"answer_id":58109650,"question_id":58108791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58109650","body_markdown":"Delay printing out the trailing comma and line feed until you know it&#39;s ok to print it out.\r\n\r\n    perl -ne&#39;\r\n       $_ = $buf . $_;\r\n       s/^,(?=\\n\\))//;\r\n       $buf = s/(,\\n)\\z// ? $1 : &quot;&quot;;\r\n       print;\r\n       END { print $buf; }\r\n    &#39;\r\n\r\nFaster:\r\n\r\n    perl -ne&#39;\r\n       print /^\\)/ ? &quot;\\n&quot; : &quot;,\\n&quot; if $f;\r\n       $f = s/,\\n//;\r\n       print;\r\n       END { print &quot;,\\n&quot; if $f; }\r\n    &#39;\r\n\r\n[Specifying file to process to Perl one-liner](https://stackoverflow.com/q/41742890/589924)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108791/multiline-perl-regex-replace-on-large-file-without-slurp/58109650#58109650","title":"Multiline perl regex replace on large file without slurp"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2349,"user_id":5379657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ab4a9ac2ee2c7a27f5d976d6a787970?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeff Y","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5379657/jeff-y"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2349,"user_id":5379657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ab4a9ac2ee2c7a27f5d976d6a787970?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeff Y","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5379657/jeff-y"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569509731,"last_edit_date":1569509731,"creation_date":1569507731,"answer_id":58118922,"question_id":58108791,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58118922","body_markdown":"This can be done more simply with just awk.\r\n\r\n```\r\nawk &#39;BEGIN{RS=&quot;.\\n.&quot;; ORS=&quot;&quot;} {gsub(&quot;,\\n)&quot;, &quot;\\n)&quot;, RT); print $0 RT}&#39;\r\n```\r\nExplanation:\r\n\r\n`awk`, unlike Perl, allows a regular expression as the Record Separator, here `.\\n.` which &quot;captures&quot; the two characters surrounding each newline.\r\n\r\nSetting `ORS` to empty prevents `print` from outputting extra newlines.

Or am I going to have to do all this in code?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108782/how-do-you-vary-for-traits-when-wr-and-hr-are-the-same-in-both-portrait-and-la","title":"How do you &#39;Vary for Traits&#39; when wR and hR are the same in both portrait and landscape?"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569465274,"post_id":58108781,"comment_id":102607781,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108781/function-to-apply-function-by-row-values#comment102607781_58108781"},{"owner":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569465874,"post_id":58108781,"comment_id":102607901,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108781/function-to-apply-function-by-row-values#comment102607901_58108781"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6201605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a456d453c6f3f2ce901ecab100ced816?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gmacd18","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6201605/gmacd18"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569530794,"post_id":58108781,"comment_id":102637531,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108781/function-to-apply-function-by-row-values#comment102637531_58108781"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6201605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a456d453c6f3f2ce901ecab100ced816?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gmacd18","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6201605/gmacd18"},"last_editor":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569465567,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569465908,"creation_date":1569464965,"last_edit_date":1569465908,"question_id":58108781,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58108781","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to rank values of one column of a `data.frame` based on values of another column of a data.frame.\r\n\r\nI can do this in a loop, but this seems like something that should be doable without a loop, perhaps with something from the apply family.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of using `mtcars`.

Bad SQL can be typically identified by:\r\n- long execution time (TOTAL_ACT_TIME)\r\n- high number of rows read (ROWS_READ) or even better, ratio of  ROWS_READ to ROWS_RETURNED (e.g. we expect SELECT * to read a lot of rows, but it will also return that many)\r\n- high ratio of data reads (POOL_DATA_L_READS) to index reads (POOL_INDEX_L_READS), which typically indicates query could benefit from better indexing.\r\n\r\nAn example query could look like this:\r\n```\r\ndb2 &quot;select local_start_time, application_handle, total_act_time, rows_read, rows_returned, pool_index_l_reads, pool_data_l_reads, substr(stmt_text,1,100) as stmt_text from table(mon_get_activity(null, -2)) where member=coord_partition_num order by total_act_time desc&quot;\r\n\r\nLOCAL_START_TIME    APP_HANDLE TOTAL_ACT_TIME  ROWS_READ    ROWS_RETURNED POOL_I_L_READS POOL_D_L_READS STMT_TEX\r\n------------------- ---------- -------------- ----------    ------------- -------------- --------------- -------\r\n2019-09-26-10.31.57    3640333       66633923      78863           629729             32               0 SELECT \r\n2019-09-26-10.31.57    2329627       66627534     225535           629729             32               0 SELECT \r\n2019-09-26-10.31.57    1019395       66613118      95760           629729             18               0 SELECT \r\n2019-09-26-10.31.57    3640332       66608933      32607           302242              4               0 SELECT \r\n\r\n```\r\n(of course there are more interesting metrics available, I&#39;ve just showed few)\r\nOnce you identify the query, you can include `EXECUTABLE_ID` column and use [`EXPLAIN_FROM_SECTION`][2] to generate explain.\r\n\r\n\r\nQueries that has been executed in the past and still are in package cache.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor those you can use [`MON_GET_PKG_CACHE_STMT`][3] and use similar counters as in 1. Note that this one contains cumulative metrics for all executions, so you might want to divide numbers by `NUM_EXECUTIONS` \r\n\r\nQueries that might be executed in the future\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nTo narrow down such queries you can use [`CREATE THRESHOLD`][4] and make Db2 collect diagnostics (`COLLECT ACTIVITY DATA`) or even access plans (`WITH DETAILS SECTION`) once specific query exceeds certain threshold (SQLROWSREAD, ACTIVITYTOTALRUNTIME etc). Moreover, you can automatically interrupt such queries (`STOP EXECUTION`).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0060766.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0056251.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.rtn.doc/doc/r0055017.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPGG_11.5.0/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0050563.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58108772/how-to-identify-toxic-sqls-in-db2/58115188#58115188","title":"how to identify toxic sqls in DB2"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":6370391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93cb1bc195ad44508eca405efced58f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sudersan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6370391/sudersan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569495024,"creation_date":1569464912,"question_id":58108772,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58108772","body_markdown":"We have an ask to identify the toxic queries that are fired in the database and kill them so that the application is not affected because of it.

This might not be necessary if you configure the operating system to not overcommit memory.\r\n- Make sure that the modification has observable effects so that optimiser doesn&#39;t remove it (calculate a sum or something).\r\n- Don&#39;t have an infinite loop that doesn&#39;t call any library I/O function, nor performs an access through a volatile glvalue, nor perform a synchronization operation nor an atomic operation. There&#39;s a language rule that allows the implementation to assume that one of those happens, and if your loop is guaranteed to not do them, then it might not happen at all because behaviour is undefined... Maybe `new int` within the loop is sufficient, since it is potentially throwing, and thus the loop may not be proven to be infinite, but I&#39;m not certain.\r\n\r\nThe operating system should

Continuing your example, how will `float` argument be handled? `func(double param)` will be chosen, but the generic template will be instantiated. Often the former is correct.\r\n\r\nMore generally, there are reasons to prefer non-template code. Templates must usually reside in a header,  which slows down compilation and exposes implementation to everybody. Templates cause more cryptic compilation error messages and are not supported by tools very well. E.g. Visual studio 2015 does not give intellisense info for templates.
