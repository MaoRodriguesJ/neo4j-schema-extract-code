So the .exe calls some method in the .dll and the .dll shows a window to the user.\r\n\r\nNow - The DLL is actually an Outlook Add-in we wrote.

These could come from OUR dll or from any other Add-in&#39;s Form Regions. Obviously I don&#39;t want to mess with *those*, so as I go through the list of child window handles I want to establish whether it&#39;s &quot;one of ours&quot; before sending any messages to it.\r\n\r\nSo the question is:\r\n**given a hWnd (IntPtr), is there a way I can establish that this hWnd belongs to MyLittleDLL.dll -

It&#39;s undefined behavior, but it is still quite possible.  If reading past the end of a buffer is a security risk, it&#39;s a security risk even if the buffer size is artificially enlarged to remove the undefined behavior.  Nor is any security risk removed by using a smaller buffer.\r\n\r\nBecause the memory is just about always still going to be there either way.\r\n\r\nSecond, almost every `malloc()` implementation doles out memory in chunks of discrete sizes.  That&#39;s done to satisfy the requirement that `malloc()` return memory [&quot;suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a pointer to any type of object with a fundamental alignment requirement and then used to access such an object or an array of such objects in the space allocated&quot;][1].  That means `malloc()` must return memory that starts on something like an 8- or 16-byte (maybe even larger) boundary - or something similar. There&#39;s also internal accounting done, again causing memory blocking into chunks.  See [glibc&#39;s `malloc()` for example][2].  Memory can also be chunked to help prevent fragmentation.\r\n\r\nWhat that means is if you call `malloc( sizeof( int ) )` to ask for a 4-byte chunk of memory, you **really** get, for example, a 16-byte chunk.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when you call `malloc( sizeof( int ) + 7 )`?\r\n\r\nRight - you actually get the same 16-byte chunk.\r\n\r\nSo why is allocating a buffer larger than you need a security risk?\r\n\r\nIn the real world it&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nYou can also look at it this way:  if allocating a larger buffer than needed is a security risk, not allocating that larger buffer relies on undefined behavior to always act in way to remove that security risk.\r\n\r\n**Bottom Line**\r\n\r\nAnyone who claims `malloc( sizeof( int ) )` is safe but `malloc( sizeof( int ) + 7 )` is a security risk **is implicitly assuming undefined behavior can be relied upon to remove security risks**.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s, umm, unsound.\r\n\r\n**Actual risk**\r\n\r\nThe actual security risk in the code - if any - is as @Peter noted.  The apparent risk is assuming the value returned from `get_int_from_network()` is valid.\r\n  [1]: https://port70.net/~nsz/c/c11/n1570.html#7.22.3\r\n  [2]: https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/malloc/malloc.c.html#1058","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482660/why-does-reading-less-than-the-given-buffer-size-cause-a-security-risk/58484796#58484796","title":"Why does reading less than the given buffer size cause a security risk"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":7254143,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd1973a2d09e620ed24bed38a0c9a969?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"120394999","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7254143/120394999"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571655487,"creation_date":1571647252,"question_id":58482660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58482660","body_markdown":"Basically I&#39;m presented with a question as follows:\r\n\r\n(paraphrased)\r\nWhat is the security vulnerability in this &quot;code&quot; assuming the functions are written in pseudo C\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction (input) {\r\n...\r\n   len = get_int_from_network();\r\n   buffer = malloc (len+7);\r\n   read (input, buffer, len);\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I really want to understand why this is such a big deal.

A buffer is being malloc&#39;d with len + 7 bytes and reading only len bytes.\r\n\r\nThe part I&#39;m confused about is that it shouldn&#39;t read more than it is supposed to and should only result in free space at the end of the buffer.

Which is why I have had to resort to pre-defining the value of vector b when the function is defined itself, like this:\r\n\r\n    theta &lt;- function(a,b) {\r\n    b= c(1,2,3,4)\r\n    angle &lt;- (180/pi)*acos( sum(a*b) / ( sqrt(sum(a * a)) * sqrt(sum(b * b)) ) )\r\n    return(angle)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem is, since I have 5 different dataframes where I have 5 different vector b&#39;s, I have to define the function each time with a new b before I apply it to a dataframe.\r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482620/r-applying-function-with-multiple-inputs-to-all-dataframe-rows-using-apply-fu","title":"R- Applying function with multiple inputs to all dataframe rows using &quot;apply&quot; function"},{"tags":["android","firebase","kotlin","nullpointerexception"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1569,"user_id":6387618,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5af475c8ce7bf4b9d300e40a4f9b6c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Morozov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6387618/morozov"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4469,"user_id":10271334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-2ijZhRVumwM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACes/Tjw_JgqObGI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jeel Vankhede","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10271334/jeel-vankhede"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571647555,"post_id":58482616,"comment_id":103296843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482616/get-kotlinnullpointerexception-when-open-initial-fragment#comment103296843_58482616"},{"owner":{"reputation":239,"user_id":5899024,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2104152a9dccf35032b3620cec36874a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Asad Ali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5899024/asad-ali"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571650047,"post_id":58482616,"comment_id":103298073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482616/get-kotlinnullpointerexception-when-open-initial-fragment#comment103298073_58482616"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1569,"user_id":6387618,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5af475c8ce7bf4b9d300e40a4f9b6c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Morozov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6387618/morozov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571647710,"post_id":58482691,"comment_id":103296919,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482616/get-kotlinnullpointerexception-when-open-initial-fragment/58482691#comment103296919_58482691"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11709724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/260ad59fda78bfba958cb034e9e70413?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thaer97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11709724/thaer97"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571647389,"creation_date":1571647389,"answer_id":58482691,"question_id":58482616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482691","body_markdown":"Firebase auth can&#39;t be initialized when an activity or a fragment is created as it takes time to become responsive.

But any try to subscribe to the stream fails now, with \r\n&gt; You provided an invalid object where a stream was expected. You can provide an Observable, Promise, Array, or Iterable. \r\n\r\nThis problem exists only when takeUntil is introduced. This is especially weird since I use TypeScript and therefore the Return Type should be safe.\r\n\r\nTo debug the problem I pasted the example from the [docs](https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/takelast.html)\r\n```\r\n/// RxJS v6+\r\nimport { interval, timer } from &#39;rxjs&#39;;\r\nimport { takeUntil } from &#39;rxjs/operators&#39;;\r\n\r\n//emit value every 1s\r\nconst source = interval(1000);\r\n//after 5 seconds, emit value\r\nconst timer$ = timer(5000);\r\n//when timer emits after 5s, complete source\r\nconst example = source.pipe(takeUntil(timer$));\r\n//output: 0,1,2,3\r\nconst subscribe = example.subscribe(val =&gt; console.log(val));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem persists. I checked my installed version of rxjs and yarn resolved it to 6.5.3. I checked the GitHub Issues of rxjs but didn&#39;t find any related issues.\r\n\r\nI suppose the problem lies within my environment and conclusively I included all of my depedencies:\r\n```\r\n &quot;dependencies&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;@grafana/toolkit&quot;: &quot;next&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@grafana/ui&quot;: &quot;latest&quot;,\r\n    &quot;@types/grafana&quot;:

LiveStreams {\r\n private streams;\r\n private stop$: Subject;\r\n\r\n constructor() {\r\n   this.stop$ = new Subject&lt;string&gt;();\r\n }\r\n\r\n getStream(target): Observable&lt;DataFrame[]&gt; {\r\n     const stop_id = this.stop$.pipe(takeWhile(id =&gt; id == target.streamId));\r\n     stream = this.rxStomp.watch(target.streamName).pipe(\r\n                finalize(() =&gt; {\r\n                    delete this.streams[target.streamId];\r\n                }),\r\n                map((message: IMessage) =&gt; {\r\n                    let content = JSON.parse(message.body).content;\r\n

You should embrace that.\r\n\r\nOne way to do it is as you already described:\r\n\r\n    Res1 res1;\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        res1 = Procedure1();\r\n    }\r\n    catch ....\r\n\r\n    Res2 res2;\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        res2 = Procedure2(res1);\r\n    }\r\n    catch ....\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can write the procedures in their own helper methods which handles their error handling:\r\n\r\n    private Res1 HandleProcecure1()\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            return Procedure1();\r\n        }\r\n        catch ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private Res2 HandleProcecure2(Res1 res1)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            return Procedure2(res1);\r\n        }\r\n        catch ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    var res1 = HandleProcedure1();\r\n    var res2 = HandleProcedure2(res1);\r\n\r\nUnless there are methods which need *exactly* the same exception handling, personally I prefer not to try and group them. Give each its own set `catch` statements, and write some helper methods which mean you avoid writing the same things inside each of them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482586/a-basic-question-on-try-catch-with-multi-catching/58482796#58482796","title":"A basic question on try-catch with multi catching"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11263562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c68ff85623ddcd80f7836b05bb8146c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Junyu Lu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11263562/junyu-lu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22200,"user_id":7132550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1063981417044495/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michał Turczyn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7132550/micha%c5%82-turczyn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58482782,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571647821,"creation_date":1571646991,"last_edit_date":1571647738,"question_id":58482586,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58482586","body_markdown":"I want to catch the exception threw at different steps. Look at the code below. Let us say each function `Procedure1`, `Procedure2`,... ,`Procedure6` may throw various kinds of exceptions (may overlap!). And if exception happened at step 1-3, I want to throw newly-defined exception `ex1` and step 4-6 `ex2`.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic void TestFunc(){\r\n\ttry{\r\n\t\tvar res1 = Procedure1();\r\n\t\tvar res2 = Procedure2(res1);\r\n\t\tvar res3 = Procedure3(res2);\r\n\t\tvar res4 = Procedure4(res3);\r\n\t\tvar res5 = Procedure5(res4);\r\n\t\tProcedure6(res5);\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch{\r\n\t\t// if error/exception occurs in step 1-3 throw exception 1\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch{\r\n\t\t// if error/exception occurs in step 4-6 throw exception 2\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI have read https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/try-catch but really did not get the point.\r\n\r\nIf all steps throw different exceptions, then I can catch different ones. But the exceptions for different steps may overlap. So I cannot really tell which step it is from the exception message. (Yeah, this is can be overcome by adding extra info on exception messages, but again I really do not want to modify other functions.)\r\n\r\nOne way I can think of is to break the `TestFunc` into two piece, but again I really do not want to do this as it breaks the integrity of the function.\r\n\r\nAnd if we break the steps into two `try`, the editor shows the message `res3 does not exist in the context`. This is reasonable as `{}` separates the context.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic void TestFunc(){\r\n\ttry{\r\n\t\tvar res1 = Procedure1();\r\n\t\tvar res2 = Procedure2(res1);\r\n\t\tvar res3 = Procedure3(res2);\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch{\r\n\t\t// if error in step 1-3 throw exception 1\r\n\t}\r\n\ttry{\r\n\t\tvar res4 = Procedure4(res3); // error, res3 cannot be found in the context\r\n\t\tvar res5 = Procedure5(res4);\r\n\t\tProcedure6(res5);\r\n\t}\r\n\tcatch{\r\n\t\t// if error in step 4-6 throw exception 2\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482586/a-basic-question-on-try-catch-with-multi-catching","title":"A basic question on try-catch with multi catching"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2112,"user_id":4742570,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0017a2bafead37c0b8dab5d6df77138c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jsheeran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4742570/jsheeran"},"edited":false,"score":15,"creation_date":1571647077,"post_id":58482585,"comment_id":103296631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482585/the-scanner-skips-0-beginning-of-the-numerical-input#comment103296631_58482585"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7699275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/423821897969742/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tanzim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7699275/tanzim"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2112,"user_id":4742570,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0017a2bafead37c0b8dab5d6df77138c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jsheeran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4742570/jsheeran"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571647298,"post_id":58482585,"comment_id":103296725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482585/the-scanner-skips-0-beginning-of-the-numerical-input#comment103296725_58482585"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":12222592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/035e2896c480dec73158cc0b3c2fc25f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shekhar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12222592/shekhar"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571647472,"creation_date":1571647472,"answer_id":58482709,"question_id":58482585,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482709","body_markdown":"    Scanner scanner=new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    \r\n    String id=scanner.next();\r\n    \r\n    System.out.print(id);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482585/the-scanner-skips-0-beginning-of-the-numerical-input/58482709#58482709","title":"The Scanner skips &#39;0&#39; beginning of the numerical input"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":424,"user_id":3894179,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c6b1c2c08d1075995cb780ee8a2e36e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3894179/andra"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571647576,"creation_date":1571647576,"answer_id":58482733,"question_id":58482585,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482733","body_markdown":"If you&#39;re capture, let&#39;s say 0001 to an integer, it will omit the zero because integer does not have any leading zero.\r\n\r\nIf I say &quot;Ten&quot;, is it 10, 010, or 0010?

  $Credential = [System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]::Empty\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThis will create a safe credential object where you can store your credential without hard-coding them into your

See also this link [How to Add Credentials To PowerShell][1].\r\n\r\nYou should then try to use \r\n```\r\nCopy-Item -Path $path -Destination $destfolder -Credentials $Credential -Force -Verbose -PassThru\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this does not work, please add your full error message and tell us which command breaks your code.\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nYou can also store credentials on your machine and then retrieve them from the Credential Manager.\r\n\r\n 1. Install and import the Credential Manager from the PSGallery \r\n\r\n```\r\nInstall-Module CredentialManager\r\nImport-Module CredentialManager\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Create a new account with `New-StoredCredential`\r\n```\r\n$cred = New-StoredCredential -UserName TestAccount -Password P@ssw0rd\r\n```\r\n 3. You can retrieve the credentials with \r\n```\r\nGet-StoredCredentials | where { $_.UserName -eq TestAccount }\r\n```\r\nThis object is now a secure-string type. This command and the next (Step 4) should be in your script to retrieve the credentials and convert them to a PSCredential object.\r\n \r\n 4. To create a PSCredential object enter:\r\n```\r\n$credentials = New-Object -TypeName System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($cred.UserName, $cred.Password)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you got a PSCredential object which you should be able to use for Copy-Item also as a script.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://duffney.io/AddCredentialsToPowerShellFunctions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482550/powershell-copy-item-into-shared-drive-with-username-and-password/58483213#58483213","title":"Powershell copy item into shared drive with username and password"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9298336,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4552cc0d18fa7add70ca523cc568e15?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eyad Alkhatib","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9298336/eyad-alkhatib"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571657556,"creation_date":1571646818,"question_id":58482550,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58482550","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using powershell script to copy files from local computer to a network shared folder\r\n\r\nthe code is working fine with no issues when there is no authentication is required for the shared folder.

 If student name is change then we need to execute update query, to update new student name.\r\n\r\nBased on that statement, you need to know more than simply if the two lists contain the same members. It seems to me that you should iterate through the first list and see if there&#39;s an updated name in the second list:\r\n\r\n    foreach (var student in studentList1)\r\n    {\r\n        var otherStudent = studentList2.FirstOrDefault(other =&gt; \r\n            other.SudentId == student.StudentId &amp;&amp; \r\n            !other.StudentName.Equals(student.StudentName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));\r\n\r\n        if (otherStudent != null)\r\n        {\r\n            // Update student record with student.StudentId to otherStudent.StudentName\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you could grab all the students with new names using something like the following:\r\n\r\n    var studentsWithNewNames = studentList2.Where(s2 =&gt;\r\n        studentList1.Any(s1 =&gt;\r\n            s1.StudentId == s2.StudentId &amp;&amp;\r\n            !s1.StudentName.Equals(s2.StudentName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)));\r\n\r\n    foreach (var newNameStudent in studentsWithNewNames)\r\n    {\r\n        // Update student with newNameStudent.StudentId to newNameStudent.StudentName\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr you could go fully linq and just do:\r\n\r\n    studentList2.Where(s2 =&gt; studentList1.Any(s1 =&gt;\r\n        s1.StudentId == s2.StudentId &amp;&amp;\r\n        !s1.StudentName.Equals(s2.StudentName, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase)))\r\n        .ToList()\r\n        .ForEach(student =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            // update student.StudentId with student.StudentName\r\n        });\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso note that you should not store `Age` as a property, since it&#39;s constantly changing. You should store `DateOfBirth`, and then present `Age` as a calculated field. And `Name` should be a `string` (note also that you don&#39;t need to repeat the class name in property names):\r\n\r\n    public class Student\r\n    {\r\n        public int Id { get; set; }\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n        public DateTime DateOfBirth { get; set; }\r\n        public TimeSpan Age =&gt; DateTime.Now - DateOfBirth;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482533/compare-two-list-using-linq-in-c/58483443#58483443","title":"Compare two list using linq in C#"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":701,"user_id":1366179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BvTkP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brett Caswell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1366179/brett-caswell"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571651417,"post_id":58483571,"comment_id":103298733,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482533/compare-two-list-using-linq-in-c/58483571#comment103298733_58483571"},{"owner":{"reputation":23820,"user_id":2052655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mWqp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rufus L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2052655/rufus-l"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571655232,"post_id":58483571,"comment_id":103300490,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482533/compare-two-list-using-linq-in-c/58483571#comment103300490_58483571"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23820,"user_id":2052655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mWqp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rufus L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2052655/rufus-l"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571655697,"post_id":58483571,"comment_id":103300712,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482533/compare-two-list-using-linq-in-c/58483571#comment103300712_58483571"},{"owner":{"reputation":965,"user_id":1421482,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dcf094d1751b3fd8a1bb9783c9e33c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"XamDev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1421482/xamdev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571726257,"post_id":58483571,"comment_id":103325703,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482533/compare-two-list-using-linq-in-c/58483571#comment103325703_58483571"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571650648,"creation_date":1571650648,"answer_id":58483571,"question_id":58482533,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58483571","body_markdown":"Like most LINQ methods, [SequenceEquals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.sequenceequal?view=netframework-4.8#System_Linq_Enumerable_SequenceEqual__1_System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable___0__System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable___0__System_Collections_Generic_IEqualityComparer___0__) accepts a `comparer` parameter which allows you to compare elements using different comparisons. \r\n\r\nYou can implement the IEqualityComparer&lt;T&gt; interface directly or inherit from [EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.equalitycomparer-1?view=netframework-4.8) :\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass StudentNameComparer: EqualityComparer&lt;Student&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public override bool Equals(Student st1, Student st2)\r\n    {\r\n        return String.Equals(st1?.StudentName,st2?.StudentName);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public override int GetHashCode(Student st)\r\n    {\r\n        return st.Name.GetHashCode();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis allows you to check for differences with :\r\n\r\n\r\n    var hasDiffs=studentList1.SequenceEquals(studentList2, new StudentNameComparer());\r\n\r\n\r\n[Except](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.linq.enumerable.except?view=netframework-4.8#System_Linq_Enumerable_Except__1_System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable___0__System_Collections_Generic_IEnumerable___0__System_Collections_Generic_IEqualityComparer___0__) has a comparer too.

The code is written using Pytorch.\r\n\r\nFor example when launching a script `train.py` in Slurm to train a model on 4 nodes with 4GPUs per node as below, what do the `srun` command do exactly? \r\n```\r\nsrun python train.py\r\n```\r\nIt is written in the documentation that `srun` is used to run a parallel job on cluster managed by Slurm. However, I would like to know what steps it performs. I imagine that it copies the script to 16 GPUs and each GPU will run the script at the same time. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nIf I use `torch.distributed.init_process_group()` in my script to handle multi-gpu training, how Slurm will handle the gradients collected from each GPU together with Pytorch? I assume that there is a master port (which is a GPU device in a node assigned by Slurm) that gathers the gradients. And all 16 GPUs in 4 nodes will transfer the gradients to this master port thanks to the `torch.distributed` package?

This &quot;Nearby&quot; feature effectively allowed delivery of proximity-based marketing and other information without the need to intall a third party app.  Predictably, this led to unwanted spam notifications which is why Google discontinued the feature in December 2018.\r\n\r\nAgain, you can still use the Google&#39;s Prioxinity Beacons API with your own third party app, but it still requires you to register your beacons will Google&#39;s servers, something that has few benefits given that Nearby no longer works for app-less notification delivery.  **The day will ultimately come when Google discontinues these services, and apps using Google&#39;s Proximity Beacon API will stop working. But Google has made no announcements suggesting they will do this any time soon.** Perhaps they will support these services for many years, but nothing is forever, and there is no guarantee.\r\n\r\nAlternative third party SDKs exist for beacon detection like the open source [Android Beacon Library](http://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library). It does not require server registration of beacons, has been around much longer, and will continue to work without any dependency on a company keeping a web service running.  This is an alternative if you are worried about Google discontinuing the closed source Google  Proximity Beacons API and dependent on specific Google web services.\r\n\r\nFull disclosure: I am the lead developer on the Android Beacon Library open source project.

you insist on using Bash, it has [associative arrays](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Arrays.html). I am not entirely sure how you would sort those in plain bash and using only bash sounds a bit complicated for this. Perhaps `awk` would work better?\r\n\r\nIn Bash instead of the original approach I would do this with a piping of:\r\n\r\n 1. `cut` (to select the column, as you&#39;ve already done)\r\n 2. `sort` (to sort the values so they can be processed with `uniq`)\r\n 3. `uniq -c` (to count the number of occurances of a single column value)\r\n 4. `sort -nr` (to sort by the number of occurances, descending order -- greatest first)\r\n 5. `head` (to get only the most frequent occurance)\r\n\r\nSomething along the lines of (untested):\r\n```\r\ncut -d \\; -f 4 input.csv \\\r\n  | sort \\\r\n  | uniq -c \\\r\n  | sort -nr \\\r\n  | head -1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need to filter out some lines, I would add `grep -v` after `cut`. No need to use conditionals, while loops, `read` builtin. The `\\` at the end of line tells bash that this &quot;line&quot; continues on the the next line.\r\n\r\nThe above is the what first occured to me. It can surely be optimized but then again, perhaps you should look for other programming languages or paradigms if this needs to be executed often and as fast as possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482444/how-to-find-which-field-in-my-csv-file-appears-the-most-using-a-shell-script/58482754#58482754","title":"How to find which field in my CSV file appears the most using a shell script?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":10922921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b76e2d125ea0a8c8edb1c636be094d0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.erome","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10922921/j-erome"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571652345,"post_id":58482792,"comment_id":103299191,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482444/how-to-find-which-field-in-my-csv-file-appears-the-most-using-a-shell-script/58482792#comment103299191_58482792"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4000,"user_id":4289380,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73c4c5f526ed9027b3ee1d0f0ddad3e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Corentin Limier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4289380/corentin-limier"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571647812,"creation_date":1571647812,"answer_id":58482792,"question_id":58482444,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482792","body_markdown":"Parsing csv files like this is painful.\r\n\r\nUse [awk][1] : \r\n\r\n    awk -F&#39;;&#39; &#39;# CSV delimiter set to ;\r\n        $4{ # This block will be executed if room value is not null\r\n            n_persons[$4] += 1\r\n            if (n_persons[$4] &gt; max){\r\n                max = n_persons[$4] #current max of employees per room\r\n                room_max = $4 #current room that has most employees\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        END{#this block is executed after reading the file\r\n            print room_max\r\n        }\r\n    &#39; &lt;file&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/tags/awk/info","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482444/how-to-find-which-field-in-my-csv-file-appears-the-most-using-a-shell-script/58482792#58482792","title":"How to find which field in my CSV file appears the most using a shell script?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":10922921,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b76e2d125ea0a8c8edb1c636be094d0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.erome","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10922921/j-erome"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571652387,"post_id":58482851,"comment_id":103299221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58482444/how-to-find-which-field-in-my-csv-file-appears-the-most-using-a-shell-script/58482851#comment103299221_58482851"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":12063049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c59293b8491c66c6a11d1412b29b016?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blubase","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063049/blubase"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571648032,"creation_date":1571648032,"answer_id":58482851,"question_id":58482444,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482851","body_markdown":"Counting the occurances of unique values is probably done best by using `uniq -c`.\r\nSo to count the entries for each room individually, you need to extract a list which contains the column `room`. `awk` is probably the best tool in the bash environment to do that.\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    input=&quot;x.csv&quot;\r\n    \r\n    awk &#39;{print $4}&#39; $input | sort | uniq -c\r\nthis will return a list with two columns.
