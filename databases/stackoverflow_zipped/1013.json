aim is to trigger the advanced filter macro when cell B2 changes (a part of the filtering criteria). B2 is linked to another cell(in another worksheet) which dynamically gets data from external sources. The problem I am facing is that the macro does not activate automatically. Only when I manually change something in B2 is the macro activated. Otherwise the old criteria remains in place. A1 to G1 has the 7 categories and A2-G2 has the inputs for the filter.

The only possible dynamic changes can be implemented by using ribbon callbacks. Unfortunately, the Ribbon designer available in VSTO add-ins doesn&#39;t provide all features of the Fluent UI, so you must switch to using a raw XML markup specifying callbacks you are interested in. See [Walkthrough: Create a custom tab by using Ribbon XML][1] for getting started quickly. Note, you can export your existing custom UI to a ribbon XML file.\r\n\r\nThe Fluent UI (aka Ribbon UI) is described in depth in the following series of articles:\r\n\r\n - [Customizing the 2007 Office Fluent Ribbon for Developers (Part 1 of 3)][2]\r\n - [Customizing the 2007 Office Fluent Ribbon for Developers (Part 2 of 3)][3]\r\n - [Customizing the 2007 Office Fluent Ribbon for Developers (Part 3 of 3)][4]\r\n\r\nTo refresh your custom UI you need to use the [IRibbonUI.Invalidate][5] and [IRibbonUI.InvalidateControl][6] methods that allow invalidating the cached values for all of the controls (or just a specified one) of the Ribbon user interface. So, when an item is chosen in one control you may force other controls to update its state and content.\r\n\r\nBasically, calling the `Invalidate` or `InvalidateControl` method you may force your ribbon callbacks to be invoked anew. For example, if an add-in writer implements the `getImage` callback procedure for a button, the function is called once, the image loads, and then if the image needs to be updated, the cached image is used instead of recalling the procedure. This process remains in place for the control until the add-in signals that the cached values are invalid by using the `InvalidateControl` method, at which time, the callback procedure is again called and the return response is cached.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDim MyRibbon As IRibbonUI\r\nSub MyAddInInitialize(Ribbon As IRibbonUI)\r\n    Set MyRibbon = Ribbon\r\nEnd Sub\r\nSub myFunction()\r\n‘ Invalidates the caches of all of this add-in’s controls\r\nMyRibbon.Invalidate()\r\n\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, you may find the `dynamicMenu` control helpful because it provides the `getContent` callback which gets an XML string that contains the contents of this dynamic menu. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/vsto/walkthrough-creating-a-custom-tab-by-using-ribbon-xml?view=vs-2019\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/aa338202(v=office.12)?redirectedfrom=MSDN\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/aa338199(v=office.12)?redirectedfrom=MSDN#dropdown\r\n  [4]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/aa722523(v=office.12)?redirectedfrom=MSDN\r\n  [5]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.office.core.iribbonui.invalidate?view=office-pia\r\n  [6]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/office.iribbonui.invalidatecontrol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301604/interacting-with-files-and-directories-on-vsto-word-addin-in-ribbon-cs/58303367#58303367","title":"Interacting with files and directories on VSTO Word addin in Ribbon.cs"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":12125348,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff9964bc5c0f2f40ed50188f3dc05e67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vlady Zautin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12125348/vlady-zautin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570621405,"creation_date":1570615082,"question_id":58301604,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301604","body_markdown":"Please help.

The docker: section takes a command tag that can be run at start up\r\n\r\n    - image: circleci/mongo:4.0\r\n      command: [--replSet,rs0]\r\n\r\nnow the mongo container will automatically start up as a replSet. However you aren&#39;t out of the weeds yet. You still need to run rs.Initiate(), and that must be run outside of the mongo container (since it is running the mongod server).\r\n\r\nWhenever you use `run` it relates to the first container, which in this case is the golang container. You need to install the mongo-cli in that container and then run rs.initiate()\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my case, I was running an Alpine docker container and resolved it with this code\r\n\r\n      - run:\r\n        name: &quot;Initialize Replica Set&quot;\r\n        command: |\r\n          echo &#39;http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.6/main&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/apk/repositories\r\n          echo &#39;http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.6/community&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/apk/repositories\r\n          apk update\r\n          apk add mongodb=3.4.4-r0\r\n          mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 --eval &quot;rs.initiate()&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever I think the circle:golang containers are running off of Debian. According to [this blog][1] it looks like you can run\r\n\r\n      - run:\r\n        name: &quot;Initialize Replica Set&quot;\r\n        command: |\r\n          echo &quot;deb http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian &quot;$(lsb_release -sc)&quot;/mongodb-org/4.0 main&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list\r\n          sudo apt-get update\r\n          sudo apt-get install mongodb-org\r\n          mongo mongodb://localhost:27017 --eval &quot;rs.initiate()&quot;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://tecadmin.net/install-mongodb-server-on-debian/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301553/creating-a-mongo-replicaset-in-a-circleci-job/58355466#58355466","title":"Creating a Mongo replicaset in a CircleCI job"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":8938654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d64c2e3be7e258a85a0ef4687b08439?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chris Shepherd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8938654/chris-shepherd"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58355466,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570892702,"creation_date":1570614909,"question_id":58301553,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301553","body_markdown":"I am trying to run integration tests in CircleCI on code that makes use of MongoDB Transactions.

.StandardCellOutline {\r\n          box-shadow: 3px 3px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\r\n          background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgb(0, 0, 0), rgb(20, 23, 32), rgb(34, 39, 54)), -webkit-linear-gradient(left, rgb(44, 46, 51), rgb(140, 147, 168), rgb(44, 46, 51));\r\n          background-image: -moz-linear-gradient( bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -moz-linear-gradient(left center, #2C2E33, #8C93A8, #2C2E33);\r\n          background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -ms-linear-gradient(left, #2C2E33, #8C93A8, #2C2E33);\r\n          background-clip: content-box, padding-box;\r\n          padding: 1px;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      .StandardCellOutline:hover {\r\n          box-shadow: 0px 0px 12px 1px rgba(001, 122, 204, 0.9);\r\n          background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgb(0, 0, 0), rgb(20, 23, 32), rgb(34, 39, 54)), -webkit-linear-gradient(left, #4674CD, #4674CD, #4674CD);\r\n          background-image: -moz-linear-gradient( bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -moz-linear-gradient(left center, #4674CD, #4674CD, #4674CD);\r\n          background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -ms-linear-gradient(left, #4674CD, #4674CD, #4674CD);\r\n      }\r\n\r\nBut after transpiling the code, it becomes:\r\n\r\n    .StandardCellOutline {\r\n          box-shadow: 3px 3px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\r\n          background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -ms-linear-gradient(left, #2C2E33, #8C93A8, #2C2E33);\r\n          background-clip:

background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -ms-linear-gradient(left, #4674CD, #4674CD, #4674CD);\r\n      }\r\n\r\nYou can see rules for Chrome and Firefox are removed. If I just change the order, and put the rule for chrome in the last, then that rule stays. So the problem is only the last rule is included and rest are removed.\r\n\r\n    .StandardCellOutline {\r\n              box-shadow: 3px 3px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\r\n              background-image: -moz-linear-gradient( bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -moz-linear-gradient(left center, #2C2E33, #8C93A8, #2C2E33);\r\n              background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(bottom, #000000, #141720, #222736), -ms-linear-gradient(left, #2C2E33, #8C93A8, #2C2E33);\r\n              background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgb(0, 0, 0), rgb(20, 23, 32), rgb(34, 39, 54)), -webkit-linear-gradient(left, rgb(44, 46, 51), rgb(140, 147, 168), rgb(44, 46, 51));\r\n              background-clip: content-box, padding-box;\r\n              padding: 1px;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n   \r\nBecomes\r\n\r\n    .StandardCellOutline {\r\n              box-shadow: 3px 3px 9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);\r\n              background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(bottom, rgb(0, 0, 0), rgb(20, 23, 32), rgb(34, 39, 54)), -webkit-linear-gradient(left, rgb(44, 46, 51), rgb(140, 147, 168), rgb(44, 46, 51));\r\n              background-clip: content-box, padding-box;\r\n              padding: 1px;\r\n          }\r\n\r\nI tried changing my target, module in the tsconfig to es2015, nothing worked.

The absence of the positive fact or a proving rule results in failure (or more accurately, &quot;lack of provability&quot;).\r\n\r\nSo if you only assert that `person(anna)`, then the query `person(anna).` will be true (succeed, or be provable), but `person(table).` will be false (fail, or is not provable) as expected. Also, the query, `person(X).` will only yield `X = anna` as expected.\r\n\r\nBy default, if you query `person(X)` and there are no persons defined, Prolog will give an error indicating that `person` is an unknown predicate. If you would rather that Prolog simply fails in that case, there&#39;s an option you can set (I know in SWI Prolog in particular, but I don&#39;t recall what the option is), or you can declare `person/1` to be a *dynamic predicate* if you plan to assert `person` facts into your database dynamically as the program executes.\r\n\r\nAs part of a predicate definition, you might want to indicate that a warm-blooded animal is a mammal but is not a person. In that case, you might have:\r\n\r\n    warm_blooded_animal(X) :-\r\n        mammal(X),\r\n        \\+ person(X).\r\n\r\nThis is a little contrived just as an example. In this case, you&#39;d more likely define `mammal` in terms of the characteristic of being warm-blooded, etc, rather than the other way around. But you get the idea... Note that the operator `not/1` is deprecated in favor of the ISO standard `\\+/1`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301544/how-to-make-a-negative-fact-in-prolog/58305447#58305447","title":"How to make a negative fact in PROLOG"}],"owner":{"reputation":200,"user_id":8993352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8yKIc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matthias Neubert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8993352/matthias-neubert"},"last_editor":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58305447,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570628439,"creation_date":1570614890,"last_edit_date":1570615006,"question_id":58301544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301544","body_markdown":"If I have a fact &quot;Anna is a person&quot; in PROLOG I write for example:\r\n\r\n    person(anna).\r\n\r\nBut what do I write if I have a fact &quot;table is not a Person&quot;.

that `labix.org/v2/mgo` is not maintained anymore, if you want to use `mgo`, use `github.com/globalsign/mgo` instead. Or the new, official [mongo-go driver][1].\r\n\r\n[`bson.ObjectId`][2] is a type having `string` as its underlying type:\r\n\r\n    type ObjectId string\r\n\r\nSo when you fill your object like this:\r\n\r\n    databaseQuery := databasestructs.Find{\r\n        ID: bson.ObjectId(request.FormValue(&quot;_id&quot;)),\r\n        MongoCollection: &quot;users&quot;,\r\n        Criteria: &quot;_id&quot;,\r\n        CriteriaValue: &quot;&quot;,\r\n        FindAll: false,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`bson.ObjectId(request.FormValue(&quot;_id&quot;))` is &quot;nothing more&quot; then a type [conversion][3]. You convert the hex object ID string to `bson.ObjectId`, but this is **not** what you want. You want to _parse_ the hex object ID. For that, use the [`bson.ObjectIdHex()`][4] **function**:\r\n\r\n\r\n    databaseQuery := databasestructs.Find{\r\n        ID: bson.ObjectIdHex(request.FormValue(&quot;_id&quot;)),\r\n        MongoCollection: &quot;users&quot;,\r\n        Criteria: &quot;_id&quot;,\r\n        CriteriaValue: &quot;&quot;,\r\n        FindAll: false,\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote that `bson.ObjectIdHex()` will panic if the passed string is an invalid hex object ID. Use [`bson.IsObjectIdHex()`][5] to check it prior to calling `bson.ObjectId()`. For details, see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53701764/prevent-runtime-panic-in-bson-objectidhex/53701933#53701933.\r\n\r\nIf you would use the official driver instead of `mgo`, you could use [`primitive.ObjectIDFromHex()`][6] function to create the `ObjectId`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n    id, err := primitive.ObjectIDFromHex(request.FormValue(&quot;_id&quot;))\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        // Handle error\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n    // If no error, you may use it:\r\n    databaseQuery := databasestructs.Find{\r\n        ID: id,\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver\r\n  [2]: https://godoc.org/github.com/globalsign/mgo/bson#ObjectId\r\n  [3]: https://golang.org/ref/spec#Conversions\r\n  [4]: https://godoc.org/github.com/globalsign/mgo/bson#ObjectIdHex\r\n  [5]: https://godoc.org/github.com/globalsign/mgo/bson#IsObjectIdHex\r\n  [6]: https://godoc.org/go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/bson/primitive#ObjectIDFromHex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301536/mgo-is-setting-objectid-to-objectidhex-which-doesnt-seem-to-get-read-by-mongodb/58301782#58301782","title":"mgo is setting objectid to objectidhex, which doesnt seem to get read by Mongodb"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":8503984,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2x9ia.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Malikiah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8503984/malikiah"},"last_editor":{"reputation":204107,"user_id":1705598,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTFoe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"icza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1705598/icza"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570619081,"creation_date":1570614834,"last_edit_date":1570616209,"question_id":58301536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301536","body_markdown":"I am trying to make a query using the ObjectId, and normally in mongodb you would do something like this\r\n```\r\ndb.collection.findOne({&quot;_id&quot;:objectid(&quot;5d9d90e5ed645489aae6df64&quot;)})\r\n```\r\nWhich this works when I do a normal query but in go lang it gives it the value of \r\n```\r\nObjectIdHex(&quot;5d9d90e5ed645489aae6df64&quot;)\r\n``` \r\ninstead which does not lead to a valid query.\r\n\r\ni have read through the mgo documentation many times trying to use\r\n```\r\nbson.ObjectId(&quot;5d9d90e5ed645489aae6df64&quot;)\r\n```\r\nbut it still makes it a hex which I don&#39;t understand.

It could be 5 or 50.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301529/how-to-create-a-chart-in-canvasjs-with-an-undetermined-number-of-y-axis","title":"How to create a chart in CanvasJS with an undetermined number of Y Axis?"},{"tags":["javascript","php","jquery","html","wordpress"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570615047,"post_id":58301527,"comment_id":102965689,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301527/how-can-i-make-my-javascript-work-with-wp-enqueue-script#comment102965689_58301527"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10951124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fade6b2e9065cddbe3707ab35e30d1a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raphael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10951124/raphael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616026,"post_id":58301719,"comment_id":102966197,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301527/how-can-i-make-my-javascript-work-with-wp-enqueue-script/58301719#comment102966197_58301719"},{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10951124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fade6b2e9065cddbe3707ab35e30d1a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raphael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10951124/raphael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616327,"post_id":58301719,"comment_id":102966338,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301527/how-can-i-make-my-javascript-work-with-wp-enqueue-script/58301719#comment102966338_58301719"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10951124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fade6b2e9065cddbe3707ab35e30d1a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raphael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10951124/raphael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616553,"post_id":58301719,"comment_id":102966452,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301527/how-can-i-make-my-javascript-work-with-wp-enqueue-script/58301719#comment102966452_58301719"},{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10951124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fade6b2e9065cddbe3707ab35e30d1a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Raphael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10951124/raphael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570687411,"post_id":58301719,"comment_id":102992782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301527/how-can-i-make-my-javascript-work-with-wp-enqueue-script/58301719#comment102992782_58301719"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"last_editor":{"reputation":204,"user_id":11901310,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qx9PM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Krishna Savani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901310/krishna-savani"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570687299,"last_edit_date":1570687299,"creation_date":1570615460,"answer_id":58301719,"question_id":58301527,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58301719","body_markdown":"You could do like this:  \r\n  \r\nI have worked on your question and i have make page home in admin panel then i have create page-home.php in theme folder then i have make header.php and footer.php and just include those files in page-home.php\r\n\r\n    1) header.php\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;\r\n    &lt;!--\r\n    \tParadigm Shift by HTML5 UP\r\n    \thtml5up.net | @ajlkn\r\n    \tFree for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)\r\n    --&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;head&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;title&gt;Paradigm Shift by HTML5 UP&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;

res.status(403).send({error: { status:403, message:&#39;Access denied.&#39;}});\r\n    }\r\n    next();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use the middleware like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nrouter.post(&#39;/store-detail&#39;, verify, hasRole([&#39;admin&#39;, &#39;moderator&#39;]), async (req, res) =&gt; {})\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301501/express-middleware-allow-access-to-only-admin-or-moderator/58301800#58301800","title":"Express middleware: allow access to only admin

part**\r\n\r\nFrom system architecture point of view, here is what I will do. \r\n\r\n 1. Instead of making network request inside the middleware everytime, store the user access level in a token (say jwt token). \r\n\r\n 2. The moment user login to the system, make a request to the backend, the backend will make request to db to retrive the details (which should consider access level) and encrypt the user details in token. Your token should contain the access level. \r\n\r\n 3. On every request, You will have token in the headers, de-crypt the token, and set the details of access levels (res.locals should be the ideal place to set tokens). \r\n```\r\n   const verifyUser = async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n        const token = req.cookies.userId\r\n        if(token) {\r\n          try {\r\n            const tokenVerficiation = await verifyToken(token)\r\n            res.locals.userId = tokenVerficiation.userId\r\n            next()\r\n          } catch (error) {\r\n            return res.status(401).send(`Invalid Access token`)\r\n          }\r\n        } else { \r\n         return res.status(401).send(`Not Authorized to view this.`)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n**Relevant part**\r\n\r\nSince you are setting `res.status(403).send({error: { status:403, message:&#39;Access denied.&#39;}});` it makes sense why it won&#39;t move to the next middleware. \r\n\r\nSince for an APi call you can `*Probably` send headers once\r\nAs suggested by **J&#233;r&#233;mie L** creating a single-new middleware would be the best approach \r\n\r\n    module.exports = function hasRole(roles) {\r\n      return async function(req, res, next) {\r\n        const user = await User.findOne({ where: { id: req.user.id } });\r\n        if (!user || !roles.includes(user.role) {\r\n          return res.status(403).send({error: { status:403, message:&#39;Access denied.&#39;}});\r\n        }\r\n        next();\r\n      }\r\n

is a rough example of one way to handle your problem. First thing, your `displayBoard()` methods is going to throw an `IndexOutOfBounds` error. I am guessing your board size is 9 and that makes `board[9]` out of bounds. Remember `Arrays` in `Java` are zero-based indexed. This means the last index is the array size - 1. Back to the problem -&gt; This program allows users to enter a number and press enter. It then uses that number to put the `X` or `O` on the board at that location. Remember `Arrays` are zero-base indexed so if you want the user to be able to enter a number from 1 to 9, the program must subtract 1 from each number entered. The `Listener` in this code is problably what you need to address your problem. It listens to what is typed in the input `TextArea`\r\n\r\n\r\n    import javafx.application.Application;\r\n    import javafx.scene.Scene;\r\n    import javafx.scene.control.TextArea;\r\n    import javafx.scene.input.KeyCode;\r\n    import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\r\n    import javafx.stage.Stage;\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     *\r\n     * @author blj0011\r\n     */\r\n    public class JavaFXApplication374 extends Application\r\n    {\r\n        TextArea taInput = new TextArea();\r\n        TextArea taBoard = new TextArea();\r\n        char[] currentBoardState = new char[9];\r\n        char turn;\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void start(Stage primaryStage)\r\n        {\r\n            taBoard.setEditable(false);//Don&#39;t allow user to alter board\r\n            turn = &#39;X&#39;;//Set who is going first X or O.\r\n    \r\n            //Set all the character to empty space.\r\n            for (int i = 0; i &lt; currentBoardState.length; i++) {\r\n                currentBoardState[i] = &#39; &#39;;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            displayBoard(currentBoardState);//Display initial board.\r\n    \r\n            VBox root = new VBox(taInput, taBoard);//Add input and board to the scene.\r\n    \r\n            //Use listener to update board state\r\n            taInput.setOnKeyReleased((event) -&gt; {\r\n                if (event.getCode() == KeyCode.ENTER) {\r\n                    String[] tempInput = taInput.getText().split(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n                    for (int i = 0; i &lt; tempInput.length; i++) {\r\n                        currentBoardState[Integer.parseInt(tempInput[i]) - 1] = turn;//Change the 0 based array to a 1 based array.\r\n                        //Switch turn to other player\r\n                        if (turn == &#39;X&#39;) {\r\n                            turn = &#39;O&#39;;\r\n                        }\r\n                        else {\r\n                            turn = &#39;X&#39;;\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n    \r\n                    displayBoard(currentBoardState);//display board after update.\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n            Scene scene = new Scene(root, 300, 250);\r\n    \r\n            primaryStage.setTitle(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);\r\n            primaryStage.setScene(scene);\r\n            primaryStage.show();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void displayBoard(char[] board)\r\n        {\r\n            StringBuilder boardString = new StringBuilder();\r\n            boardString.append(board[6]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[7]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[8]).append(System.lineSeparator())\r\n                    .append(&quot;----------&quot;).append(System.lineSeparator())\r\n                    .append(board[3]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[4]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[5]).append(System.lineSeparator())\r\n                    .append(&quot;----------&quot;).append(System.lineSeparator())\r\n                    .append(board[0]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[1]).append(&quot; | &quot;).append(board[2]).append(System.lineSeparator());\r\n    \r\n            taBoard.setText(boardString.toString());\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * @param args the command line arguments\r\n         */\r\n        public static void main(String[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            launch(args);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nThe board is kinda off but I was not shooting for perfection.

So, if you want to align two figures with, for example, different y-axis tick characters, the box size will change.\r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\n    data_a = [1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000]\r\n    data_b = [10, 10.1, 9.9, 10.05, 9.95]\r\n    data_c = [0, -0.0005, 0.00025, 0.00045, -0.00015]\r\n    \r\n    fig1, ax1 = plt.subplots()\r\n    ax1.semilogx(data_a, data_b, &#39;bo&#39;)\r\n    ax1.set_xlabel(&#39;x-axis&#39;)\r\n    ax1.set_ylabel(&#39;y-axis&#39;)\r\n    ax1.set_title(&#39;fig1&#39;)\r\n    plt.show()\r\n    \r\n    fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots()\r\n    ax2.semilogx(data_a, data_c, &#39;r*&#39;)\r\n    ax2.set_xlabel(&#39;x-axis&#39;)\r\n    ax2.set_ylabel(&#39;y-axis&#39;)\r\n    ax2.set_title(&#39;fig2&#39;)\r\n    plt.show()\r\n    \r\n    fig1.savefig(&#39;test1.pdf&#39;, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)\r\n    fig2.savefig(&#39;test2.pdf&#39;, bbox_inches=&#39;tight&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe output gives me two figures that are not the same in size in terms of the box. This is caused by the fact that the y-axis ticks of `fig1` are different in size to ticks of `fig2`. The difference is not great but whenever I add it in a document and align them, it is visible and thus annoying.\r\n\r\n* Is there a way to ensure that the aspect ratio (or rather the y- and x-axis) are independent of the number of decimals so that the box stays the same size?\r\n\r\nI have tried to play around with the aspect ratio and also used the same `figsize` without any luck.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301411/plot-size-changing-with-number-of-tick-characters","title":"Plot size changing with number of tick

That means that they can not be parsed by Jsoup, because Jsoup only &quot;sees&quot; the static code embedded in the page.  However, we can get the results directly from the API.  \r\n\r\nYouTube&#39;s autocomplete search results are aquired from a web service (provided by Google). Every time we add a letter in the search bar, in the background, a request is made to that service and the response is rendered on the page. We can discover such APIs with the Developer Tools of a browser. For example, I found this API with the following procedure: \r\n\r\n - Open YouTube in a browser.\r\n - Open the Developer Console. (Ctrl + Shift + I).\r\n - Go to the `Network` tab. Here we can find detailed information about our browser&#39;s connections to web-servers.\r\n - Add a letter in YouTube&#39;s search bar. At this point, we can see a new GET request to `https://clients1.google.com/complete/search`. \r\n - Click on that request and go to the box on the right,  where we can examine the request-response more carefully. In the `Headers` tab, we see that the URL contains our search query; in the `Response` tab, the response body contains the autocomplete results.\r\n\r\nThe response is a JavaScript snippet that contains our data in an array, and it can be parsed with Regular expressions.
