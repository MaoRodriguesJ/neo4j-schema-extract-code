(In this case, the native ID will not change even if you later remove the `name` property.)\r\n\r\n        MATCH (startTime:timestamp {name: &quot;Time Stamp&quot;})\r\n        RETURN ID(startTime);\r\n\r\n- You can get a node&#39;s native ID at the time you create it (as shown below), and then hard-code the native ID in the queries that need it. (In this case, there is no need to even specify a `name` property.)\r\n\r\n        CREATE (startTime:timestamp {time: 0239213021312})\r\n        RETURN ID(startTime);\r\n\r\nIf the native ID is, say, 123, then you can get the node later via:\r\n\r\n    MATCH (n)\r\n    WHERE ID(n) = 123\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the node might be deleted, then it will have to have some property with a unique value that you can query for.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221211/match-for-a-node-name-using-cypher-in-neo4j/58224032#58224032","title":"MATCH for a node name using cypher in Neo4j"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8625236,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0caf47a828b3b58eee75cdb51a5b3d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Niklas Wilke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8625236/niklas-wilke"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570155032,"creation_date":1570112665,"question_id":58221211,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221211","body_markdown":"I&#39;m wondering if it is possible to MATCH for a node by it&#39;s name.\r\nI dont want to match through properties, labels or connections.

 Is there a way to require a package and still get the descriptive error message (like in the first example) when its upstreams are not found?\r\n\r\nAs far as I understand, more &quot;native&quot; behavior of `find_dependency` would be to **not forward** `REQUIRED` keyword to the inner `find_package`, but check the result of that `find_package` *manually*, and emit appropriate message if it is FALSE.\r\n\r\nYou may submit feature request to CMake tracker about that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221190/cmake-find-dependency-does-not-respect-the-behaviour-in-the-package-documentatio/58222583#58222583","title":"CMake find_dependency does not respect the behaviour in the package documentation?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4128,"user_id":1027706,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff91cf16cbd51dad8e48e2799f97e811?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ad N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1027706/ad-n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2874,"user_id":3987854,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OV64v.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"squareskittles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3987854/squareskittles"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570118067,"creation_date":1570112605,"last_edit_date":1570113812,"question_id":58221190,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221190","body_markdown":"Following documentation regarding [CMake package creation][1], it is stated that:\r\n\r\n&gt;

Since the north pole ***IS*** ***true north***, one can not calculate the bearing from **location1** to location2 any longer in reference to a bearing ***to*** the north pole at **location1**, because **location1** ***is*** the defining location of ***true north***, so I imagine there is another reference that is used in such cases as the ***true north*** meridian in reference to which one can then determine the bearing to a **location2**.\r\n\r\nI would like to ***test*** the results of code snippets found online.  If I try to formulate or otherwise deduce the rules used for when **location1** is ***at*** the North pole, by running tests through that code I am attempting to test, this would require trusting that the code is already entirely trustworthy for all edge cases, and does not need tests to find problems with it.  See the problem with that?  As in navigation, the idea is to never trust a singular tool, but test results of one navigation method against at least one other method, looking for agreement within some reasonable range of difference in the results.  Same thing here.  So I&#39;d like to know the ***rule*** first, in reasoning, for the simplest calculation of a fwd az ***from*** a **location1** of the North pole.  That said...\r\n\r\nRunning some test data using geographiclib, or, its online calculator, using the wonderful contribution of CFF Karney, at:\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://geographiclib.sourceforge.io/cgi-bin/GeodSolve\r\n\r\n\r\nAn example:\r\n\r\nlocation1 lat1 = 90.0          lon1 = 0.0         North pole\r\n\r\nlocation2 lat1 = 46.94797400   lon2 = 7.44744700  Bern, Switzerland\r\n\r\n\r\nfwd azimuth of loc1 to loc2 = 172.55255300\r\n\r\nwhich happens to also be ( 180 - 7.44744700 )  or 180 - lon2\r\n \r\n\r\nBased on the fwd az solution(s) with some test data, such as Bern, Switzerland, it seems like the reference becomes the 180 degree longitude meridian, but I have not yet thoroughly tested this.  I would like to confirm this, and know the &#39;complete rule&#39; to apply, with simple math, on a sphere, since I do not require accuracy to the width of a hydrogen atom, on a wgs84 ellipsoid (even though that capability now is certainly wonderful).  Also, is it the same if **location1** is the South pole instead?  \r\n\r\nIOW, simply, what is the rule for simple math, addition or subtraction preferred (if possibly that simple), without a need for trig functions and without the need for a full implementation of any of the ***inverse problem*** coding solutions, for finding the bearing from one of the poles, to a **location2** that is not the opposite pole?  \r\n\r\nIs the calculation formula different from the South pole, or dependent upon the **location2** being in a particular hemisphere, such as the north, south, east or west hemisphere?\r\n\r\nKnowing this rule(s) will help me confirm and test further, in the spirit of the wisdom in this blog:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/30/find-help-online-mindfully-and-effectively/\r\n\r\nparticularly the section titled **Step3 : Write the Code**.\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n10-4-2019 Update:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nProgress after some testing, but with more testing to go.  The way I would previously think about this problem is that there are two locations, neither being at either of the poles.  One component of the solution result is the forward azimuth needed to get from **location1** to **location2** along a geodesic (great circle), that bearing being referenced to **true north**, **true north** being essential to the meaning of that result.  Where my thinking went wrong is to imagine that when **location1** is on the exact North pole, the value of **lon1** would be inconsequential, being now ***on*** the definition of **true north** itself, and in a sense, undefined, meaningless, useless.  But this is **not** true.  **lon1**, at the North pole, is very important, because when **location1** is the North pole, the results of the *Inverse problem*, regarding forward azimuth from **location1**, *means something different*, and is still a very useful result, as long as one understands its different meaning at the unique case of the North pole, and how to make use of it.  That result no longer means the azimuth to **location2** in reference to **true north**, but instead means:\r\n\r\n\r\n*... how much one needs to change one&#39;s current heading from the one currently on, in order to then be traveling along the longitude meridian that is the geodesic to* **location2** *, (which is simply the value of **lon2**).*  \r\n\r\nAnd how does one specify the heading one is on when at the North pole?  By the **lon1** specified with the **lat1** of 90.0.  That **lon1** indicates, in my tests and rule formulation, the longitude meridian at one&#39;s back, the heading then being 180 degrees from that.  With that concept in mind, I am testing three rules, and will post them after some thorough tests to confirm them.  So then, the **lon1** is not useless or undefined at the North pole, but, in the popular *inverse problem* solution tools, is actually quite useful in the result it returns for the bearing, as long as one understands this different significance of **lon1** when **location1** is the North pole.  It is a mistake to put any random value into **lon1**, thinking it doesn&#39;t matter.  To do that would make the fwd az result for **location1** seem unusably meaningless.  It is, in fact, very meaningful, very useful, and just as accurate as when **location1* is not the North pole.  Now on to more tests.  I thought this update might be useful until my testing is finished, particularly since no one has yet posted any type of response.\r\n\r\nUpdate 10-10-2019\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe first Rule, Rule 1, is now confirmed with testing.  These rules suggest a way of envisioning what the ***inverse problem*** solution tool&#39;s result means when **Location1** is the special case of the North pole.  Another Rule is being tested.  When it is confirmed, I will post the confirmed Rules as an answer to my own question, moving it from this OP, and further trimming down the OP.  I remain very open to thoughts from others, even if you do not have a production worthy *solution* to share.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrewriting...\r\n```\r\n\r\nComments encouraged...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221183/how-does-one-calculate-a-forward-azimuth-from-exactly-the-north-pole-as-location","title":"How does one calculate a forward azimuth from exactly the north pole as location1, as a special case, to another non-pole location2 (lat2 lon2)?"},{"tags":["ios","itunes-store"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":75505,"user_id":3418066,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/De72L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paulw11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3418066/paulw11"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570132725,"creation_date":1570132725,"answer_id":58226106,"question_id":58221178,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58226106","body_markdown":"There is no method to correlate the customers details with your transaction details.

default fields aren&#39;t allowed to be empty, so that&#39;s the expected behavior and you&#39;ll have to explicitly allow empty values.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve what you&#39;re trying to do, instead of using an additional rule, you should customize the `allowEmpty()` rule, use the second argument to supply a callback (note that unlike rule callbacks it will receive a single argument that provides the context).\r\n\r\nSo you&#39;d do something like this, which you may need to modify a bit, for example depending on whether you need it to work differently for creating (`$context[&#39;newRecord&#39;] = true`) and updating (`$context[&#39;newRecord&#39;] = false`) records:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n-&gt;allowEmpty(\r\n\t&#39;license_nr&#39;,\r\n\tfunction ($context)

supplied&quot;\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs of CakePHP 3.7 you can use `allowEmptyString()`, it will work the same way, you just need to swap the second and third arguments, as `allowEmptyString()` takes the message as the second argument, and the callback as the third argument.\r\n\r\nSee also\r\n\r\n* **[Cookbook &gt; Validation &gt; Conditional

UPDATED**: I found out more information and therefor changed my question.\r\n\r\nI want to save my user with his license number, but only if he selects that he has a license. I have three possible values for the `pilot_type` field (ROC, ROC-light and recreative) and only the last option should allow for an empty string to be submitted.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve this, I wrote the following validation function:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$validator\r\n    -&gt;add(&#39;license_nr&#39;, &#39;present_if_license&#39;, [\r\n        &#39;rule&#39; =&gt; function ($value, $context) {\r\n            return $context[&#39;data&#39;][&#39;pilot_type&#39;] == &#39;recreative&#39; || !empty($value);\r\n        },\r\n        &#39;message&#39; =&gt; &quot;If you don&#39;t fly recreatively, a license number needs to be supplied&quot;\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that setting any validation rule on a field will trigger an additional check in the CakePHP Model class that will reject the value if it&#39;s empty. I tried to fix this by adding `-&gt;allowEmpty(&#39;license_nr&#39;)`, but that rule makes for the model to accept an empty string without even running my custom function. Even putting them in order and using `&#39;last&#39; =&gt; true` on my custom rule doesn&#39;t resolve this problem:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$validator\r\n    -&gt;add(&#39;license_nr&#39;, &#39;present_if_license&#39;, [\r\n        &#39;rule&#39; =&gt; function ($value, $context) {\r\n            return false;\r\n            // return $context[&#39;data&#39;][&#39;pilot_type&#39;] == &#39;recreative&#39; || !empty($value);\r\n        },\r\n        &#39;last&#39; =&gt; true,\r\n        &#39;message&#39; =&gt; &quot;If you don&#39;t fly recreatively, a license number needs to be supplied&quot;\r\n    ])\r\n    -&gt;allowEmpty(&#39;license_nr&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do I make CakePHP run my custom function in order to see if the field can be empty, rather than just assuming that it can never be empty or must always be empty?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221154/how-to-have-a-cakephp-model-field-requirement-checked-manually","title":"How to have a CakePHP model field requirement checked manually?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","arima"],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":2417922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cee40c36bc502473b0976b339a8b8da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Lavin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2417922/mark-lavin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570112455,"creation_date":1570112455,"question_id":58221153,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221153","body_markdown":"In Python 3.7, I have a time series represented by a Pandas dataframe in which the index is a DateTimeIndex and the single value column is stock price:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe gaps correspond to NaN &quot;price&quot; values, and there are 126 non-NaN values and 20 NaN values.  What I&#39;m trying to do is to interpolate the non-NaN values to predict the values that are NaN.  I tried several interpolation methods (linear, cubic spline) but they&#39;re not sufficiently accurate, and looking at the plot above, it appears there is a significant upward trend and also some traces of weekly periodicity, so I decided to use statsmodel ARIMA.  Here is my code:\r\n\r\n    def fill_in_dataframe_ARIMA(  df ):\r\n        price_is_not_NaN = df[ &#39;price&#39; ].notnull()\r\n        price_is_NaN = np.logical_not( price_is_not_NaN )\r\n        # Convert the datetimes of the index into milliseconds:\r\n        datetime_ms = df.index.map( to_ms )\r\n        # Train the ARIMA model:\r\n        train_datetime_ms = datetime_ms[ price_is_not_NaN ]\r\n        train_price = df.price[ price_is_not_NaN ]\r\n        arima_model = ARIMA( train_price, ( 5, 1, 2 ), train_datetime_ms ).fit()\r\n        # Use model to predict the missing prices:\r\n        missing_datetime_ms = datetime_ms[ price_is_NaN ]\r\n        missing_price = arima_model.predict( exog = missing_datetime_ms )\r\n        return missing_price\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m expecting is that ```missing_price``` ends up being an array-like object of twenty entries, like ```missing_datetime_ms```.  Instead, ```missing_price``` has 125 entries, one fewer than the number of samples in ```train_datetime_ms:train_price```.\r\n\r\nClearly I am not understanding what&#39;s meant by *endogenous* and *exogenous* (not to mention *interpolate* vs. *extrapolate*).  Can someone please explain how I can get the intended result of 20 predicted entries?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

ckoverflow.com/a/58228900","body_markdown":"As I explained to you in my comments to the [other question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/58170627/1082681), Spring AOP can use both CGLIB and JDK proxies depending on the situation. The default are JDK proxies for classes implementing interfaces, but you can enforce CGLIB usage for them too. For classes not implementing interfaces only CGLIB remains because JDK proxies can only create dynamic proxies based on interfaces.\r\n\r\nSo looking at your case 1, you explicitly say you want interface proxies, i.e. JDK proxies:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    @Scope(value = &quot;prototype&quot;, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)\r\n\r\nBut `MyBeanA` does not implement any interfaces. Consequently you get the error message you see in this case.\r\n\r\nIn case 2 however you use `ApplicationContext.getBean(..)` in order to create a proxy. Here you are relying on Spring to determine which proxy type to choose, you are not trying to enforce anything. Thus, proxying via CGLIB succeeds.\r\n\r\nNo surprises here.\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid the error message in case 1, maybe you ought to use `ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update:** Sorry, I was irritated by your similar and nondescript class names `MyBeanA` and `MyBeanB`. It would make sense to use more descriptive, clean-code-like class names next time, ideally ones describing the roles ob the classes in your scenario like `MyService`, `MyInterface`, `MyScopedBean`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I read your question and the error message again. The error message says that according to your annotation an interface-based proxy is being generated but you are trying to inject it into a class type. You can fix that by declaring it like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private MyBeanBInterface myBeanB;\r\n\r\nIn case/usage 2 you are again explicitly declaring a class and not an interface type for your bean. So as I said, Spring tries to satisfy your requirement by the only way possible, i.e. creating a CGLIB proxy for the class. You can fix this by declaring an interface type and you will get the expected JDK proxy:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    MyBeanBInterface myBeanBInterface = appContext.getBean(MyBeanBInterface.class);\r\n    System.out.println(myBeanBInterface.getCounter());\r\n    System.out.println(myBeanBInterface.getClass());\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Update 2:** Something I think you still do not understand according to your comments is this basic fact of OOP: If you have\r\n\r\n* class `Base` and class `Sub extends Base` or\r\n* interface `Base` and class `Sub implements Base`\r\n\r\nyou can declare `Base b = new Sub()` but of course not `Sub s = new Base()` because a `Sub` is also a `Base`, but not every `Base` is a `Sub`. For example, if you also have `OtherSub extends Base`, when trying to assign a `Base` object to a `Sub` variable it could be an `OtherSub` instance. This is why this does dot even compile without using `Sub s = (Sub) myBaseObject`.\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. Now look at your code again:\r\n\r\nIn **usage 1** you have `@Autowired private MyBeanB myBeanB;` but configured `MyBeanB` to produce a JDK proxy, i.e. a new proxy class with parent class `Proxy` directly implementing `MyBeanBInterface` will be created. I.e. you have two different classes, both directly implementing the same interface. Those classes are assignment-incompatible to each other for the reason I explained above. With regard to the interface we have the class hierarchy\r\n\r\n```none\r\nMyBeanBInterface\r\n  MyBeanB\r\n  MyBeanB_JDKProxy\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus you cannot inject `MyBeanB_JDKProxy` into a `MyBeanB` field because a proxy object is not an instance of `MyBeanB`. Don&#39;t you understand? The problem sits in front of the computer, there is no mysterious Spring bug. You configured it to fail.\r\n\r\nThis is why I told you to change the code to `@Autowired private MyBeanBInterface myBeanB;` because then of course it works because the proxy implements the interface and everything is fine. I also told you that alternatively you can keep `@Autowired private MyBeanB myBeanB;` if you use `proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.TARGET_CLASS` for your scope declaration.\r\n\r\nIn **usage 2** the problem is the same: You are saying `getBean(ClassB.class)`, i.e. you are explicitly instructing Spring to create a proxy for that class. But for a class you cannot create a JDK proxy, only a CGLIB proxy, which is what Spring does. Again, I gave you the solution by instructing you to use `getBean(MyBeanBInterface.class)` instead. Then you get the expected JDK proxy.\r\n\r\nSpring is smart enough to both\r\n\r\n* make the JDK proxy in usage 1 find the scoped service bean `MyClassB` and delegate method calls to it (note: delegation, not inheritance!) and\r\n* make the CGLIB proxy extend `MyClassB` (note: inheritance here, no delegation necessary).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221152/why-dont-i-experience-any-exception-when-i-lookup-bean-wrapped-by-jdk-dynamic-p/58228900#58228900","title":"Why don&#39;t I experience any exception when I lookup bean wrapped by JDK dynamic proxy by class(instead of interface)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11188,"user_id":2674303,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/411d782b77899035a96abb71b64e062a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gstackoverflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2674303/gstackoverflow"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":155,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570590735,"creation_date":1570112453,"last_edit_date":1570183837,"question_id":58221152,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221152","body_markdown":"Lets consider following bean:\r\n\r\n    @Service\r\n    @Scope(value = &quot;prototype&quot;, proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)\r\n    public class MyBeanB implements MyBeanBInterface {\r\n        private static final AtomicLong COUNTER = new AtomicLong(0);\r\n    \r\n        private Long index;\r\n    \r\n        public MyBeanB() {\r\n            index = COUNTER.getAndIncrement();\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;constructor invocation:&quot; + index);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Transactional \r\n        @Override\r\n        public long getCounter() {\r\n            return index;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand consider 2 different usages:\r\n\r\n\r\nUSAGE 1:\r\n-\r\n\r\n    @Service\r\n    public class MyBeanA {\r\n        @Autowired\r\n        private MyBeanB myBeanB;   \r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAt this case application can&#39;t be started and prints:\r\n\r\n    ***************************\r\n    APPLICATION FAILED TO START\r\n    ***************************\r\n    \r\n    Description:\r\n    \r\n    The bean &#39;myBeanB&#39; could not be injected as a &#39;my.pack.MyBeanB&#39; because it is a JDK dynamic proxy that implements:\r\n    \tmy.pack.MyBeanBInterface\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Action:\r\n    \r\n    Consider injecting the bean as one of its interfaces or forcing the use of CGLib-based proxies by setting proxyTargetClass=true on @EnableAsync and/or @EnableCaching.\r\n\r\nI expected to see it because I asked spring to create JDK dynamic proxy for bean `MyBeanB` and that proxy is not a subtype of MyBeanB.

I couldn&#39;t find one so I&#39;ve tried a really convoluted way, reading the .dat file into a string and manually chopping off the top of part of the file and saving the rest as .dat file. My hope is to then somehow be able to save the result as a .csv or .xls but I still can&#39;t find how to do that either. Furthermore after importing the tabulation is converted to \\t&#39;s and this doesn&#39;t go back to tabulation in the saved files.

I contacted the theme creator and was told that it&#39;s customization (not included w/theme) and advised to hard code text into the php. The problem with that is it&#39;s not accessible to other users who have no design or code background.. Is there a way to create a page with editable content block for this People section so it&#39;s easily editable without knowing code?\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, the “People” header text changes if you click on subcategories (to “Elected Officials”) for example. When you click a subcategory, the main menu (People page) no longer shows as active which can be confusing to users. Is there a way to fix this so header stays consistent (like Contact page header) and menu item shows active regardless of what subcategory(All, Elected Officials, etc) is selected on the People page?

with a *timeout*. The default timeout is 10 seconds, and the default action on timeout is to do nothing. So the commands waits 10 seconds, matches timeout, and returns, so we continue with the next command.\r\n\r\nYou can explicitly match for timeout:\r\n\r\n    expect {\r\n        -exact &quot;process returned with 0&quot; {}\r\n        timeout { puts &quot;timeout!&quot;; exit 1 }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo avoid the wait to timeout, you can use a regexp that will match whether `$?` is 0 or 1 (or other numbers).

If I rewrite the function to only return null it works, so I suppose the error is located in this function - maybe it has something to do with it being async?\r\n\r\nNameValidator class: \r\n\r\n    import { FirebaseService } from &#39;./../services/firebase.service&#39;;\r\n    import { FormControl } from &quot;@angular/forms&quot;;\r\n    import { Injectable } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n\r\n    @Injectable()\r\n    export class NameValidator {\r\n      constructor(private firebaseService: FirebaseService) { }\r\n\r\n      validate(control: FormControl): any {\r\n        return this.firebaseService.queryByUniqueNameOnce(control.value).subscribe(res =&gt; {\r\n            return res.length == 0 ?

Event 1 should precede Event 2 etc, per stream (Aggregate). EventStore will ensure this level of consistency by applying optimistic concurrency. You can provide an expected Stream Version (e.g. last Version written) when you write events to Event Store. When you read your stream of Events, you take the last Version number and you pass that along when you write Events to EventStore. If the event stream has grown since you last read, a concurrency error will be raised. \r\n\r\n&gt; Do I have to call the read-model? every time? in each event? each method of the aggregate? \r\n\r\nThere is some confusion of terms here. Keep in mind Events vs Commands, Read vs Write models, and what purpose each one serves. You display data from your Read model. You validate and process against your write model. \r\n\r\n&gt; What happen if the user sent it twice and the readmodel is not sync, yet?\r\n\r\nGiven the optimistic concurrency policy above, you essentially get a first-in-wins policy. To get past the issue, you can trap concurrency errors and reprocess your command from the beginning (getting the latest state from EventStore). \r\n\r\n&gt; Does it mean I have to call the EventStore each time I need to do something?\r\n\r\nYes. On each Command, you would read the Event stream for your Aggregate and restore state. You can use Snapshots as an optimization, but the concept remains the same. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221047/how-to-validate-the-event-flow-in-ddd-event-sourcing/58222915#58222915","title":"How to validate the event flow in DDD - Event sourcing?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26282,"user_id":54734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea91774321962f70f19362f43568cda9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VoiceOfUnreason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/54734/voiceofunreason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570141232,"creation_date":1570141232,"answer_id":58227611,"question_id":58221047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227611","body_markdown":"&gt; How to validate the event flow in DDD - Event sourcing?\r\n&gt; How do I know the stream is in a valid state?\r\n\r\nIn domain driven design, the domain model has the responsibility for ensuring that the state satisfies your domain invariant.  You can think of it as a function\r\n\r\n    everythingWeKnowNow = domainModel(everythingWeKnewBefore, newInformation)\r\n\r\nAs new information arrives, we integrate it with what happened before to produce a new version of &quot;the truth&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn a CQRS world, this is all happening in the &quot;write model&quot; - we&#39;re working from the authoritative representation of &quot;the truth&quot;, not a stale copy, and we modify it as requied by the domain.\r\n\r\nThe event sourcing part is really just a difference of representation: instead of computing a new state, then overwriting our previous copy, we compute changes, and append those changes to our previous (we can always recompute the state by simply enumerating over the list of changes).\r\n\r\nSo our _authoritative_ copy of the state always has the events that were computed by the domain model in the order in which they were written.\r\n\r\nThe broad pattern here is the idea that the model is the authority for the information in the system, and event sourcing is just a different way of storing that information (one that supports temporal queries).\r\n\r\nFor parts of the solution that need an authoritative ordering of events, the trick is that you retrieve them from the event store as an ordered sequence, _not_ by reading them one at a time and trying to reconstruct the sequence.  In other words, you&#39;ll use a pull model, rather than a push model, to communicate the events from one system to another.\r\n\r\nWhen you are working in a system based on a push model, and events may be mis-ordered, then you need to build that into your design.  This tends to happen in the form of tracking what information is missing, and waiting until it arrives.\r\n\r\n(You also have to pay more attention to _time_; message arrival time is a pretty lossy substitute for knowing when things happened).\r\n\r\nDistributed systems are _hard_, and the short cuts we learned when everything was local don&#39;t work any longer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221047/how-to-validate-the-event-flow-in-ddd-event-sourcing/58227611#58227611","title":"How to validate the event flow in DDD - Event sourcing?"}],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":2133104,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/845b5f96f53f4ece57d1666bad1ad2d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2133104/pat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58222915,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570141232,"creation_date":1570112074,"question_id":58221047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221047","body_markdown":"I&#39;m building a DDD/CQRS Event Sourcing application.

I understand that other OSes such as Linux can be installed, however, we have to go with HP-UX for our applications.\r\n\r\nThank You :-)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221025/can-i-start-an-hp-rx2800-on-a-usb-key-for-os-install-hp-ux","title":"Can I start an HP RX2800 on a USB key for OS install (HP-UX)"},{"tags":[".net-core","entity-framework-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":314,"user_id":7795811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/975bac987b7b54ac8847768f0df98c83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nandhakumar Appusamy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7795811/nandhakumar-appusamy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570136337,"post_id":58221091,"comment_id":102828656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221091/unable-to-add-api-controller-to-net-core-3-api-project#comment102828656_58221091"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10585041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FzmvcHbfOms/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACjs/O5X56O6lQi8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ąńť&#248; Şhęlť&#244;ŋ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10585041/%c4%84%c5%84%c5%a5%c3%b8-%c5%9eh%c4%99l%c5%a5%c3%b4%c5%8b"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10585041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FzmvcHbfOms/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACjs/O5X56O6lQi8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ąńť&#248; Şhęlť&#244;ŋ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10585041/%c4%84%c5%84%c5%a5%c3%b8-%c5%9eh%c4%99l%c5%a5%c3%b4%c5%8b"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570172164,"last_edit_date":1570172164,"creation_date":1570171658,"answer_id":58231227,"question_id":58221091,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58231227","body_markdown":"Go to API dependencies then add the second project, \r\n\r\nAdd the namespace in EF Core models.\r\n\r\n    namespace Sample.Core.Operations.SampleEF\r\n    {\r\n     public class Request \r\n        { \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nCreate the class like:\r\n\r\nCore.Operations.SampleEF.Request request\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221091/unable-to-add-api-controller-to-net-core-3-api-project/58231227#58231227","title":"Unable to add API Controller to .NET Core 3 API Project"}],"migrated_from":{"other_site":{"styling":{"tag_background_color":"#F7FDFF","tag_foreground_color":"#566E76","link_color":"#4E82C2"},"related_sites":[{"relation":"parent","api_site_parameter":"stackoverflow","site_url":"https://stackoverflow.com","name":"Stack Overflow"},{"relation":"chat","site_url":"https://chat.stackoverflow.com","name":"Meta Stack Overflow Chat"}],"markdown_extensions":["Prettify"],"site_state":"linked_meta","high_resolution_icon_url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/content/Sites/stackoverflowmeta/img/apple-touch-icon@2.png","favicon_url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/content/Sites/stackoverflowmeta/img/favicon.ico","icon_url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/content/Sites/stackoverflowmeta/img/apple-touch-icon.png","audience":"professional and enthusiast programmers","site_url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com","api_site_parameter":"meta.stackoverflow","logo_url":"https://meta.stackoverflow.com/content/Sites/stackoverflowmeta/img/logo.png","name":"Meta Stack Overflow","site_type":"meta_site"},"on_date":1570112243,"question_id":390072},"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":2494543,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GwFnQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Greg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2494543/greg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4252,"user_id":424903,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb1996c246077c7854334c21c2e56e5d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gimby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/424903/gimby"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570172164,"creation_date":1570112017,"last_edit_date":1570113021,"question_id":58221091,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221091","body_markdown":"I currently have 2 projects setup - the first ia a .NET Core 3.0 API project and the second one is as well but just contains the EF Core models.  \r\n\r\nI have added a model called Country to the model project and when I try to add a API controller using EF actions for the Country model, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n&gt; Unable to create an object of type &#39;ApplicationDbContext&#39;.

my problems&#39; topic hasn&#39;t been answered in detail in any other thread nor there is no good answer at the official Svg.js web-site I am posting it in a new thread with a detailed specification of the problem.\r\n\r\n**1. My dev stack is:**\r\n\r\na.) CRA (create-react-app) - &quot;react-scripts&quot;: &quot;3.1.2&quot;\r\n\r\nb.) Typescript - &quot;typescript&quot;: &quot;3.6.3&quot;\r\n\r\nc.)

My problem is:**\r\n\r\n If I import my Svg.js library this way: \r\n\r\n    import * as SVG from &quot;@svgdotjs/svg.js&quot;;\r\n\r\nor in this way:\r\n\r\n    import SVG from &quot;@svgdotjs/svg.js/src/svg&quot;;\r\n\r\nThen I can&#39;t use SVG later in any way in my project.\r\n\r\nDoing this for example doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n    let draw = SVG().addTo(&#39;#drawing&#39;).viewbox(0, 0, 300, 140)\r\n    let rect = draw.rect(100, 100).attr({fill: &quot;#f06&quot;})\r\n\r\nI receive messages about **&quot;could not find declaration file for module @svgdotjs/svg.js/src/svg&quot;** when using the second import which I have shown above\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nwhen using the first import presented by me above, suddenly Intellij Idea shows the types in the code but does not recognize the SVG() and says **&quot;This expression is not callable. Type &#39;typeof import(&quot;@svgdotjs/svg.js&quot;)&#39; has no call signatures.&quot;**\r\n\r\nEither way I can&#39;t make it working like it should.\r\n\r\nMy test code is here:\r\n\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import * as SVG from &quot;@svgdotjs/svg.js&quot;;\r\n    //import SVG from &quot;@svgdotjs/svg.js/src/svg&quot;;\r\n    import &#39;./App.css&#39;;\r\n    const App: React.FC = () =&gt; {\r\n      let draw = SVG().addTo(&#39;#drawing&#39;).viewbox(0, 0, 300, 140)\r\n      let rect = draw.rect(100, 100).attr({fill: &quot;#f06&quot;})\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n        SVG.js test :)\r\n          &lt;div id=&quot;drawing&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n    export default App;\r\n\r\n**4.

Instead, it **may** give you an estimation of how your model performs with new and unseen data. Therefore, do not expect much improvement in your test accuracy by implementing cross-validation or changing the number of folds.  \r\nThe answer to your question lies in a basic intuition about machine learning: The more features you have, the more data you need to train a good model. If your model takes many features as input but lacks enough data for training, it won&#39;t be able to generalize and perform very well regardless of how well it is implemented.  \r\n  \r\nNow, some suggestions:\r\n\r\n - If the performance with the optimal number of features (about 30 as you stated) is good enough, stick with it.\r\n - If you need better performance and believe the poor performance is due to the low number of features, try other feature reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis to reduce the number of features while maintaining their useful data as much as possible.\r\n - If none of the above methods work well, try other classification algorithms to find the best one.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221018/svm-cv-error-decreases-with-number-of-features-increased-but-its-overfit-why/58226825#58226825","title":"SVM CV error decreases with number of features increased, but it&#39;s overfit.

Make the factory method a static method in the class itself, since this gives you access to the `private` properties and methods.\r\n2. Mark the constructor as `private` so that no one can use the class without using the factory method.\r\n\r\nIn your case, it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic partial class DataAdapter : BaseEntityDataAdapter, IDataAdapter {\r\n    AppInsightsLogger _log = new AppInsightsLogger();\r\n\r\n    private DataAdapter() : base(&quot;db&quot;) { }\r\n    \r\n    public static async Task&lt;DataAdapter&gt; ConstructAdapterAsync() {\r\n        DataAdapter da = new DataAdapter();\r\n        try {\r\n            var conn = da.Database.Connection as System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection;\r\n            conn.AccessToken = await (new AzureServiceTokenProvider()).GetAccessTokenAsync(&quot;https://database.windows.net/&quot;);\r\n\r\n            return da;\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            da._log.LogError(ex);\r\n            throw;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221010/set-controller-property-asynchronously-in-constructor/58221604#58221604","title":"Set Controller Property Asynchronously In Constructor"}],"owner":{"reputation":195,"user_id":6730679,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78456988d327a2cf4e9ae3d4eafe41e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"deruitda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6730679/deruitda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":406,"user_id":6538278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B2OiM.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"0009laH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6538278/0009lah"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570113988,"creation_date":1570111956,"last_edit_date":1570112847,"question_id":58221010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221010","body_markdown":"I have a ***fully async*** MVC API that injects an interface into all of its controllers:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic PageController(IDataAdapter dataAdapter) {\r\n    _dataAdapter = dataAdapter;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe implementation of the interface needs to have an access token set on its SQLConnection object. This access token is needed for the managed identity secure access (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-tutorial-connect-msi). This token needs to be set when the controller is constructed, so on every new request. The token can change, so we can&#39;t have it be a static value. This is what we have in the interface implementation today:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic partial class DataAdapter : BaseEntityDataAdapter, IDataAdapter {\r\n    AppInsightsLogger _log = new AppInsightsLogger();\r\n    \r\n    #region Constructor\r\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;   \r\n    /// Instantiate the data adapter and pull out the dsn information\r\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\r\n    public DataAdapter() : base(&quot;db&quot;) {\r\n        try {\r\n            var conn = base.Database.Connection as System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection;\r\n            conn.AccessToken = (new AzureServiceTokenProvider()).GetAccessTokenAsync(&quot;https://database.windows.net/&quot;).Result;\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            _log.LogError(ex);\r\n            throw;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that we use *.Result* to evaluate the async operation, which in turn is actually running it synchronously. I know I should be using a factory pattern, like this below instead:\r\n\r\n```chsarp\r\npublic async Task&lt;DataAdapter&gt; ConstructAdapterAsync() {\r\n    try {\r\n        DataAdapter da = new DataAdapter();\r\n        var conn = da.Database.Connection as System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection;\r\n        conn.AccessToken = await (new AzureServiceTokenProvider()).GetAccessTokenAsync(&quot;https://database.windows.net/&quot;);\r\n\r\n        return da;\r\n    } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n        _log.LogError(ex);\r\n        throw;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this still leaves me with the problem that in the controller constructor, I can&#39;t call an async factory function without forcing it to run synchronously. Is there anyway that I can set this property asynchronously?

That causes the VPN connection to default to route everything through the VPN. So simplest is if You can change that. I also want to do this (so add all public-ranges in that list and omit private ranges, maybe besides a special private range to reach the servers LAN). Otherwise You have to manage Your local routing on connecting client &quot;manually&quot;. (If both sides use strongwan it should be possible to narrow it on eighter side without breaking the SA completely, but not certain whether specifying multiple subnets works with IKEv1 between strongswan client and server or whether You would need to define multiple SAs then.)\r\n\r\nRegarding &quot;only way to establish connection&quot;... I&#39;m wondering whether that means You really have the example confiuration (ike2-rw in ipsec.conf) and started daemon and it is not working - but the example is working on server. I had problems with the Strongswan on Ubuntu 18.04 server side (the VPN gateway), it was connecting but connection came not up. The client I did not try. But I found the Ubuntu 18.04 package is broken (or was back then, a few monmth ago) and upgraded my Ubuntu. With 19.04 it works like a charm. (What is Your journal for the strongswan service saying and syslog - or better the /var/log/charon.log when You try to bring up the client as per documentation?)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58221000/problem-with-connecting-ipsec-ikev2-from-ubuntu-18-04/58367782#58367782","title":"Problem with connecting IPSec IKEv2 from Ubuntu 18.04"}],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":7832082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/756810631150362/picture?type=large","display_name":"Igor  Lavrynenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7832082/igor-lavrynenko"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571001431,"creation_date":1570111933,"question_id":58221000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58221000","body_markdown":"There is a computer with Ubuntu 18.04 it is located behind the NAT router and receives the address in the subnet `192.168.1.0/24`.
