What I am trying to do is to edit SVG file from R in Inkscape.\r\nI saved my SVG using `svglite` function.\r\n\r\nIn Inkscape, the SVG looks fine, and I could edit the texts by text tool. The only problem is that the box surrounding the text does not resize by itself. For instance, I have the word &quot;Hello&quot; to edit, after I deleted two characters, the width of that word does not change, so the remaining characters get wider. If I type more letters, then all the letters are squeezed together.\r\n\r\nI do not have any idea why this is happening.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251245/text-box-in-inkscape-does-not-automatically-resize-when-editing","title":"Text box in Inkscape does not automatically resize when editing"},{"tags":["laravel"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7069587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68a22b1f6becd556d4a2d9c22fbfd902?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7069587/stephan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570305386,"post_id":58251455,"comment_id":102873960,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251242/passing-an-array-to-a-function-that-takes-various-arguments/58251455#comment102873960_58251455"},{"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7069587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68a22b1f6becd556d4a2d9c22fbfd902?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7069587/stephan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570306197,"post_id":58251455,"comment_id":102874128,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251242/passing-an-array-to-a-function-that-takes-various-arguments/58251455#comment102874128_58251455"},{"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10468142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TDAyUTTO2m4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW-CDeIyKPI_zv-GKEigrl7SX03LA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rehan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10468142/rehan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7069587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68a22b1f6becd556d4a2d9c22fbfd902?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7069587/stephan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570384966,"post_id":58251455,"comment_id":102888565,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251242/passing-an-array-to-a-function-that-takes-various-arguments/58251455#comment102888565_58251455"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10468142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TDAyUTTO2m4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW-CDeIyKPI_zv-GKEigrl7SX03LA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rehan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10468142/rehan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10468142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-TDAyUTTO2m4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DW-CDeIyKPI_zv-GKEigrl7SX03LA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rehan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10468142/rehan"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570343982,"last_edit_date":1570343982,"creation_date":1570302252,"answer_id":58251455,"question_id":58251242,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58251455","body_markdown":"You are passing the array to `hasAnyRole()` which takes an array as parameter, which means you can passing a list of array values. \r\nAssuming your function is like this\r\n\r\n```php\r\n hasAnyRole($roles){\r\n    ....\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what you are trying to do is `handAnyRole($role1, $role2, ...)` which is not possible.

am writing a debugger for an interpreted language in C#. I only write a &quot;debugger server&quot; handles the language-specific tasks, such as listing local variables. The result is then sent to a &quot;debugger client&quot; (a text editor that displays the listed variables) such as VS Code for example.\r\n\r\nThe debugger uses the [Language Service Protocol][1] by Microsoft, so it needs a specific format. In order to properly display complex data types (objects, arrays) in the debugger window, every object needs to have assigned a `variableReference`, which is a unique integer ID assigned to that object.\r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks on an object in order to &quot;unfold&quot; it in the &quot;Variables&quot; display, a request is send to the debugger server with the variable reference, and a response is sent back to the client with the values inside that object.\r\n\r\n**My progress so far:**\r\n\r\nIn order to identify which object corresponds to which ID, I have created a bi-directional map between objects that the debugger keeps track of, and their IDs (implemented as 2 dictionaries).\r\n\r\nWhen I see an object in the debugger, I try to look it up in this map to get it&#39;s ID, if it is present. If it&#39;s not, I assign it a new ID, and save it into the map for later. When the frontend asks for values in an object (by user clicking on it), I look up the object in the map by it&#39;s ID and resolve the request.\r\n\r\n**The problem:**\r\n\r\nHow to save the objects in the map, so I can look up an existing&#39;s object ID, or easily tell if an object is not yet registered?\r\n\r\nI have tried using a hashmap (dictionary), where hash is computed from the object&#39;s address, and equality is implemented as reference equality. Note that computing the hash from the object content is not possible, since the contents of the object can change during debugging, so the object would not be found in the dictionary after it&#39;s hash has changed.\r\n\r\nI need a hash that would stay the same, even when contents of the object change. Object address seems perfect for that, however I can&#39;t find a solution that works reliably, for example, this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic int GetHashCode(object obj)\r\n{\r\n    GCHandle gch = GCHandle.Alloc(obj, GCHandleType.Pinned);\r\n    IntPtr ptr = gch.AddrOfPinnedObject();\r\n    return ptr.ToInt32();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthrows an `Object contains non-primitive or non-blittable data.` exception.\r\n\r\nHowever that is not the only problem. It is my understanding that the GC can reallocate entire portions of the memory and fix all the addresses used when it does so. This would make the address change, and break the hashcode.\r\n\r\n**Possible solutions:**\r\n\r\n1. *Get rid of the hashmap (dictionary):* When searching for existing ID of an object, manually reference compare it to all the existing objects. This would fix the problem, but would be rather slow.\r\n2. *Manually add the ID directly to the object on creation:* This seems like making most sense, but I am making the debugger as a mod, so this would require too much change of the code for a mod IMO.\r\n3. *Fix the GetAddress method:* Even with the address change, this is a valid solution, because the object can be in the map twice and the debugger will still work properly.\r\n4. *Allocate new ID for each seeing of the object:* This would mean only one-directional map from ID to object, and each object would be multiple times in it with different IDs. It would work, but very heavy on the memory.\r\n5. *Get rid of the map altogether:* This would require not only to fix the GetAddress method, but use the address as the ID directly, and then cast from ID (address) to object directly. This can be dangerous, since the address can contain arbitrary binary data by the time the ID request comes, plus will not work with `long` addresses, since the ID is only an integer.\r\n\r\nOr any other possible solutions? How do debuggers usually solve this problem?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251234/best-way-to-keep-track-of-objects-when-writing-a-debugger","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Best way to keep track of objects when writing a debugger"},{"tags":["python","json","python-requests"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8749,"user_id":2947378,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c054121445db13838d0fbd895f53dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rdas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2947378/rdas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570301034,"post_id":58251233,"comment_id":102872926,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251233/parsing-a-json-string-with-floats-as-strings-in-python#comment102872926_58251233"},{"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":7397195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/779648db8aa35f6274bc93e57c443da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leeprevost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7397195/leeprevost"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8749,"user_id":2947378,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c054121445db13838d0fbd895f53dfc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rdas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2947378/rdas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570307304,"post_id":58251233,"comment_id":102874329,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251233/parsing-a-json-string-with-floats-as-strings-in-python#comment102874329_58251233"},{"owner":{"reputation":14491,"user_id":1329296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1026699dbf4140d3fc7262842428e808?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lenik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1329296/lenik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570414772,"post_id":58251233,"comment_id":102893843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251233/parsing-a-json-string-with-floats-as-strings-in-python#comment102893843_58251233"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":7397195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/779648db8aa35f6274bc93e57c443da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leeprevost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7397195/leeprevost"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14491,"user_id":1329296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1026699dbf4140d3fc7262842428e808?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lenik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1329296/lenik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570378105,"post_id":58257621,"comment_id":102886728,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251233/parsing-a-json-string-with-floats-as-strings-in-python/58257621#comment102886728_58257621"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":7397195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/779648db8aa35f6274bc93e57c443da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leeprevost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7397195/leeprevost"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570367949,"creation_date":1570367949,"answer_id":58257621,"question_id":58251233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58257621","body_markdown":"I ended up needing to write a custom object hook for my json decoder.  \r\n\r\nI also decided to add a camelizer to shorten the keys.\r\n\r\n    import requests\r\n    import re\r\n    import json\r\n    from datetime import datetime\r\n    \r\n    quarterdateformat = &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def camelize(string):\r\n        return &quot;&quot;.join(string.split(&quot; &quot;))\r\n    \r\n    def convert_types(d):\r\n        for k, v in d.items():\r\n            #print(k, type(v))\r\n            new_v = v\r\n            if type(v) is str:\r\n                #match for float\r\n                if re.match(&#39;[-+]?[0-9]*\\.[0-9]+&#39;, v):  \r\n                    new_v = float(v)\r\n\r\n                #match for date\r\n                if re.match(&#39;([12]\\d{3}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\\d|3[01]))&#39;, v):  \r\n                    new_v = datetime.strptime(v, quarterdateformat).date()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n            d[k] = new_v\r\n        d = {camelize(k): v for k, v in d.items()}\r\n        return d\r\n    \r\n    url = &quot;https://financialmodelingprep.com/api/v3/financials/income-statement/CRM,HUBS&quot;\r\n    params = {&#39;datatyupe&#39; : &#39;json&#39;}\r\n    r = requests.get(url, params)\r\n    jd= json.loads(r.text, object_hook=convert_types)\r\n\r\n \r\nconvert_types is the object-hook function which uses regex to look for floats and dates and converts them.

I think I should clarify) The reason I want this procedure to work, I have a master server with multiple remote slaves, the slaves need to have access to the masters database which means they also have to have &quot;root&quot; access, they can create/reconfigure their own access credentials. The problem with this is if one of those servers were ever compromised it would leave open the chance to have a new user added with credentials to basically all of the database.

is a lot going on here and I&#39;m not sure of the programme flow here, but some points of interest perhaps:\r\n\r\nYou call `$(&#39;#payment_form&#39;).bind(...` ~ where is `payment_form`? \r\nSimilarly you call `$(&#39;#alertinfo&#39;)`  where is `alertinfo`??\r\n\r\nWithin the logic for processing the POST array there is a portion of code to generate the hash but you have an `exit`

It really helped drill home how to use currying functions. So, the example you grabbed from final form I&#39;ve personally used with fields. \r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposeValidators(required)(value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrying is an odd concept that you can get by without needing it so don&#39;t fret over not understanding it at first glance. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s look at the signature:\r\n\r\n```const composeValidators = (...validators) =&gt; (value) =&gt;```\r\n\r\nThe first function takes X number of props or validation rules. You&#39;ve got that part down. The second function, now, expects a value. You probably saw it used with Field&#39;s validate props. If you look at the documentation for FieldProps (see link below), you&#39;ll see it takes a function and passes it 3 arguments, value, allValues, and meta, not just value. This can help you write better validation rules that take into account more information about the field. Anyway, when final-form uses this, it takes the form of:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomposeValidators(required)(value, allValues, meta)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t expect this to make sense right away but it should help you think about one specific use case of currying has some advanced options.

I am looking to get a data set such that when I take difference of actual_lat vs cal_lat it should be zero or at least close to zero. I tried to fill these missing values with destination lat and long, but that would result in huge difference. My question is how can I fill these values using python/pandas so that when vehicle followed the OSRM estimated path the difference between actual lat/long and estimated lat/long should be zero or close to zero. I am new to GIS data Sets and have no idea about how to deal with them.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: I am looking for something like this.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n+-----+------------+-------------+-------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n|     | Actual_Lat | Actual_Long |          Time           | Tour ID  | Cal_long | Cal_lat  | coordinates_diff_Lat | coordinates_diff_Lon |\r\n+-----+------------+-------------+-------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n|   0 |  63.433376 |   10.397068 | 2019-09-30 04:48:13.540 |       11 | 10.39729 | 63.43338 |               -0.000 |               -0.000 |\r\n|   1 |  63.433301 |   10.395846 | 2019-09-30 04:48:18.470 |       11 | 10.39731 | 63.43326 |                0.000 |               -0.001 |\r\n|   2 |  63.433259 |   10.394543 | 2019-09-30 04:48:23.450 |       11 | 10.39576 | 63.43323 |                0.000 |               -0.001 |\r\n|   3 |  63.433258 |   10.394244 | 2019-09-30 04:48:29.500 |       11 | 10.39555 | 63.43436 |               -0.001 |               -0.001 |\r\n|   4 |  63.433258 |   10.394215 | 2019-09-30 04:48:35.683 |       11 | 10.39505 | 63.43427 |               -0.001 |               -0.001 |\r\n| ... |        ... |         ... | ...                     |      ... |      ... |      ... |                  ... |                  ... |\r\n|  70 |   63.43000 |    10.35800 | NaT                     | 115268.0 | 10.35826 | 63.43149 |                0.000 |               -0.003 |\r\n|  71 |   63.43025 |    10.35888 | NaT                     | 115268.0 | 10.35809 | 63.43155 |                0.000 |               -0.003 |\r\n|  72 |   63.43052 |    10.35713 | NaT                     | 115268.0 | 10.35772 | 63.43163 |                0.000 |               -0.002 |\r\n|  73 |   63.43159 |    10.35633 | NaT                     | 115268.0 | 10.35646 | 63.43182 |                0.000 |               -0.001 |\r\n|  74 |   63.43197 |    10.35537 | NaT                     | 115268.0 | 10.35536 | 63.43196 |                0.000 |                0.000 |\r\n+-----+------------+-------------+-------------------------+----------+----------+----------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote that ```63.43197,10.35537``` is destination and ```63.433376,10.397068``` is starting position.

I start the day by making a copy of the previous day’s workbook, and make any subsequent code changes on the copy.  When I’m finished I’ll run VBA Code Cleaner, do a Debug, Save then exit Excel.  I also save a backup copy.  I’ll then reopen &amp; close both of these workbooks a number of times just to satisfy myself that everything is still working.\r\n\r\nThe next day I’ll wake the computer and try to open these files, and as soon as the VBA code starts to run I’ll get the “Microsoft Excel has stopped working” message.  This can happen to either the main file or the backup file, and sometimes both.\r\n\r\nIf I open the bad file with the shift key down, I can get into the VBE area OK, but when I do a Debug or try to run VBA Code Cleaner I get the same message.\r\n\r\nThe only way I’ve found to recover from this is to:\r\n\r\n1.\tManually export the code\r\n2.\tSave the file as an xlsx file, thus expunging all the code.\r\n3.\tSave the xlsx file as a new xlsm/xlsb file, and then import the exported code.\r\n\r\nI just today found another way to recover is to save the file as “xls”, then re-save as xlsb/xlsm, that somehow seems to “clean” something.\r\n\r\nAfter the recovery everything is fine again, at least for a few days.\r\nWhat I’ve tried so far:\r\n\r\n1.\tSearched the internet, including StackOverflow, for possible solution.\r\n2.\tRun various virus checkers (MS Essentials, Malwarebytes, SuperAntiSpyware)\r\n3.\tRepaired MS Office 2010.\r\n4.\tUninstalled and re-installed MS Office 2010\r\n5.\tRemoved all add-ins\r\n6.\tUninstalled  Dropbox\r\n7.\tStarted using a new user profile.\r\n\r\nI came across several articles that suggested xlsb files were prone to corruption, so I started saving as xlsm files.  Everything went well for about a week, and I thought I’d resolved the problem.  However, it’s now started happening with the xlsm files too, so I’m back to square one.\r\n\r\nI’m running out of ideas - the next thing I might try would be re-installing Windows 7, but I really hope to avoid doing that!  I would really appreciate any suggestions.

You want to upload an image to Google Drive using googleapis with node.js.\r\n- The image of `img` is the base64 data.\r\n- You have already been able to upload and download files to Google Drive using Drive API.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, how about this answer? Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\n### Modification points:\r\n- Unfortunately, when the base64 data is uploaded using googleapis, the base64 data is not decoded and the data is upload as the text data. So when you see the uploaded file, you cannot see it as the image. If `Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64` can be added to the header of the base64 data in the request body, the base64 data is converted and uploaded as an image. But when googleapis is used, in the current stage, it cannot be achieved.\r\n\r\nIn order to upload the base64 data encoded from an image as an image to Google Drive, how about the following modification?\r\n\r\n### Modified script:\r\nIn this modification, the base64 image is converted to the stream type, and uploaded. Please modify your script as follows.\r\n\r\n#### From:\r\n\tconst uploadImg = img.split(/,(.+)/)[1];\r\n\r\n\tconst media = {\r\n\t  body: uploadImg\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n#### To:\r\n\tconst stream = require(&quot;stream&quot;); // Added\r\n\r\n\tconst uploadImg = img.split(/,(.+)/)[1];\r\n\tconst buf = new Buffer.from(uploadImg, &quot;base64&quot;); // Added\r\n\tconst bs = new stream.PassThrough(); // Added\r\n\tbs.end(buf); // Added\r\n\r\n\tconst media = {\r\n\t  body: bs // Modified\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n- Even if `&#39;mimeType&#39;:&#39;image/jpeg&#39;` is used at `fileMetadata`, the image file is uploaded as `image/png`. But for example, if `&#39;mimeType&#39;:&#39;application/pdf&#39;` is used at `fileMetadata`, the image file is uploaded as `application/pdf`. Please be careful this. So I also recommend to modify to `&#39;mimeType&#39;:&#39;image/png&#39;` as mentioned by [10100111001&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58252163/7108653).\r\n- At &quot;googleapis@43.0.0&quot;, both patterns of `resource: fileMetadata` and `requestBody: fileMetadata` work.\r\n\r\n### References:\r\n- [Class Method: Buffer.from(string[, encoding])](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_class_method_buffer_from_string_encoding)\r\n- [Class: stream.PassThrough](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_class_stream_passthrough)\r\n- [Files: create in Drive API](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/files/create)\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood your question and this was not the direction you want, I apologize.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251141/base64-string-img-not-viewable-when-uploaded-via-drive-api/58253659#58253659","title":"Base64 string img not viewable when uploaded via drive api"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12169704,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9383626397968501926bc8d43f7123c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonathan Davis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169704/jonathan-davis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2201,"user_id":3617531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xWKNp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alejandro Teixeira Mu&#241;oz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3617531/alejandro-teixeira-mu%c3%b1oz"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570326619,"creation_date":1570299959,"last_edit_date":1570308446,"question_id":58251141,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251141","body_markdown":"I have uploaded a base64 img string to Google Drive via API in node express.

operator:\r\n\r\n    var bob = false; // &lt;-- this is opposite of above\r\n    while( ! bob ) { // &lt;-- so we&#39;ll use the ! to flip it\r\n        // this will run one time.\r\n        bob = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo the tricky part is that the &quot;negation&quot; operator leverages the funky &quot;truthiness&quot; understanding in the language... we can leverage this and &quot;flip&quot; truthiness entities like string, array, object to check if they &quot;are&quot; or &quot;are not&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo based on our understanding of &quot;truthyness&quot; we can say:\r\n\r\n    var bob = &quot;silly&quot;;\r\n    bob == true;    // true\r\n    !bob == false;  // true\r\n\r\n    var sally = 0;\r\n    sally == false; // true\r\n    !sally == true; // true\r\n\r\nNOTE: Strict type evaluation is handled through triple equals === and !==\r\n\r\nNow to the point (let&#39;s make things simpler):\r\n\r\n    let yourName;\r\n\r\n    while ( ! yourName ) {\r\n      // &quot;prompt&quot; will \r\n      // 1.

Return null (falsy) or a text string (truthy)\r\n      yourName = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo in the above, we are preventing the script from execution until the prompt returns a valid name.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251101/what-is-the-purpose-of-adding-a-negation-operator-in-the-while-condition/58253878#58253878","title":"What is the purpose of adding a negation operator in the while condition?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9152474,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-GVd4e01AbUw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAw0/ROn9VY6OyLo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aun Suhel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9152474/aun-suhel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21220,"user_id":3082296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EmdM0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"adiga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3082296/adiga"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570330622,"creation_date":1570299649,"last_edit_date":1570302481,"question_id":58251101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251101","body_markdown":"can i use the check to find out if yourName variable is false, instead of using the negation operator to change its type.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let yourName;\r\n\r\n    do {\r\n      yourName = prompt(&quot;Who are you?&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    while (!yourName);\r\n\r\n    console.log(yourName);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nthe results are the same","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251101/what-is-the-purpose-of-adding-a-negation-operator-in-the-while-condition","title":"What is the purpose of adding a negation operator in the while condition?"},{"tags":["css","gluon-mobile"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12121871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d323a55f682e23d31323f7af18d4feba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Meilleur102","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12121871/meilleur102"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570462401,"post_id":58255871,"comment_id":102912221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251100/gluonmobile-css-navigation-drawer-selected/58255871#comment102912221_58255871"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":32096,"user_id":3956070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqUhH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jos&#233;

This is not a specialization. It&#39;s important to get this out of the way to get at a solution. This is overloading. The two function templates overload the `make` name. And overload resolution determines which is a better match after synthesizing their signatures. In your case, the two signatures the compiler can deduce are \r\n\r\n    int make(MyVector);\r\n    int make(std::vector&lt;int&gt; const&amp;);\r\n    \r\nOne is the identity conversion, while the other requires binding a reference to a base, which ranks worse than &quot;identity&quot; as far as conversions go. So the first overload gets chosen.\r\n\r\nYou have a few options before you:\r\n\r\n 1. Prefer a type alias like `using MyVector = std::vector&lt;int&gt;;`. It&#39;s streight forward, matches the second overload exactly, and will make it get chosen due to partial ordering of function templates.\r\n\r\n 2. Add a `MyVector` overload, that delegates:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    int make(MyVector const&amp; v) { return make(static_cast&lt;MyVector::vector const&amp;&gt;(v)); }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n 3. Use a more sophisticated technique to control overload resolution. The standard library has a few utilites for [SFINAE][1] based control of the process. It would require changing the first overload to this:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    std::enable_if_t&lt;!std::is_convertible_v&lt;T*, std::vector&lt;int&gt;*&gt;, int&gt;\r\n    make(T value) {\r\n        return 1;\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    But this approach is overly expert friendly and will quickly not scale with many template overloads. I recommend the previous two approaches first.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251090/c-function-templates-specialization-for-templated-base-class/58251322#58251322","title":"C++ Function templates specialization for templated base class"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":9967707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e752dfc42372e8c8a4da13c70dc2565?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"luxderfux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9967707/luxderfux"},"last_editor":{"reputation":85,"user_id":10696143,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rAhKx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"winidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10696143/winidis"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570302064,"creation_date":1570299516,"last_edit_date":1570302064,"question_id":58251090,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251090","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement a member function template specialization for a templated class and all derived children.

So in this case, `multiplyBy` takes `x` and returns a function that expects `y` then when that function is invoked with the parameter, it calls `multiply` with both `x` and `y`.\r\n\r\nAn even simpler and generic way to partially apply a function is to use [`Function.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind#Partially_applied_functions) which allows you to set some of the parameters. You can set the first one and you will get a function that expects the second parameter:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function multiply(x, y){\r\n        if (y === 0) return 0;\r\n        return x + multiply(x, y - 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var multiplyBy123 = multiply.bind(null, 123);\r\n\r\n    console.log(multiplyBy123(3));\r\n    console.log(multiplyBy123(10));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you are allowed to change `multiply`, then you can make it even simpler and just use a [default parameter value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Default_parameters) to set `y` to `123` if not specified:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function multiply(x, y = 123){\r\n        if (y === 0) return 0;\r\n        return x + multiply(x, y - 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    console.log(multiply(3));\r\n    console.log(multiply(10));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251084/recursive-multiply-function/58251222#58251222","title":"Recursive multiply function"}],"owner":{"reputation":248,"user_id":9242883,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5304442e38e3ce9d20fce061c5ff9f2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jj008","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9242883/jj008"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570300565,"creation_date":1570299487,"question_id":58251084,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251084","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to do an assignment where it asks to produce a function that multiplies a positive integer by 123 without using loops or `*` or the divide operator.\r\n\r\n    function multiply(x, y){\r\n        if (y === 0) return 0;\r\n        return x + multiply(x, y - 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have a function that can multiply 2 numbers but how can I structure this to multiply by a fixed number?

The account name in list view is properly updated (showing the single character entered)\r\n* When I&#39;m entering the textfied again, I can type more characters without losing focus (again, the account name in the list view is update)\r\n* As soon as I press enter, the TextField&#39;s value restores to the old value, while the list view&#39;s value remains at the updated value.\r\n* When switching back and forth between different account entries, the detail view shows the correct values. So the model object was properly updated.\r\n\r\n## My questions:\r\n\r\n1. Why does the TextField lose focus when entering a single character for the first time\r\n2.

I do not know if this is a bug in visjs or there is some other reason for it. The docs say they return the position of the node in the canvas space. But thats clearly not the case in your example.\r\n\r\nLooking at the docs [ https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/#Events ] the click event argument contains: \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        nodes: [Array of selected nodeIds],\r\n        edges: [Array of selected edgeIds],\r\n        event: [Object] original click event,\r\n        pointer: {\r\n            DOM: {x:pointer_x, y:pointer_y},     // &lt;&lt; Try using this values\r\n            canvas: {x:canvas_x, y:canvas_y}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTry to use the params.pointer.DOM or params.pointer.canvas positions X and Y to position your popup. This should be the location of the cursor. This will be the same position as the node, since you clicked on it.\r\n\r\nSo try something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    document.getElementById(&#39;popup&#39;).style.top = params.pointer.DOM.y

The layout logic seems simple.\r\n\r\nI have a div on the left with a class of &#39;left-frame&#39; that acts as a container for the left content. This div is styled as follows:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n    .left-frame\r\n    {\r\n        display: inline-block;\r\n        height: 100vh;\r\n        width: 45vw;\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        vertical-align: top;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n````\r\n*(I also don&#39;t understand why I had to specify the vertical align. Without it the main image div and the left frame div were misaligned, but that&#39;s a separate question)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right side of the layout is just a div with a class of main-image that has an img element inside and is meant to take up the rest of the screen. Styled as follows:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n    .main-image\r\n    {\r\n       width: 54vw;\r\n       height: 100vh;\r\n       display: inline-block;\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    .main-image img\r\n    {\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        height: 100%;\r\n        object-fit: cover;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nFinally, the bottom blue part is supposed to end up styled as a banner with contact information sitting on top of all other elements. Currently it is styled as follows:\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n    .contacts__body\r\n    {\r\n        background: var(--main-blue);\r\n        width: 100vw;\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        z-index: 10;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe absolute positioning with z-index is not functioning properly. I know it&#39;s something I&#39;m doing wrong but I can&#39;t understand why. \r\n\r\nBelow is the final design I&#39;m trying to re-create for reference.\r\n\r\nAlso the full code is here in a
