Was it fifa world cup or the olympics?&quot;) Then maybe have some random factor that makes it randomize it between different year and when the person types wrong tournament then it says\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;Wrong tournament. Try again&quot;)\r\n\r\nOr maybe could the program just understand the relation between year and tournament like and spouts out correct answers like:\r\n\r\nprint/input(&quot;write a year between 1950-2050:&quot; and the person writes 1982\r\nthen the program says\r\nfifa cup\r\nand if wrong\r\n&quot;wrong cup&quot;\r\n\r\nmaybe I can do a mix between all these two?\r\nSome fact based program and quiz oriented\r\n\r\nWhat do you guys think? \r\n\r\n\r\nI have no clue how to code this would appreciate all the tips I can get but I am thinking in the lines like this\r\n``` python\r\nimport random\r\n\r\nQuestions = int(input(&quot;How many questions do you want?&quot;))\r\n\r\nIOC = (1952,1956,1960,1964,1968,1972,1976,1980,1984,1988,1992,1996,2000,2004,2008,2012,2016,2020,2024,2028,2032,2036,2040,2044,2048)\r\n\r\nFifacup =(1950,1954,1958,1962,1966,1970,1974,1978,1982,1986,1990,1994,1998,2002,2006,2010,2014,2018,2022,2026,2030,2034,2038,2042,2046,2050)\r\n\r\nIOC = random.randint(1,2050)\r\n\r\nFifacup = random.randint(1,2050)\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\nAnswer = int(input(&quot;What is &quot;+str(IOC)+&quot;+&quot;+str(Fifacup)+&quot;? &quot;))\r\nif answer == (IOC+Fifacup):\r\nprint (&quot;Very good!

That temporary actor is used as\r\n&gt; the sender of the `MessageB2C` message send to actor C. That means that\r\n&gt; when C replies, it is not to B, but rather to the temporary actor\r\n&gt; created by `ask`. In each retry, that will be a new actor, and when the\r\n&gt; `ask` times out, the temporary actor will be stopped.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Then, when you use `expectNoMessage`, the test will have to wait for the\r\n&gt; entire duration that you pass to it (100ms) before proceeding. That\r\n&gt; means that by the time you call `actorC.reply(MessageB2C_Ack())`, the\r\n&gt; temporary sender of the previous message will have timed out and\r\n&gt; stopped, and there should be a new retried message in actor C’s\r\n&gt; mailbox. That’s why the reply goes to dead letters. I believe you will\r\n&gt; be able to solve this by adding another\r\n&gt; `actorC.expectMsg(200.milliseconds, MessageB2C())` in between\r\n&gt; `actorA.expectNoMessage(100.milliseconds)` and\r\n&gt; `actorC.reply(MessageB2C_Ack())`.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; In general, using an `ask` from inside an actor like this is often\r\n&gt; discouraged in favor of directly modelling the request and response\r\n&gt; flow directly in the sending actor.

T.objects.annotate(category_id=F(&#39;symbol__category_id&#39;)).prefetch_related(&#39;tags&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    for t in query:\r\n    \t_dict = model_to_dict(t)\r\n

_tags\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this code, `_dict` gives me the wanted result.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, T has many other fields I don&#39;t need, so I changed `query` to:\r\n\r\n    T.objects.only(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot;, &quot;tags&quot;).annotate(category=F(&#39;symbol__category_id&#39;)).prefetch_related(&#39;tags&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason, this slows down the execution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal query takes 6 seconds while the last one takes 8 seconds. Why?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can I prefetch everything correctly so that I don&#39;t have to loop over tags and append their ids in a dictionary? How can I do this while also using `.only()`?\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n\r\nfor some reason, using `.defer()` instead of only, and indicating the fields I don&#39;t want, works without any performance hit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the difference between `defer` and `only`, and why one creates a performance bottleneck?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945294/adding-only-before-prefetch-related-slows-down-query","title":"Adding &#39;only&#39; before prefetch related slows down query"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":3368082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e2b6f3d1b6f0f6751818926a2035e49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Usman Waheed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3368082/usman-waheed"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568560264,"post_id":57945288,"comment_id":102304399,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945288/text-next-to-a-div-that-serves-as-a-line#comment102304399_57945288"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":217,"user_id":11954696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAA5OY2Q8IqjI2lTlHJj92QqSSG5yd-In8hp8bD=k-s128","display_name":"Ahmed Salameh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11954696/ahmed-salameh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568560281,"creation_date":1568560281,"answer_id":57945411,"question_id":57945288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57945411","body_markdown":"you can achieve that by using `:after` selector:\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .circle {\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n      vertical-align: center;\r\n      width: 20px;\r\n      height: 20px;\r\n      background-color: #D3072A;\r\n      border: solid 1px #D3072A;\r\n      border-radius: 50%;\r\n      position: absolute;\r\n      top: -9px;\r\n      left: -1px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .markers {\r\n      top: 10%;\r\n      left: 5%;\r\n      width: 200px;\r\n      height: 3px;\r\n      background-color: #D3072A;\r\n      position: absolute;\r\n    }\r\n    .markers::after {\r\n      width:100%;\r\n      content:&quot;Text&quot;; /*Text here*/\r\n      position:absolute;\r\n      right:-100%;\r\n      top:-9px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;markers&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;div class=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nI hope this works.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945288/text-next-to-a-div-that-serves-as-a-line/57945411#57945411","title":"Text next to a div that serves as a line"}],"owner":{"reputation":537,"user_id":11397070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZvsX6QPbv40/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfTpb79ZM_-uLtDAEQM-Fq8R-Xokw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11397070/tim"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57945411,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568560281,"creation_date":1568559447,"question_id":57945288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57945288","body_markdown":"I have the following HTML and CSS for a line with a circle at the beginning.\r\n\r\nThis circle serves as an information for an image - it points at it - hence I need some text at the end of the line.

One is a drop-down menu and the other is a &quot;clear plot&quot; button. \r\n\r\nAs things are now, the &quot;clear plot&quot; button makes a callback to a function that clears all points from the plot. The drop down menu is for selecting values that will change plotting limits.

So your lexer will never terminate.\r\n\r\nIf you want to signal that there is no more data, you need to return 1 from `yywrap()`.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s probably better to avoid the need for `yywrap` by placing \r\n\r\n    %option noyywrap\r\n\r\nin the flex prologue.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI usually use `%option noinput nounput noyywrap`, which eliminates some compiler warnings assuming you ask for compiler warnings, which you should always do. Also `%option nodefault` can help you find lex specification bugs, since it will complain if some input does not have a matching rule. (The default (f)lex action on unrecognised input is to simply write the unmatched character to standard output. That&#39;s not usually very helpful, and unlike an error message, it is very easy to miss.) Finally, `%option 8bit` is only necessary if you request a lexer optimised for speed rather than table-size. But it doesn&#39;t hurt to add it, and it might save you from an embarrassing bug if you (or someone) someday decides to try the faster scanner skeleton.

I can successfully get the label binded, but the image does not show. The reason for this seems to be because i change the bindingcontext in the grid where the image is nested inside. I change the bindingcontext in order to get an accurate width for the image.\r\n\r\nIf i move the image outside the grid, then it shows, so now i am trying to get the bindingcontext in order again. \r\n\r\nWhat i tried to do with the image was to add a new bindingcontext\r\n         \r\n`BindingContext=&quot;{x:Reference Name=gridFollowers}&quot;

E.g. it can be implemented in Simulation window.\r\n\r\nI was looking for suitable JAVA code but I did not find anything except Visible-property.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945156/how-to-exclude-ignore-a-gis-route-programmatically-in-anylogic","title":"How to exclude (ignore) a GIS route programmatically in Anylogic?"},{"tags":["css","flexbox","text-alignment"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":107381,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568558706,"post_id":57945153,"comment_id":102303989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945153/change-text-alignement-upon-flex-break#comment102303989_57945153"},{"owner":{"reputation":2089,"user_id":1469714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4730e147a47da636e56a4692e6e71bff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xryl669","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1469714/xryl669"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":107381,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568558838,"post_id":57945153,"comment_id":102304025,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945153/change-text-alignement-upon-flex-break#comment102304025_57945153"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2089,"user_id":1469714,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4730e147a47da636e56a4692e6e71bff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"xryl669","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1469714/xryl669"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568642121,"post_id":57945368,"comment_id":102328592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945153/change-text-alignement-upon-flex-break/57945368#comment102328592_57945368"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":107381,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568560052,"creation_date":1568560052,"answer_id":57945368,"question_id":57945153,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57945368","body_markdown":"Here is a *hack* to be used with caution *(or not used at all ...)*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .cont {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n      overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .cont:before {\r\n      content: &quot;&quot;;\r\n      flex: 1 0 20vw;\r\n      height: 1.2em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    span {\r\n      flex: 1 1 20rem;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    span:before,\r\n    span:after {\r\n      content: attr(data-text);\r\n      position: absolute;\r\n      padding-right: 0.5em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    span:before {\r\n      left: 0;\r\n      bottom: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    span:after {\r\n      top: 0;\r\n      right: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    input {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&#39;cont&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;span data-text=&quot;Label&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;

value=&quot;Text here&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not want to have media queries because there&#39;s always the pain to find the breaking point (and this can evolve based on the design changes or device evolutions). Here, I&#39;ve *still* used media queries but the `40rem` magic value is computed, not selected by hand. \r\nTypically, one of the form&#39;s row item has a fixed size, the other being relative to the viewport size. In this example, the fixed size is `20rem`.\r\n\r\nSince they are flex items, they&#39;ll wrap when they can&#39;t fit anymore on this row, that is when their width will reach their `flex-basis` property. \r\n\r\nThus, the width of the row is `span_width[20rem] + input_width[50% * w] = 100% * w`\r\nI&#39;m deducing that they will wrap when `100% w = 50% w + 20rem =&gt; 50%w = 20rem =&gt; w = 40rem` \r\n\r\nSo they&#39;ll wrap when the viewport&#39;s width becomes lower than `40rem`.\r\n\r\nThe main issue with this is that you must know the exact margin &amp; padding size around such items and this is a real pain to maintain. \r\n\r\n\r\n#Another solution which is not using media queries:\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n   html, body { padding: 0; margin: 0 }\r\n    #test\r\n    {\r\n        display: flex;\r\n        align-items: center;\r\n        flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n        flex-direction: row;\r\n    }\r\n    #test p\r\n    {\r\n        flex: 0 1 20rem;\r\n        padding:0;\r\n        margin:0;\r\n    }\r\n    #test p s\r\n    {\r\n        width: calc((48vw - 100%) * 5000);\r\n        min-width: 1%;\r\n        max-width: 16rem;\r\n        \r\n        display: inline-block;\r\n        background: salmon;\r\n        height: 1rem;\r\n    }\r\n    #test p span\r\n    {\r\n        background: red;\r\n        padding-right: 0.5rem;\r\n    }\r\n    #test b\r\n    {\r\n        flex: 1 0 50vw;\r\n        background: yellow;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;test&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt;\r\n            &lt;s&gt;&lt;/s&gt;\r\n            &lt;span&gt;First&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;b&gt;Second&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThis works this way:\r\n\r\n1. The label is split in 2 inline elements, a spacer and the label itself.\r\n2. The spacer is using the Fab Four trick, that is, the `width` property is calculated to oscillate between `+infinite` and `-infinite` in order to be constrained by either `min-width` and `max-width`. \r\n3. The breakpoint is set by the 2nd item in the flex&#39;s row (in the example, `window_width:100vw - input_width:50vw`): when the size left for the label is smaller than the minimum width of the row, its `max-width` property is used and this adds a &quot;space&quot; push the label element to the right. When the flex row wraps, the size left is now very large and above the breakpoint, and thus the `min-width` is selected (in my example, I&#39;ve used `1%` but it can be `0%`, that is, almost no &quot;margin&quot; on the left of the label).\r\n\r\nThe caveat of this technic is that you must add a element (could probably be done with a `::before` pseudo element here) and you must set a `max-width` less than the `parent width - label width`. \r\nThat point makes this solution is a pain to maintain.

I have two semi-working versions. \r\n\r\nVersion One: It works fine on the first search, but subsequent searches will filter the prior results. (For instance, if I first filter by location, then by date, rather than getting a completely new set of results, I get a list that uses both filters. If I enter a new location in my second search, I get no results, as each row has only one location.) \r\n\r\nVersion Two: Does new search, but applies only one filter at a time (whichever was last). \r\n\r\nMy original code is posted below. \r\n\r\nI tried using `tbody.html(&quot;&quot;);` to reset the table; that didn&#39;t work. \r\n\r\nI tried switching the name of my filtered results to tableData2. (That did give me a fresh start for each click of the button but took away my ability to search for multiple criteria.) \r\n\r\nI also tried earlier to put all of the filters into the final line defining tableData (here):\r\n```\r\ntableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.shape==inputShape)\r\n```\r\nbut that didn&#39;t work. \r\n\r\n``` var button = d3.select(&quot;#filter-btn&quot;);\r\nbutton.on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n\td3.event.preventDefault() \r\n\t//Add date filter\r\n\tlet dateElement = d3.select(&quot;#datetime&quot;);\r\n\tlet inputDate = dateElement.property(&quot;value&quot;);\r\n\tif (inputDate){\r\n\ttableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.datetime==inputDate)}; //add if filter to avoid nulls\r\n\t// Add city filter\r\n\tlet cityElement = d3.select(&quot;#city&quot;);\r\n\tlet inputCity = cityElement.property(&quot;value&quot;);\r\n\tif(inputCity){\r\n\ttableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.city==inputCity)};\r\n\t// Add state filter\r\n\tlet stateElement = d3.select(&quot;#state&quot;);\r\n\tlet inputState = stateElement.property(&quot;value&quot;);\r\n\tif (inputState) {\r\n\ttableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.state==inputState)};\r\n\t// Add country filter\r\n\tlet countryElement = d3.select(&quot;#country&quot;);\r\n\tlet inputCountry = countryElement.property(&quot;value&quot;);\r\n\tif (inputCountry){\r\n\ttableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.country == inputCountry)};\r\n\t// Add shape filter\r\n\tlet shapeElement = d3.select(&quot;#shape&quot;);\r\n\tlet inputShape = shapeElement.property(&quot;value&quot;);\r\n\tif (inputShape){\r\n\ttableData = tableData.filter(row =&gt; row.shape==inputShape)};\r\n\tbuildTable(tableData);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe expected result is that if I run a search on a single element, I would get all results that have a near-match for that element. If I ran a search on two elements, I would get all results that had near-matches for both elements.\r\n\r\nThe desired result is that I get either a table that can be filtered by only one element at a time (but which will reset each time I click the filter button), or I get a table that will apply multiple filters, but only one at a time (and without being asked to).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945103/resetting-filters-before-adding-new-ones","title":"Resetting filters before adding new

However, you can avoid these events using monitoring services such as Pingdom or New Relic that can prevent a web dyno from sleeping\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#automatic-dyno-restarts\r\n  [2]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dynos#graceful-shutdown-with-sigterm\r\n  [3]: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/free-dyno-hours#dyno-sleeping","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945092/heroku-can-app-get-recycled-while-it-is-being-used/57948260#57948260","title":"Heroku - Can app get recycled while it is being used?"}],"owner":{"reputation":544,"user_id":7992397,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c56285d2fec1b66648161d9288ca251a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"debashish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7992397/debashish"},"last_editor":{"reputation":544,"user_id":7992397,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c56285d2fec1b66648161d9288ca251a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"debashish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7992397/debashish"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568582434,"creation_date":1568557875,"last_edit_date":1568560726,"question_id":57945092,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57945092","body_markdown":"I plan to deploy a mini web app to resize photos to the heroku free tier.

The tenant is discovered from the URL, e.g. \r\n\r\n    https://apple.myapi.com, \r\n    https://samsung.myapi.com, \r\n    https://google.myapi.com\r\n\r\nSo each of such URLs will eventually point on same IP, but based on the fist word in the URL the app discovers tenant on use appropriate db connection.\r\n\r\nEach such tenant has it&#39;s own Authority URL. We use Keycloak as identity management server, so each tenant on it has it&#39;s own REALM.\r\nSo the Authority URL per tenant is something like that:\r\n\r\n    https://mykeycloack.com/auth/realms/11111111, \r\n    https://mykeycloack.com/auth/realms/22222222,\r\n    https://mykeycloack.com/auth/realms/33333333\r\n\r\nThe API application should be able to add and remove tenants dynamically, without restarting application so, setting all the tenants in the application startup is not a good idea.\r\n\r\nI was trying to add more schemas with more calls to AddJwtBearer, however all the calls go to the schema &quot;Bearer&quot;, according to options.Events.OnAuthenticationFailed event. It&#39;s not clear how to make other schemas to handle calls with Bearer token in HTTP header. Even though if it&#39;s somehow possible with a help of custom middle-ware, as I mention before providing tenant specific configuration for Bearer token authentication in the app startup is not a solution as new tenants need to be added dynamically.\r\n\r\nAdditional info:\r\nAccording to the fiddler the Authority URL is is finally combined with\r\n\r\n    /.well-known/openid-configuration\r\n\r\nand called when first request comes to the API end point marked with \r\n\r\n    [Authorize]\r\n\r\nIf the to configuration fails, then API call fails to. If the call to configuration is successful, the application is not calling it again on next API requests.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to any suggestions.

In the previous example, the only pattern of the rule fits in the lines: 1, 2, 3, ... and we can know it with linear cost.\r\n\r\nIf placeholders can be replaced by a fixed character (eg. &quot;*&quot;) you could search every input line with amorticed constant cost (hashing) the matching patterns.\r\n\r\nThus, you only have to keep the patterns in memory (in a hash table), you can go through the input file linearly (which can be much larger than the available memory) and return only the set of patterns that have fitted together.\r\n\r\nBut since *&quot;it means the place holder values have to be same&quot;*, you can&#39;t use any efficient search algorithm and, instead constant cost (hashing), you must to pay linear cost (for every input line). Anyway better than quadratic over the number of input lines.\r\n\r\nOf course you won&#39;t have given the solutions completely, with those indexes you can go through them quadratically in order.\r\n\r\nThe implementation of this efficient strategy I leave it to you as an exercise ;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945047/classify-the-input-set-into-categories-based-on-pre-defined-rule-set/57946071#57946071","title":"Classify the input set into categories based on pre-defined rule set"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12069875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l1lkvbAiPtc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reWT-Kfroy3R32GFYvppSfCgZ6GMA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shreya Shetty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12069875/shreya-shetty"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12069875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-l1lkvbAiPtc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reWT-Kfroy3R32GFYvppSfCgZ6GMA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shreya Shetty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12069875/shreya-shetty"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568570048,"creation_date":1568557619,"last_edit_date":1568570048,"question_id":57945047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57945047","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to solve a problem where there are 2 input files given,\r\n\r\n**Input 1:**\r\n\r\nA set of strings in the format.

(All alphabets are keywords and integers are placeholders)\r\n\r\n**Input 2:**\r\n\r\nA set of rules and names to each set of rules. Each rule set can have 1 or more rules. All the rule sets start with &quot;A&quot;\r\n\r\n**Rule 1: (Name: Red)**\r\n\r\n* A-X-^\r\n\r\n**Rule 2: (Name: Blue)**\r\n\r\n* A-X-P-Q-R\r\n* A-X-P-Q-S\r\n\r\n**Rule 3: (Name: Yellow)**\r\n\r\n* A-X-P-Q-S\r\n* A-X-P-Q-R\r\n\r\n**Rule 4: (Name: Green)**\r\n\r\n* A-M-$-P\r\n* A-M-@-Q\r\n* A-M-#-P\r\n\r\n**Rule 5: (Name: Purple)**\r\n\r\n* A-V-B-H-$\r\n* A-J-K-L-$-S-Y\r\n* A-U-$-W-E\r\n\r\nWhere alphabets are keywords, others (such as ^,$,@,#...) are placeholders.

I&#39;ll provide some resources below so you know what to start research on, then when you have questions when implementing them, it&#39;s best if you post detailed questions about each step.\r\n\r\nYou can also use this as a way to guide you into constructing your project.\r\n\r\n5) **IMPORTANT** This is actually the most important step: if you are going to be &#39;scraping&#39; or grabbing a large amount of images from the website, **make sure the site you are grabbing from allows you to do it!**. Check out this article [here](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/best-practices-and-guidelines-for-scraping) about scraping ettiquete, so you don&#39;t get into any trouble.\r\n\r\n1) For number 1, the process will consist of two steps. One step is accepting the string input from the user. You can take a look at this tutorial [here](https://pynative.com/python-input-function-get-user-input/), or search through how to accept and handle inputs from the user. Secondly, you will need to feed that user input into what is called a &#39;webdriver&#39;. The webdriver allows you to automate a web browser to browse the web for you and query for images (eg. through google images). You can find some resources about the Chrome webdriver [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started) or online.\r\n\r\n2)  This step is done much easier than step one, just consult on how to extract from urls from the question you posted yourself. [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6415015/python-how-to-grab-images-off-the-internet#). You could make a list of links from the results and just grab an image from a random link. To add to that, for python 3, the function you need instead is urllib.request.urlopen(url). The best practice would make use of the code as referenced [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7243750/download-file-from-web-in-python-3)\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport urllib.request\r\nimport shutil\r\n...\r\n# Download the file from `url` and save it locally under `file_name`:\r\nwith urllib.request.urlopen(url) as response, open(file_name, &#39;wb&#39;) as out_file:\r\n    shutil.copyfileobj(response, out_file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n3) This step involves using some libraries to display images from Python, you can find a question detailing it [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13327759/how-do-i-display-and-close-an-image-with-python). This step depends on which OS you are using, but you can find helpful posts on Stack Overflow for them.\r\n\r\n4) If you want to do this without opening a browser, search up on how to use the WebDriver without GUI display, either on the web or SO.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945045/how-do-i-take-a-random-photo-out-of-the-results-that-come-for-a-key-word-off-t/57945207#57945207","title":"How do I take a random photo (out of the results that come for a key word) off the internet and then make python show it to me?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11298791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FYOOkW1RAaQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczdPw2kqAH7I4XJ5PFFDboUNw0dA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11298791/manav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11298791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FYOOkW1RAaQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczdPw2kqAH7I4XJ5PFFDboUNw0dA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11298791/manav"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568624672,"accepted_answer_id":57945207,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568572712,"creation_date":1568557612,"last_edit_date":1568558198,"question_id":57945045,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57945045","body_markdown":"My question is similar to [this][1] one but I have a few concerns:\r\n\r\n1) How do we query for a photo after typing a few key words\r\n\r\n2) How do we take a random photo out of the results\r\n\r\n3) How do I display the photo that came out\r\n\r\n4) How I can do all of this without opening the browser\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any help you could give me. \r\n(this is all in python 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6415015/python-how-to-grab-images-off-the-internet#","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57945045/how-do-i-take-a-random-photo-out-of-the-results-that-come-for-a-key-word-off-t","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"How do I take a random photo (out of the results that come for a key word) off the internet and then make python show it to me?"},{"tags":["c","rewind"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":598683,"user_id":15168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WtEI9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Leffler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/15168/jonathan-leffler"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568560661,"creation_date":1568560661,"answer_id":57945469,"question_id":57945040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57945469","body_markdown":"Using `rewind()` on standard input when standard input is a terminal does nothing useful.
