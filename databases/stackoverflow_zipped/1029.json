No accusations; it&#39;s just what it is.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re trying to evaluate the expression `x + &quot;&quot; + y + &quot; &quot;` in order to print it. Because `+` is [left-associative](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18), this is evaluated as\r\n\r\n    ((x + &quot;&quot;) + y) + &quot; &quot;\r\n\r\nSo, in terms of the effect of including `&quot;&quot;`, the question is how the subexpression `x + &quot;&quot;` will be evaluated. If the `&quot;&quot;` had been omitted, it would be evaluated as\r\n\r\n    (x + y) + &quot; &quot;\r\n\r\nThere is no separate operator for &quot;numeric addition&quot; and &quot;string concatenation&quot; in Java: both use `+`. So, Java [uses a simple rule](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18) to decide between the two:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the type of either operand of a + operator is String, then the operation is string concatenation.\r\n\r\nAs such, `x + &quot;&quot;` is string concatenation, but `x + y` would be numeric addition.\r\n\r\nIf you look into [the specifics of string concatenation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18.1):\r\n\r\n&gt; If only one operand expression is of type String, then string conversion (&#167;5.1.11) is performed on the other operand to produce a string at run time.\r\n\r\nSo this is saying that the `int` in `int + String` has to be converted to a string, in order to concatenate it with another string, which is pretty reasonable. And this [string conversion](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.11) is done using:\r\n\r\n&gt; If `T` is `byte`, `short`, or `int`, then use `new Integer(x)`.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; ...\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; the conversion is performed as if by an invocation of the `toString` method of the referenced object with no arguments\r\n\r\n(&quot;as if&quot; is just wiggle room to say you don&#39;t *actually* have to invoke `new Integer(x)` - implementations could use `Integer.toString(x)`, or some other method, instead).\r\n\r\nThen, concatenation [is defined as](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-15.html#jls-15.18.1):\r\n\r\n&gt; The characters of the left-hand operand precede the characters of the right-hand operand in the newly created string.\r\n\r\nGiven that `&quot;&quot;` has no characters, it is trivially true that `someString + &quot;&quot;` will have the same characters as `someString` (*). \r\n\r\nSo, `int + &quot;&quot;` (or `&quot;&quot; + int`) is simply a syntactic trick to convert the `int` to a `String`. There is no other effect of doing this. It&#39;s just less verbose to write this than `Integer.toString(x)` or `new Integer(x).toString()`.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also worth pointing out that it would work the same had it been `&quot;&quot; + x + y + &quot; &quot;`. But that&#39;s perhaps less clear to the human eye that the `x` and `y` won&#39;t be added.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n(*) The slight detail here is that concatenation results in a *new* string (unless the two operands are constant expressions, in which case the concatenation is done at compile time), i.e. `someString + &quot;&quot; != someString`, even though `(someString + &quot;&quot;).equals(someString)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297636/the-purpose-of-double-quotes-with-integer-concatenation/58299720#58299720","title":"The purpose of double quotes (&quot;&quot;) with integer concatenation"}],"owner":{"reputation":173,"user_id":11801087,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1578205f53e480a8b765a9a4b948774e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"biscuit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11801087/biscuit"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58297657,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570688584,"creation_date":1570599211,"question_id":58297636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297636","body_markdown":"I just started the &quot;Head First Java&quot; book.

for the initial question, how to create non-compressed jpegs: one can&#39;t, for fundamental reasons. While I initially assumed that it is possible to write a non-compressing jpg encoder producing output that can be decoded with any existing decoder by manipulating the Huffman tree involved, [I had to dismiss it][3]. The Huffman encoding is just the last step of quite a pipeline of transformations, that can not be skipped. [Custom Huffman trees][4] may also break less sophisticated decoders.\r\n\r\nFor an answer that takes into consideration the requirement change made in comments (resize and compress any way you like, just give me the desired file size) one could reason this way:\r\n\r\nThe [jpeg file specification][1] defines an End of Image marker. So   chances are, that patching zeros (or just anything perhaps) afterwards make no difference. An experiment patching some images up to a specific size showed that gimp, chrome, firefox and your JpegApp swallowed such an inflated file without complaint.\r\n\r\nIt would be rather complicated to create a compression that for any image compresses precisely to your size requirement (kind of: for image A you need a compression ratio of 0.7143, for Image B 0.9356633, for C 12.445 ...). There are attempts to [predict image compression ratios][2] based on raw image data, though. \r\n\r\nSo I&#39;d propose just to resize/compress to any size &lt; 20480 and then patch it:\r\n\r\n 1. calculate the scaling ratio based on the original jpg size and the\r\n    desired size, including a safety margin to account for the\r\n    inherently vague nature of the issue\r\n\r\n 2. resize the image with that ratio\r\n\r\n 3. patch missing bytes to match exactly the desired size \r\n\r\nAs outlined here\r\n\r\n        private static void scaleAndcompress(String fileNameIn, String fileNameOut, Long desiredSize) {\r\n        try {\r\n            long size = getSize(fileNameIn);\r\n\r\n            // calculate desired ratio for conversion to stay within size limit, including a safte maring (of 10%)\r\n            // to account for the vague nature of the procedure. note, that this will also scale up if needed\r\n            double desiredRatio = (desiredSize.floatValue() / size) * (1 - SAFETY_MARGIN);\r\n\r\n            BufferedImage inImg = ImageIO.read(new File(fileNameIn));\r\n            int widthOut = round(inImg.getWidth() * desiredRatio);\r\n            int heigthOut = round(inImg.getHeight() * desiredRatio);\r\n\r\n            BufferedImage outImg = new BufferedImage(widthOut, heigthOut, BufferedImage.TYPE_INT_RGB);\r\n

Probably because it&#39;s operator overloading.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool SparseMatrix::symmetric() const\r\n{\r\n  SparseMatrix A_T(m_m,m_n);\r\n  A_T = this-&gt;transpose();\r\n  bool is_symmetric;\r\n  for (int row=0; row&lt;m_m; ++row)\r\n    {\r\n      int cols = A_T.m_colIndex[row].size();\r\n      for (int col=0; col&lt;cols; ++col)\r\n        {\r\n          array&lt;int, 2&gt; A_tuple  = {row,m_colIndex[row][col]};\r\n          array&lt;int, 2&gt; A_T_tuple  = {row,A_T.m_colIndex[row][col]};\r\n          if (A_T[A_T_tuple] == this-&gt;operator[](A_tuple))\r\n            {\r\n              is_symmetric = true;\r\n            }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdded some more code for clarity.\r\n\r\nHere is the error message.\r\n\r\n```\r\nUndefined symbols for architecture x86_64:\r\n  &quot;SparseMatrix::operator[](std::__1::array&lt;int, 2ul&gt;&amp;) const&quot;, referenced from:\r\n      SparseMatrix::symmetric() const in SparseMatrix.o\r\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64\r\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297611/c-using-this-to-use-accessor","title":"C++ using this to use accessor"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":12024030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/S7QgC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FrustratedDeveloper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12024030/frustrateddeveloper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570599195,"post_id":58297610,"comment_id":102958004,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297610/how-to-calculate-leave-balance-if-i-have-total-allotted-leaves-column-for-each-e#comment102958004_58297610"},{"owner":{"reputation":5137,"user_id":6299857,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-2Iedw5KDpA0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACuk/MUrW8xhrgig/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Prasad Telkikar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6299857/prasad-telkikar"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570599379,"post_id":58297610,"comment_id":102958058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297610/how-to-calculate-leave-balance-if-i-have-total-allotted-leaves-column-for-each-e#comment102958058_58297610"},{"owner":{"reputation":390,"user_id":6045154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BpvkV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AsheraH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6045154/asherah"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570604257,"post_id":58297610,"comment_id":102959937,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297610/how-to-calculate-leave-balance-if-i-have-total-allotted-leaves-column-for-each-e#comment102959937_58297610"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":22200,"user_id":7132550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1063981417044495/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michał Turczyn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7132550/micha%c5%82-turczyn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570600515,"creation_date":1570600515,"answer_id":58297829,"question_id":58297610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297829","body_markdown":"I can think of three solutions, since you didn&#39;t specify precisely what you want, neither sample data:\r\n\r\n1.

trying to load an image that I have stored in my /src/main/resources folder. When I do, however, I keep running into a NullPointerException that stems from the resource not being found.\r\n\r\nHere is the code snippet: \r\n```\r\n        try {\r\n            String path = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResource(&quot;bern.png&quot;).toString();\r\n        } catch (IOException ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(path);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an image of my project file tree: \r\n\r\n[![An image of my project file tree][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd here is an image of my target build file tree: \r\n\r\n[![An image of my target build file tree][2]][2]\r\n\r\nHere is the NullPointerException stacktrace: \r\nhttps://pastebin.com/KqJVxWEL\r\n\r\nI have tried using pretty well every possible path for the image file that I can think of. (/src/main/resources/bern.png, src/main/resources/bern.png, /bern.png, etc.).\r\n\r\nI have also tried using `getClass().getClassLoader().getResource()` instead of `getClass().getResource()`. From what I understand, the only difference between the `Class` and `ClassLoader` version of `getResource()` is that the `Class` version is not inherently absolute relative to the root, whereas the `ClassLoader` version is. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I run `getClass().getResource(&quot;&quot;).toPath()`, I get the path that leads to the `classes` directory. This aligns with what I&#39;ve read about the `getResource()` method working with the target build file tree. However, I don&#39;t see the resources folder showing up anywhere in the target build; I think that&#39;s the core of my problem. I&#39;m just not sure how to fix it. \r\n\r\nI know this question has been asked numerous times before, but the answers to the other version of this question haven&#39;t helped me out much. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using NetBeans 11, and this project is running on the Maven build system. I haven&#39;t done much work with Maven in the past, so forgive me if this problem is extremely easy to fix. \r\n\r\nAnyone know how I&#39;m approaching this wrong? \r\n\r\nEDIT: The problem is not anything with my project structure or code as shown by the code compiling correctly when run using `mvn` via the command line. As a result, it&#39;s an issue with NetBeans specifically and the way that it is viewing the resources folder. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/D0U5x.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3mmuo.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297606/cant-access-file-in-resources-folder","title":"Can&#39;t Access File in Resources Folder"},{"tags":["php","mysql","database","laravel-5"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":27350,"user_id":2500658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Tl1Hr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sougata Bose","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2500658/sougata-bose"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570599631,"post_id":58297605,"comment_id":102958140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297605/how-to-connection-multiple-databases-in-laravel-5-5#comment102958140_58297605"},{"owner":{"reputation":3043,"user_id":5255147,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGBy9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zain Farooq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5255147/zain-farooq"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570600378,"post_id":58297605,"comment_id":102958350,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297605/how-to-connection-multiple-databases-in-laravel-5-5#comment102958350_58297605"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":11183608,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3bbcc5e9b025458b0a7ab0ea4a7c2aa9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kurapika","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11183608/kurapika"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570602022,"creation_date":1570602022,"answer_id":58298074,"question_id":58297605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298074","body_markdown":"I think you can refer to this [How to make database query inside a config file?][1]\r\nwhere u can query the database and put it in your config file.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43789071/how-to-make-database-query-inside-a-config-file","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297605/how-to-connection-multiple-databases-in-laravel-5-5/58298074#58298074","title":"How to connection multiple databases in laravel 5.5?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10710230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e1aed5d5a23cdcd6afcc223318fd9c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Una","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10710230/una"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570604999,"creation_date":1570604999,"answer_id":58298808,"question_id":58297605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298808","body_markdown":"I found a solution.

The outer loop runs from `0` to `m`. The inner loop from `i + 1` to `m`.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Iteration counting ##\r\n\r\nWe need to count how often the inner statement which you labeled `O(1)` is executed. That is, how often the inner loop runs in total, as executed by the outer loop. So let us take a look.\r\n\r\nThe first iteration of the outer loop generates `m - 1` iterations of the inner loop. The second generates `m - 1`, then `m - 2`, `m - 3`, `m - 4`, ..., `2`, `1`, `0`.\r\n\r\nThat means that the `O(1)` statement is, in total, executed:\r\n\r\n    (m - 1) + (m - 2) + (m - 3) + ... + 2 + 1 + 0\r\n\r\nThat is the sum from `0` up to `m - 1`\r\n\r\n    sum_{i = 0}^{m - 1} i\r\n\r\nwhich can be simplified to\r\n\r\n    (m^2 - m) / 2\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Substitute back ##\r\n\r\nLet us now substitute back `m = n / 2 - 1`, we get\r\n\r\n    ((n / 2 - 1)^2 - (n / 2 - 1)) / 2\r\n\r\nAfter simplifying, this is\r\n\r\n    n^2/8 - 3n/4 + 1\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Big-O ##\r\n\r\nFor Big-O, we observe that it is smaller than\r\n\r\n      n^2 - 0 + n^2\r\n    = 2n^2\r\n\r\nWhich, by definition is `O(n^2)`.\r\n\r\nAs you see, this bound is also tight. So we also receive `Omega(n^2)` which also concludes `Theta(n^2)`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297511/how-to-do-this-nested-for-loop-time-complexity/58297737#58297737","title":"How to do this nested for loop time complexity?"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":5335162,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12195c79b137dbbed23ad565cc1e0e54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ravsmy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5335162/ravsmy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58297558,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570599987,"creation_date":1570598421,"question_id":58297511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297511","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to figure out this time complexity:\r\n\r\n    for(i=0; i&lt;=(n/2)-1; i++){\r\n        for (j=i+1; j&lt;=(n/2)-1; j++){\r\n            --some O(1) thing--                \r\n        }   \r\n    } \r\n\r\nThe outer loop I understand to be on its own O(n/2.)

So this is your program from the begin to the end statement without that extra readln().\r\n\r\nFor this code the routine is simple and there is actually more than one method that I can think of. For the first method, you can read each line into an array. Then traverse through the array and create a random number of 0 or 1. If it is 1 print that line. \r\n\r\nFor the second method, each time read a line from the file, generate a random number of 0 or 1. If that random number is a 1, print that line. \r\n\r\nTake note to use randomize before you run random() to not get the same random number of the last program execution. Another thing to take into consideration, if you going on a large text file, each set length can cost a lot. It is better to keep track of what going in there and set 20 - 30 length as one or even 100.

Your first `Readln` reads the first line of the file into `s`, but you don&#39;t use this value at all. It is lost. The first time you do a `Readln` in the loop, you get the second line of the file (which you do print to the console using `Writeln`).\r\n\r\n2. Your `arr` record type is completely meaningless in this case (and in most cases), since it is a record without any members. It cannot store any data, because it has no members.\r\n\r\n3. In your loop, you expand the length of the array, one item at a time. But you don&#39;t set the new item&#39;s value to anything, so you do this in vain. (And, because of the previous point, there isn&#39;t any value to set in any case: the elements of the array are empty records that cannot contain any data.)\r\n\r\n4. Increasing the length of a dynamic array one item at a time is [very bad practice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5756206/282848), because it might cause a new heap allocation each time. The entire existing array might need to be copied to a new location in your computer&#39;s memory, every time.\r\n\r\n5. The contents of the loop seem to be trying to do two things: saving the current line in the array, and printing it to the console. I assume the latter is only for debugging?\r\n\r\n6. Old-style Pascal I/O (`text`, `Assign`, `Reset`) is obsolete. It is not thread-safe, possibly slow, handles Unicode badly, etc. It was used in the 90s, but shouldn&#39;t be used today. Instead, use the facilities provided by your RTL. (In Delphi, for instance, you can use `TStringList`, `IOUtils.TFile.ReadAllLines`, streams, etc.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA partly fixed version of the code might look like this (still using old-school Pascal I/O and the inefficient array handling):\r\n\r\n    program Project1;\r\n    \r\n    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\r\n    \r\n    {$R *.res}\r\n    \r\n    uses\r\n      System.SysUtils;\r\n    \r\n    var\r\n      x: text;\r\n      arr: array of string;\r\n    \r\n    begin\r\n    \r\n      // Load file to string array (old and inefficient way)\r\n      AssignFile(x, &#39;D:\\test.txt&#39;);\r\n      Reset(x);\r\n      try\r\n        while not Eof(x) do\r\n        begin\r\n          SetLength(arr, Length(arr) + 1);\r\n          Readln(x, arr[High(Arr)]);\r\n        end;\r\n      finally\r\n        CloseFile(x);\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n      Randomize;\r\n    \r\n      // Print strings randomly\r\n      while True do\r\n      begin\r\n        Writeln(Arr[Random(Length(Arr))]);\r\n        Readln;\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    end.\r\n\r\nIf you want to fix the inefficient array issue, but still not use modern classes, allocate in chunks:\r\n\r\n    program Project1;\r\n    \r\n    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\r\n    \r\n    {$R *.res}\r\n    \r\n    uses\r\n      System.SysUtils;\r\n    \r\n    var\r\n      x: text;\r\n      s: string;\r\n      arr: array of string;\r\n      ActualLength: Integer;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      procedure AddLineToArr(const ALine: string);\r\n      begin\r\n        if Length(arr) = ActualLength then\r\n          SetLength(arr, Round(1.5 * Length(arr)) + 1);\r\n        arr[ActualLength] := ALine;\r\n        Inc(ActualLength);\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    begin\r\n    \r\n      SetLength(arr, 1024);\r\n      ActualLength := 0; // not necessary, since a global variable is always initialized\r\n    \r\n      // Load file to string array (old and inefficient way)\r\n      AssignFile(x, &#39;D:\\test.txt&#39;);\r\n      Reset(x);\r\n      try\r\n        while not Eof(x) do\r\n        begin\r\n          Readln(x, s);\r\n          AddLineToArr(s);\r\n        end;\r\n      finally\r\n        CloseFile(x);\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n      SetLength(arr, ActualLength);\r\n    \r\n      Randomize;\r\n    \r\n      // Print strings randomly\r\n      while True do\r\n      begin\r\n        Writeln(Arr[Random(Length(Arr))]);\r\n        Readln;\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    end.\r\n\r\nBut if you have access to modern classes, things get much easier. The following examples use the modern Delphi RTL:\r\n\r\nThe generic `TList&lt;T&gt;` handles efficient expansion automatically:\r\n\r\n    program Project1;\r\n    \r\n    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\r\n    \r\n    {$R *.res}\r\n    \r\n    uses\r\n      System.SysUtils, Generics.Defaults, Generics.Collections;\r\n    \r\n    var\r\n      x: text;\r\n      s: string;\r\n      list: TList&lt;string&gt;;\r\n    \r\n    begin\r\n    \r\n      list := TList&lt;string&gt;.Create;\r\n      try\r\n    \r\n        // Load file to string array (old and inefficient way)\r\n        AssignFile(x, &#39;D:\\test.txt&#39;);\r\n        Reset(x);\r\n        try\r\n          while not Eof(x) do\r\n          begin\r\n            Readln(x, s);\r\n            list.Add(s);\r\n          end;\r\n        finally\r\n          CloseFile(x);\r\n        end;\r\n    \r\n        Randomize;\r\n    \r\n        // Print strings randomly\r\n        while True do\r\n        begin\r\n          Writeln(list[Random(list.Count)]);\r\n          Readln;\r\n        end;\r\n    \r\n      finally\r\n        list.Free;\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    end.\r\n\r\nBut you could simply use a `TStringList`:\r\n\r\n    program Project1;\r\n    \r\n    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\r\n    \r\n    {$R *.res}\r\n    \r\n    uses\r\n      System.SysUtils, Classes;\r\n    \r\n    var\r\n      list: TStringList;\r\n    \r\n    begin\r\n    \r\n      list := TStringList.Create;\r\n      try\r\n    \r\n        list.LoadFromFile(&#39;D:\\test.txt&#39;);\r\n    \r\n        Randomize;\r\n    \r\n        // Print strings randomly\r\n        while True do\r\n        begin\r\n          Writeln(list[Random(list.Count)]);\r\n          Readln;\r\n        end;\r\n    \r\n      finally\r\n        list.Free;\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    end.\r\n\r\nOr you could keep the array approach and use `IOUtils.TFile.ReadAllLines`:\r\n\r\n    program Project1;\r\n    \r\n    {$APPTYPE CONSOLE}\r\n    \r\n    {$R *.res}\r\n    \r\n    uses\r\n      System.SysUtils, IOUtils;\r\n    \r\n    var\r\n      arr: TArray&lt;string&gt;;\r\n    \r\n    begin\r\n    \r\n      arr := TFile.ReadAllLines(&#39;D:\\test.txt&#39;);\r\n    \r\n      Randomize;\r\n    \r\n      // Print strings randomly\r\n      while True do\r\n      begin\r\n        Writeln(arr[Random(Length(arr))]);\r\n        Readln;\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    end.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the modern approaches are much more convenient (less code). They are also faster and give you Unicode support.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*Note:* All snippets above assume that the file contains at least a single line. They will fail if this is not the case, and in real/production code, you *must* verify this, e.g. like \r\n\r\n      if Length(arr) = 0 then\r\n        raise Exception.Create(&#39;Array is empty.&#39;);\r\n\r\nor\r\n    \r\n      if List.Count = 0 then\r\n        raise Exception.Create(&#39;List is empty.&#39;);\r\n\r\nbefore the `// Print strings randomly` part, which _assumes_ that the array/list isn&#39;t empty.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297496/reading-string-from-a-text-file-into-array-in-pascal/58298368#58298368","title":"Reading String from a text file into Array in Pascal"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12170282,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7528f1d166ff8970531c37aa3c40515b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170282/christian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":75897,"user_id":282848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ced1d4c4fa1cd38d87553bf0e4836120?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andreas Rejbrand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/282848/andreas-rejbrand"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":150,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58298368,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570646978,"creation_date":1570598307,"last_edit_date":1570603737,"question_id":58297496,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297496","body_markdown":"With this program, I am trying to read a file and randomly print it to console.

ABC\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd below is my code.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype\r\n  arr = record \r\n  end;\r\n\r\nvar\r\n  x: text;\r\n  s: string;\r\n  SpacePos: word;\r\n  myArray: array of arr;\r\n  i: byte;\r\n\r\nbegin\r\n  Assign(x, &#39;text.txt&#39;);\r\n  reset(x);\r\n  readln(x, s); \r\n  SetLength(myArray, 0);\r\n  while not eof(x) do\r\n  begin\r\n    SetLength(myArray, Length(myArray) + 1);\r\n    readln(x, s);\r\n    WriteLn(s);\r\n  end;\r\nend.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how I could approach this problem!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297496/reading-string-from-a-text-file-into-array-in-pascal","title":"Reading String from a text file into Array in Pascal"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","api","callback","return-value"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":12186001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ecb21b04e480d409b445e0a290d3a50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AoiYamada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12186001/aoiyamada"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570600586,"creation_date":1570600586,"answer_id":58297841,"question_id":58297495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297841","body_markdown":"The function getXXX cannot get the &quot;return&quot; inside the callback function.\r\n\r\nAnd you did not call res.json to send the result to the client.\r\n\r\nYou could pass res to getXXX and use it in this way:\r\n\r\n    function getCity(userip, res) {\r\n      var url = `https://ipinfo.io/${userip}/json`;\r\n      request(url, (err, respone, body) =&gt; {\r\n        var data = JSON.parse(body);\r\n        var city = data[&#39;city&#39;];\r\n        return getLocationKey(city, res);\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function getLocationKey(city, res) {\r\n      var url = `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search?q=${city}&amp;apikey=${API_KEY}`;\r\n      request(url, (err, respone, body) =&gt; {\r\n        var data = JSON.parse(body);\r\n        var key = data[0].Key;\r\n        return getWeather(key, res);\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function getWeather(key, res) {\r\n      var url = `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/forecasts/v1/daily/1day/${key}?apikey=${API_KEY}`;\r\n      request(url, (err, respone, body) =&gt; {\r\n        var weather = JSON.parse(body);\r\n        console.log(&quot;weather: &quot; + weather);\r\n        res.json(weather);\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    router.get(&#39;/weather&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n      publicIp.v4()\r\n        .then(userip =&gt; {\r\n          getCity(userip, res);\r\n        })\r\n        .catch(err =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;Error: &#39; + err);\r\n        })\r\n    })","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297495/how-to-return-value-from-a-function-to-use-it-and-respone-it-in-router-in-nodejs/58297841#58297841","title":"How to return value from a function to use it and respone it in router in Nodejs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12129051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cdbGa.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ladydev44","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12129051/ladydev44"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58297841,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570600586,"creation_date":1570598297,"question_id":58297495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297495","body_markdown":"I am trying to get result from function getWeather() in Nodejs to respone it to json in one router but I can not get it. \r\n```\r\nvar request = require(&#39;request&#39;);\r\nvar publicIp = require(&#39;public-ip&#39;);\r\n\r\nfunction getCity (userip){ \r\n  var url = `https://ipinfo.io/${userip}/json`;\r\n  request(url, (err, respone, body)=&gt;{\r\n    var data = JSON.parse(body);\r\n    var city = data[&#39;city&#39;];\r\n    return getLocationKey(city);\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getLocationKey(city){\r\n  var url = `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/locations/v1/cities/search?q=${city}&amp;apikey=${API_KEY}`;\r\n  request(url, (err, respone, body)=&gt;{\r\n    var data = JSON.parse(body);\r\n    var key = data[0].Key;\r\n    return getWeather(key);\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction getWeather(key){\r\n  var url =  `http://dataservice.accuweather.com/forecasts/v1/daily/1day/${key}?apikey=${API_KEY}`;  \r\n  request(url, (err, respone, body)=&gt;{\r\n      var weather = JSON.parse(body);\r\n      console.log(&quot;weather: &quot; + weather);\r\n      return weather;\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI have got result from getCity() and getLocationKey(), but when get final result from getWeather() is not successfull.\r\nI console.log weather is Object object.

Your Single Read Sampler configuration is not correct, i.e. wrong protocol/host/port/path/etc. Cross check the settings with i.e. [browser developer tools][2]. For example you&#39;re using `wss` protocol with port `80` however the port should be `443` or something like that\r\n 2. Your application doesn&#39;t automatically send frames over the established connection, to wit it requires some input from your side. If this is the case make sure to send something to the endpoint using i.e. WebSocket Single Write Sampler \r\n\r\nYou might find [Single read sample.jmx][3] example test plan useful. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nIf you will be experiencing problems consider adding the following lines to *log4j2.xml* file (lives in &quot;bin&quot; folder of your JMeter installation)\r\n\r\n    &lt;Logger name=&quot;eu.luminis&quot; level=&quot;debug&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nthen restart JMeter and re-run your test and look into [*jmeter.log*][4] file - it should contain verbose debugging information on what&#39;s going on under the hood, most probably you will be able to figure out the cause of the problem from there. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

have set up a pipeline in an Azure Data Factory and am attempting to represent it as an ARM template that the entire factory can be easily redeployed. One particularly long Expression in a Stored Procedure activity works perfectly fine in the ADF, but when I copy the code into my ARM template and deploy via Azure DevOps, the Expression is replaced with simply `[object Object]`.\r\n\r\nThe Stored Procedure in question runs on an Azure SQL server (deployed at the same time as my ARM template) and records a time in the future calculated based on parameters to the pipeline. As the parameters allow for seconds/minutes/hours/days to be specified, the calculation Expression is quite long.\r\n\r\nThe Stored Procedure activity in my ADF has the following `typeProperties` element:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n&quot;typeProperties&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;storedProcedureName&quot;: &quot;ctrl.uspInsertTableLog&quot;,\r\n  &quot;storedProcedureParameters&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;nextUpdate&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;type&quot;: &quot;DateTime&quot;,\r\n      &quot;value&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Expression&quot;,\r\n          &quot;value&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Expression&quot;,\r\n              &quot;value&quot;: &quot;@string(if(equals(toLower(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateUnit),&#39;minute&#39;),addminutes(pipeline().TriggerTime,int(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateLength)),if(equals(toLower(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateUnit),&#39;hour&#39;),addhours(pipeline().TriggerTime,int(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateLength)),if(equals(toLower(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateUnit),&#39;day&#39;),adddays(pipeline().TriggerTime,int(pipeline().parameters.nextUpdateLength)),pipeline().TriggerTime))))&quot;\r\n          }\r\n       }\r\n    },\r\n    ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI copied this code into my ARM template and deployed it via Azure DevOps pipelines. When I check my newly-deployed Stored Procedure activity, the line with the long expression has been replaced with:\r\n```json\r\n              &quot;value&quot;: &quot;[object Object]&quot;,\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe rest of the template deploys without a hitch.\r\n\r\nI expect the code I deploy to remain as it was typed, and not be changed to this blank object (which causes the Stored Proc to throw an error).\r\n\r\nAm I missing a restriction on what we are allowed to do with functions in ADF?

What I want to do is dismiss the entire navigation stack and end up back at the root view.\r\n\r\nSwiping down to dismiss the modal produces the desired result, but I want to do this programatically with the button.\r\n\r\nIs this currently possible in SwiftUI, or is this a problem with using `NavigationView` within a modal sheet?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297472/swiftui-dismiss-multiple-modal-sheets","title":"SwiftUI Dismiss Multiple Modal Sheets"},{"tags":["django","django-rest-framework","django-middleware"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2867,"user_id":5099803,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d1bce3247722e1ae71f2090a342bc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dipen Dadhaniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5099803/dipen-dadhaniya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2867,"user_id":5099803,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d1bce3247722e1ae71f2090a342bc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dipen Dadhaniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5099803/dipen-dadhaniya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570599067,"last_edit_date":1570599067,"creation_date":1570598328,"answer_id":58297499,"question_id":58297471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297499","body_markdown":"Simply do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom django.shortcuts import get_object_or_404\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nclass MessMiddleWare(object):\r\n    def __init__(self, get_response):\r\n        self.get_response = get_response\r\n\r\n    def __call__(self, request):\r\n        mycustom = MyCustom.objects.filter(id=request.user.pk)\r\n        # Instead of using filter, consider doing (if it fits your usecase):\r\n        # mycustom = get_object_or_404(MyCustom, pk=request.user.pk)\r\n        request.mycustom = mycustom\r\n        response = self.get_response(request)\r\n        return response\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo not forget to add your middleware in `MIDDLEWARE` of `settings.py`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that it should be `object` and not `obect`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRead more about writing custom middlewares in [Django&#39;s official documentation][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/middleware/#writing-your-own-middleware","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297471/django-writing-middleware-to-extend-self-request/58297499#58297499","title":"Django writing Middleware to extend self.request"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12185960"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570599058,"accepted_answer_id":58297499,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570599067,"creation_date":1570598188,"question_id":58297471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58297471","body_markdown":"I am very new to writing custom middleware in Django.\r\n\r\nWe know in Django, there is built-in `self.request`. in `self.request`, there are too many instances like `self.request.user`, `self.request.data`, `self.request.authenticator` etc\r\n\r\n\r\nI am trying to add `self.request.mycustom`;

       values = list(data)\r\n        # print(values)\r\n        # integer encode\r\n        label_encoder = LabelEncoder()\r\n        integer_encoded = label_encoder.fit_transform(values)\r\n        print(integer_encoded)\r\n        # one hot encode\r\n        encoded = to_categorical(integer_encoded)\r\n        print(encoded)\r\n        # invert encoding\r\n        inverted = argmax(encoded[0])\r\n        print(inverted)\r\n        onehot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)\r\n        integer_encoded = integer_encoded.reshape(len(integer_encoded), 1)\r\n        onehot_encoded = onehot_encoder.fit_transform(integer_encoded)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not affecting the dataset, when I print the `df.head()` it&#39;s still the same, what&#39;s wrong here?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58297448/apply-one-hot-encoding-on-a-dataframe-in-python","title":"Apply one hot encoding on a dataframe in
