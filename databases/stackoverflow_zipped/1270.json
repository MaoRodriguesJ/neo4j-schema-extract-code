Then your artisan command simply fires off this new job or event each time is executed.\r\n\r\nThis is also somehow stated in the docs as a best practice:\r\n\r\n&gt; For greater code reuse, it is good practice to keep your console commands light and let them defer to application services to accomplish their tasks.\r\n\r\nThen if you look at the documentation about jobs, there is a section about error handling for failed jobs where you are told that you can define a method that gets triggered once he job has failed. Example excerpt taken from the docs:\r\n```php\r\nclass YourJob implements ShouldQueue\r\n{\r\n    /**\r\n     * Execute the job.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  AudioProcessor  $processor\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function handle(AudioProcessor $processor)\r\n    {\r\n        // Process uploaded podcast...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * The job failed to process.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  Exception  $exception\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function failed(Exception $exception)\r\n    {\r\n        // Send user notification of failure, etc...\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can read more [in the documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/queues#cleaning-up-after-failed-jobs).

I always think that each process has own mapping of the dependent module to his own memory, but now it seems not so. \r\n\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n\r\n 1. Why do I get *&quot;not valid&quot;* when trying to translate **0x00400000** address?\r\n 2. Please, clear the situation with **kernel32.dll** and my doubts about mapping the module to each process.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 0**:\r\nI don&#39;t know why, but when I debug the kernel as local - I see the same value in **ALL** registers. I&#39;ve tried to remote debug the kernel, and now I see the different values for each register:\r\n\r\n    cr0\tValue: 80010033\r\n    cr2\tValue: 909a301c\r\n    cr3\tValue: 001a8000\r\n    cr4\tValue: 000406e9\r\n\r\nAnd now, I can&#39;t get either **kernel32.dll** or the other modules translation.\r\nThe main questions are opened.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/converting-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses\r\n  [2]: https://ntcore.com/?page_id=388\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_register#CR4\r\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_Address_Extension\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/N14aw.png\r\n  [6]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-pte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240242/how-to-translate-virtual-to-physical-address-windbg","title":"How to translate Virtual to Physical Address (WinDbg)?"},{"tags":["amazon-s3","databricks","aws-glue","delta-lake"],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":10774129,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/678f92da3de2b6dfabd9306729b46ab8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kushagra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10774129/kushagra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570207082,"creation_date":1570207082,"question_id":58240241,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240241","body_markdown":"I am trying to migrate my Hive metadata to Glue.

So to summarize it I have two methods that check how many mail items a specific user has and another one that returns the mail item that is first in the users mailbox, (by LIFO rule).\r\n\r\nSo while if a user both A.Has a mailbox and B.Has at least 1 mail in said mailbox there isn&#39;t a problem, this doesn&#39;t really work when a and/or b isn&#39;t true. And that is what I tried to fix. I thought it would be as simple as checking both if the mailbox.containsKey(who)==false and/or mailbox.get(who).get(0) == null would be enough but when I do this i get java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException: Index: 0, Size: 0. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried multiple types of either checking if it&#39;s ==true/false null etc.. I&#39;ve tried to just throw the exception all together but nothing seems to work and while maybe throwing the exception could work in some way I would want to solve it in another way as the throw command seems a bit lazy\r\n\r\nHere is my method in which I check both A and B:\r\n```java\r\nprivate boolean errorHandling(String who){  \r\n    if (mailbox.containsKey(who)==false ||  mailbox.get(who).get(0) == null    ){ \r\n        return true;  \r\n    }\r\n    else{\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this method is utilized by these two methods:\r\n```\r\npublic MailItem getNextMailItem(String who)\r\n{\r\n    if (!errorHandling(who) ){   \r\n        MailItem item2 = mailbox.get(who).get(0);\r\n        mailbox.get(who).remove(0);\r\n        return item2;\r\n    } else{\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;that user dosent have a mailbox&quot;);\r\n        return null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic int howManyMailItems(String who)\r\n{\r\n    if (!errorHandling(who) ){  //To check if user has a mailbox\r\n        return mailbox.get(who).size();\r\n    }\r\n    else{\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;that user dosent have a mailbox&quot;);\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not sure if you need more of my code to help me or not. Tell me if that is the case but to clarify, the &quot;mailbox&quot; is the hashmap and the who parameter is the person you want to check his or her mailbox.

format string you pass to `printf` is a mixture of ordinary characters and *format specifiers*.  The ordinary characters print as themselves, and the format specifiers cause one of the extra arguments to be converted and printed.  But the type of each extra argument *must* match the type expected by the format specifiers, more or less exactly.\r\n\r\nWe can tell from the warning message that `pid` is an `int`.  So the correct format specifier is `%d`.\r\n\r\nThe specifier `%lu` would have been correct if `pid` had type `unsigned long int`.\r\n\r\nFormat specifiers are sort of their own little miniature programming language.  The basic format specifier for type `unsigned int` is `%u`, and you can modify it to print `unsigned long int` instead with the `l` (letter ell) modifier: `%lu`.\r\n\r\nBut when you write `%lun`, the `n` wasn&#39;t actually part of any format specifier, so it printed as itself.\r\n\r\n(Also, you got lucky: despite the mismatch between `pid`&#39;s type and the format specifier `%lu`, you got a sensible value printed anyway.)\r\n\r\nUsually, getting the arguments and the format specifiers to line up is easy: `int` for `%d`, `unsigned int` for `%u` or `%x`, `long int` for `%ld`, `float` or `double` for `%f`, etc.  But what&#39;s the right specifier to use for `pid`, which has type `pid_t`?  Today, on your computer, it looks like `pid_t` is an `int`, so `%d` would be correct, but what if, on some other computer, it has a different type?  How can you write one piece of code that will work correctly on any computer?  One way is to pick a type that&#39;s probably right, and use the specifier for that type, and then use an explicit *cast* to convert your value to the type you picked.  Like this:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;pid: %d\\n&quot;, (int)pid);\r\n\r\nOr like this:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;pid: %lu\\n&quot;, (unsigned long int)pid);\r\n\r\nIf the cast isn&#39;t necessary (if the format specifier you picked is already correct for the type of `pid` on your computer), the cast won&#39;t hurt.\r\n\r\nFinally, congratulations on using a compiler that actually gave you the warning message:\r\n\r\n&gt; warning: format specifies type &#39;unsigned long&#39; but the argument has type &#39;pid_t&#39; (aka &#39;int&#39;)\r\n\r\nToo many beginning programmers are stuck using older compilers that don&#39;t print warnings like these, and that obviously makes it much more difficult to track down problems caused by mismatched format specifiers!  (Your compiler was particularly helpful in that it gave you both the apparent type of `pid`, namely `pid_t`, and also the actual underlying type, `int`.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240207/please-why-is-this-code-printing-with-an-extra-n-when-i-run-it/58240304#58240304","title":"Please, why is this code printing with an extra &quot;n&quot; when I run it?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12165494,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d045b0e503fd8accd823fb6c67aabc72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jennylearner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12165494/jennylearner"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570208207,"creation_date":1570206890,"question_id":58240207,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240207","body_markdown":"I am trying to get the pid using this code.

I can&#39;t use any ES6 code, just plain old vanilla JS and jQuery. \r\n\r\nThe context: on a web page there are several pairs of inputs, the first input from the pair triggers the `firstFunction()` on blur and the second input the `secondFunction()` also on the blur event. As you can see from the sample code bellow, each function then calls another function, `ajaxFunction()` which performs an AJAX request. \r\n\r\nThe goal: I want to be able to invoke the `ajaxFunction()` only if there isn&#39;t another AJAX request in progress from a previous function invokement. The thing is that when it&#39;s run for the first time on a pair of inputs, a new row is created in the database and the request returns the ID of the row. So when it&#39;s called the second time, it will be an UPDATE in the database instead of an INSERT because of the ID. If the second call from the pair runs before the first one finished, I end up having two distinct rows in the database, which is not desired.\r\n\r\nExample: if the user enters some text in the first input, then the `firstFunction()` is triggered on blur, then he quickly moves to the second input and enters something so the `secondFunction()` is triggered on blur, but it may be the case that the AJAX request from the `firstFunction()` call hasn&#39;t been completed yet. So the AJAX call from the `secondFunction()` should start only if the one from the `firstFunction()` has been completed. The same logic applies for the case when the user starts typing in the second input and the in the first one. \r\n\r\nNote: this aren&#39;t the only AJAX requests on the page, there are several others as well. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve done some research and I feel like `$.when()` is what I need, but it beats me when it comes to integrating it in this logic. I also thought about `$.active` but it doesn&#39;t really help.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction firstFunction() {\r\n\t// Some logic goes here then we call the AJAX function.\t\r\n\tajaxFunction(1, 2, 3);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction secondFunction() {\r\n\t// Some logic goes here then we call the AJAX function.\t\r\n\tajaxFunction(4, 5, 6);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction ajaxFunction(param1, param2, param3) {\r\n\t$.ajax({\r\n  \t\tmethod: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n  \t\turl: &quot;https://website.localhost&quot;,\r\n  \t\tdata: { \r\n  \t\t\tparam1: param1\r\n  \t\t\tparam2: param2\r\n  \t\t\tparam3: param3\r\n  \t\t}\r\n\t}).done(function() {\r\n    \tconsole.log(&#39;Done!&#39;);\r\n  \t});\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240199/perform-ajax-call-only-if-there-isnt-another-ajax-request-in-progress-from-a-pr","title":"Perform AJAX call only if there isn&#39;t another AJAX request in progress from a previous function invokement"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html",".htaccess"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":12043307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBtjYmWJ_yTer-Sh5xTAYZbF2mSD3FNb_7gb3oYmA=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Daniel Lima","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12043307/daniel-lima"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53,"user_id":12043307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBtjYmWJ_yTer-Sh5xTAYZbF2mSD3FNb_7gb3oYmA=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Daniel Lima","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12043307/daniel-lima"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570208066,"last_edit_date":1570208066,"creation_date":1570207660,"answer_id":58240373,"question_id":58240198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58240373","body_markdown":"I had that problem before and I use this part of code on my **.htaccess**\r\n\r\nHere is the code to &quot;force&quot; the WWW. on your link:\r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine On\r\n    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST}  !^www\\.website\\.com$ [NC]\r\n    RewriteRule ^(.*) http://www.website.com/$1 [L,R]\r\n\r\n**OR**\r\n\r\nLook at your *Host Panel*, there you can check everything about domains and redirecting.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240198/http-or-www-to-https-redirect-not-working/58240373#58240373","title":"http or www to https redirect not working"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":2926050,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7979cbb908610353db3b36dc0a58f9ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2926050","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2926050/user2926050"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570464804,"post_id":58240384,"comment_id":102913500,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240198/http-or-www-to-https-redirect-not-working/58240384#comment102913500_58240384"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":6734443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5a6db4ea73cc2c598075bc0484c74a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Levente Gabos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6734443/levente-gabos"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570207721,"creation_date":1570207721,"answer_id":58240384,"question_id":58240198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58240384","body_markdown":"try following on top of your .htaccess:\r\n\r\n        RewriteEngine On\r\n        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} !=on\r\n        RewriteRule ^.*$ https://%{SERVER_NAME}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L]\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240198/http-or-www-to-https-redirect-not-working/58240384#58240384","title":"http or www to https redirect not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":2926050,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7979cbb908610353db3b36dc0a58f9ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2926050","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2926050/user2926050"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58240384,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570208066,"creation_date":1570206855,"question_id":58240198,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240198","body_markdown":"My website should be redirecting all links to my website to the https:// domain, but when typed in certain ways it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.example.com --- works\r\n\r\nexample.com --- works\r\n\r\nwww.example.com --- doesn&#39;t work, goes to http://...\r\n\r\nThe website calls a global header and footer from a separate file.

Basically you&#39;re just guessing numbers from an array of 20 randomly generated numbers. It&#39;s supposed to print out all of the numbers in the array after you have either used your three tries or guessed one of the numbers right. To make sure my program works I moved the the function that prints the array to the top so I could see the numbers in the array. When I try this it works correctly some times then when my code convinces me it works I move the print out function down after the for loop that says whether you got it or not and the program stops working. Then I move the print out function back up to the top to try and fix it and it feels like a 50/50 chance whether it works or not. \r\n\r\n1. Assign makes all of the numbers in the array wins 0\r\n2.

My job is to create/implement malloc/free functions in C using “Explicit free list among only the free blocks” technique. I have already studied a lot of materials, but I am still stuck at some point and I do not understand some details. So my job is to create 4 functions – initialize(), allocate() ,free() and check(). I can use only one global variable `void *memory` – this is the block  in which I can allocate my memory using alloc().\r\n\r\nSo I wanted to implement this using doubly linked-list and I created a structure:\r\n\r\n    typedef struct memoryBlock{\r\n    \tstruct memoryBlock *prev,*next;\r\n    }memoryBlock;\r\n\r\nAnd the structure for the header:\r\n\r\n    typedef struct header{\r\n    int size;\r\n    }header;\r\n\r\nI was advised in my class to create a separate structure for a free memory block and another separate structure for an allocated block. My first idea was to distinguish the free/allocated blocks using one bit of the block size in header – set it to 1 if the block is allocated and 0 if it is free. ( I saw this technique used in implicit lists). So my question is: do I need to create a `freeBlock` and `allocatedBlock` structure for an explicit list or can I just use the one bit of the size?\r\n\r\nThe second question is: do I need a separate structure for the header/footer of the block? Or can I just write the size of the block in the header/footer as `*(int *)ptr = size;` ? I tried to use this in the initialize() function:\r\n\r\n    void initialize(void *ptr, int size){\r\n    memory = ptr;\r\n    *(int *)memory = size; //header\r\n    *((int *)memory + size) = size; //footer\r\n    }\r\nIs this  correct, please? \r\n\r\nMany thanks for any

It simply keeps a one-byte buffer into which you\r\n&gt; put bits until you have eight bits. Then write than byte, clear the\r\n&gt; buffer, and start over. The process is reversed on the other side.\r\n&gt; When you get to the end, just write the last byte buffer if not empty\r\n&gt; with the remainder of the bits set to zero.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; You only need to figure out how many bits are required for each symbol\r\n&gt; at the current state of the compression. That same determination can\r\n&gt; be made on the other side when pulling bits from the stream.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m working on a LZW algorithm right now and this above part I don&#39;t understand how to do. I have the base code and it works, but now I&#39;m trying to implement what the answer says. Firstly, for the buffer, it says that when I have 8 bits or (12 bits) in the buffer, let&#39;s go with 12 bits buffer of 3 bytes for now because 12 bits allows more combination in my dictionary. I&#39;ll write the byte to the file, but my codes are all in 7 bits: For example, L is code 76 in ascii and 76 converts to 1001100 in binary (7 bits) In this case I&#39;ll add a 0&#39;s in the beginning until I get 12 bits?

And make the `:lang` to be an optional `?`.\r\n\r\nSo something like this should work: `path: &#39;/:lang(de|fr|en|zu)?&#39;` At least it works for me :) ...\r\n\r\nSo now if you request `/about` or `/de/about` both would match `About`.. however the first one will have `params.lang` === undefined. So I guess whenever you set your locale you can do: `const locale = this.$route.params.lang || &#39;en&#39;`  \r\n\r\nhere is the documentation for [Advanced Matching Patterns][1]\r\n\r\n```js\r\nroutes: [{\r\n  path: &#39;/:lang(de|fr|en|zu)?&#39;,\r\n  component: {\r\n    template: &#39;&lt;router-view /&gt;&#39;\r\n  },\r\n  children: [\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;home&#39;,\r\n      component: Home\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;about&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;about&#39;,\r\n      component: About\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;contact&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;contact&#39;,\r\n      component: Contact\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/dynamic-matching.html#advanced-matching-patterns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240149/how-to-add-an-i18n-locale-prefix-in-vue-router-for-all-the-locales-except-for-th/58244546#58244546","title":"How to add an i18n locale prefix in Vue router for all the locales except for the default one?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7546,"user_id":1209328,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a2c90ac4cf8b9929450fb43655b14a48?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pierre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1209328/pierre"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58244546,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570261187,"creation_date":1570206584,"question_id":58240149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240149","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a route to add a locale prefix for all the routes, I got it working using this code:\r\n\r\n``` lang-js\r\nroutes: [{\r\n  path: &#39;/:lang&#39;,\r\n  component: {\r\n    template: &#39;&lt;router-view /&gt;&#39;\r\n  },\r\n  children: [\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;home&#39;,\r\n      component: Home\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;about&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;about&#39;,\r\n      component: About\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      path: &#39;contact&#39;,\r\n      name: &#39;contact&#39;,\r\n      component: Contact\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the default locale `en` I don&#39;t want to set this prefix so `params.lang` is going to be the full path in this case and not the locale code, so requesting any path without a locale code will render the `Home` component which matches.\r\n\r\nSo how can I do this?

Does anyone have suggestions or ideas as to why we&#39;re seeing such a slow down when going from 3 to 1 cloud spanner instances?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to be clear, we&#39;re using batch insert and when we &quot;reduced&quot; from 3 instances to 1, we blew away the instances and started over with 1.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240145/single-cloud-spanner-instance-performing-very-poorly","title":"Single Cloud Spanner Instance Performing Very Poorly"},{"tags":["python","numpy","csv"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11792939,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b8d726d12365077d6237fc2538d27f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"charlotte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11792939/charlotte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570373733,"post_id":58242170,"comment_id":102885541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240144/add-column-at-beginning-of-csv-that-specifies-the-jpg-name-that-the-data-came-f/58242170#comment102885541_58242170"},{"owner":{"reputation":577,"user_id":11498682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f7a5c175d46bd22f3319cce8d2c1bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahndwoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498682/ahndwoo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11792939,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b8d726d12365077d6237fc2538d27f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"charlotte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11792939/charlotte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570460600,"post_id":58242170,"comment_id":102911279,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240144/add-column-at-beginning-of-csv-that-specifies-the-jpg-name-that-the-data-came-f/58242170#comment102911279_58242170"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":577,"user_id":11498682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f7a5c175d46bd22f3319cce8d2c1bdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ahndwoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11498682/ahndwoo"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570217130,"creation_date":1570217130,"answer_id":58242170,"question_id":58240144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58242170","body_markdown":"You shouldn&#39;t need a 2-D array in this case.

I tried with the T class of the code then it works fine.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240140/comparison-method-violates-its-general-contract-error","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Comparison method violates its general contract error"},{"tags":["vuejs2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":540,"user_id":6080017,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156749383090171/picture?type=large","display_name":"Simon Thiel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6080017/simon-thiel"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570207256,"post_id":58240138,"comment_id":102852893,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240138/how-to-make-unknown-array-of-vue-model#comment102852893_58240138"},{"owner":{"reputation":1147,"user_id":2419954,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7Vb6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rosscooper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2419954/rosscooper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570445560,"post_id":58240138,"comment_id":102903356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240138/how-to-make-unknown-array-of-vue-model#comment102903356_58240138"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9681118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1487964651333392/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jubayer Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9681118/jubayer-ahmed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570612410,"post_id":58240138,"comment_id":102964170,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240138/how-to-make-unknown-array-of-vue-model#comment102964170_58240138"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9681118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1487964651333392/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jubayer Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9681118/jubayer-ahmed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9681118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1487964651333392/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jubayer Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9681118/jubayer-ahmed"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570208349,"creation_date":1570206528,"last_edit_date":1570208349,"question_id":58240138,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240138","body_markdown":"i have a object name question.which is coming from database.i have used v-for with my question object for creating input field.and filing the field the with the question. but i have also a answer field below of question field.i want to use v-model on that answer field. as example i have five question there is five answer field.if i have four question i have four answer field. i don&#39;t know for sure how many question field will be there as it is not certain.i want to use v-model with the answer field.as example if there is five answer field i want to create five object of answer filed. how should i do it?\r\n\r\n        &lt;template&gt;\r\n        &lt;div v-for=&quot;(creative_s,index) in question_s_s.creative_s_s&quot;

Hopefully this will be clear enough.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is to re-work the `pass_3` path so that it returns true when it&#39;s not Wednesday.\r\n\r\nOne way to do that is to add a dummy script task that doesn&#39;t do anything between `pass_3` and `pass_final`.   So you will have completion constraints going from `pass_3` to `dummy_task` and also from `dummy_task` to `pass_final`.\r\n\r\nTHEN you add a constraint from `pass_1` straight to `dummy_task` that checks to see if the day is NOT Wednesday.  And use an OR condition on the constraints going to `dummy_task` so that only one of them has to be true.\r\n\r\nWhat this does is, on Wednesday, `pass_3` will be used, and when completed, it will activate `dummy_task` which will pass through to `pass_final`, and every other day, `pass_3` will be skipped, but `dummy_task` will still get activated and pass through to `pass_final`.\r\n\r\nhope this is clear enough.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240134/ssis-constraints/58272713#58272713","title":"SSIS Constraints"}],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":1566280,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd4daa3ad002744ec83c42058dfdf982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Al__H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566280/al-h"},"last_editor":{"reputation":79,"user_id":1566280,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd4daa3ad002744ec83c42058dfdf982?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Al__H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566280/al-h"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58272713,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570462188,"creation_date":1570206514,"last_edit_date":1570460839,"question_id":58240134,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240134","body_markdown":"We have containers(steps) which only run on Wednesdays.

The way it is currently, if Pass_3 doesn&#39;t run, Pass_Final will not run.\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\nVisual Studio 2015/SSDT 2015","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240134/ssis-constraints","title":"SSIS Constraints"},{"tags":["react-native"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9341891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/902946583200442/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kiet Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9341891/kiet-nguyen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570250314,"post_id":58240538,"comment_id":102862593,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240133/how-can-i-click-components-behind-modal-when-modal-is-opening-in-react-native/58240538#comment102862593_58240538"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12165091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/948e2c7331a2b25f76493329d7d0f686?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12165091/tip"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9341891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/902946583200442/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kiet Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9341891/kiet-nguyen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570295157,"post_id":58240538,"comment_id":102871403,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240133/how-can-i-click-components-behind-modal-when-modal-is-opening-in-react-native/58240538#comment102871403_58240538"},{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9341891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/902946583200442/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kiet Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9341891/kiet-nguyen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570325452,"post_id":58240538,"comment_id":102877072,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240133/how-can-i-click-components-behind-modal-when-modal-is-opening-in-react-native/58240538#comment102877072_58240538"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12165091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/948e2c7331a2b25f76493329d7d0f686?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12165091/tip"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570208575,"creation_date":1570208575,"answer_id":58240538,"question_id":58240133,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58240538","body_markdown":"The modal component use the native Modal, you won&#39;t be able to interact with elements outside it while it is still visible.\r\nI am not sure to understand why you cannot use View to display the results, but maybe you could try with FlatList ?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58240133/how-can-i-click-components-behind-modal-when-modal-is-opening-in-react-native/58240538#58240538","title":"How can i click components behind modal when modal is opening in react native"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9341891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/902946583200442/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kiet Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9341891/kiet-nguyen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9341891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/902946583200442/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kiet Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9341891/kiet-nguyen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570250182,"creation_date":1570206514,"last_edit_date":1570250182,"question_id":58240133,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58240133","body_markdown":"I want to do this layout: [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently I do the layout by this way:\r\n\r\n - menu is belong to the below part and i marginTop: -30 for it to above the image\r\n - FlatList is absolute view and have zIndex bigger than Menu.

I have tried increase the height of the Flatlist and now I can see the filtered list fully but I cannot click the menu button because menu is overived by the Flatlist,\r\n**Second way** \r\n - I use Modal and tried with this library: react-native-modal-dropdown, I can reach my expertation UI but because it use Modal so when Modal is appearing, my textInput in Item is loss focus, so that I cannot continually input to TextInput until I close the Modal. \r\nDo you guys have any solution for it?

You&#39;ll see that in the data I have created, I&#39;ve joined two data frames together (`NameCity` and `CityState`) by using the `inner_join()` function.

\r\n\r\n* **`Write-Host` is meant for _to-display_ output**, not for outputting _data_ - it _bypasses_ PowerShell&#39;s success output stream (PowerShell&#39;s stdout equivalent), so that output from `Write-Host` cannot (directly&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;) be captured in a variable, nor redirected to file - see the bottom half of [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50416448/45375) for more information.\r\n\r\n* Use **`Write-Output`** or - preferably - **PowerShell&#39;s _implicit_ output** behavior to **output _data_**, suitable **for further _programmatic_ processing**.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this fundamental difference, **`Write-Host` and `Write-Output` also differ in how they handle *arguments***:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# What Write-Host prints to the display is a *single string* that is \r\n# the space-separated list of the (stringification of) its arguments.\r\nPS&gt; Write-Host file1, &#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;, file2\r\nfile1 &gt;&gt; file2  # printed to *display* only\r\n\r\n# Write-Output outputs each argument - whatever its data type - *separately*\r\n# to the success output stream.\r\n# In the case of *string* arguments, each string renders *on its own line*.\r\nPS&gt; Write-Output file1, &#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;, file2\r\nfile1\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\nfile2\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing _implicit_ output, the equivalent of the above `Write-Output` command is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Send an array of 3 strings to the success stream.\r\nPS&gt; &#39;file1&#39;, &#39;&gt;&gt;&#39;, &#39;file2&#39;\r\nfile1\r\n&gt;&gt;\r\nfile2\r\n``` \r\n\r\nIf you redirect the `Write-Output` command or its implicit equivalent to a _file_ (with `&gt;` / `Out-File` or `Set-Content`&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;), you&#39;ll get the same 3-line representation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**If you do want to output a *single line* as *data***, use a _quoted string_; to reference _variables_ and embed _subexpressions_ in a string, use an _expandable string_ (string interpolation), `&quot;...`&quot; (see [about_Quoting_Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_quoting_rules)), or use _string concatenation_ (`+`)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$arg1 = &#39;file1&#39;; $arg2 = &#39;file2&#39;\r\n\r\n# Expandable string\r\nPS&gt; &quot;$arg1 &gt;&gt; $arg2&quot;\r\nfile1 &gt;&gt; file2\r\n\r\n# String concatenation\r\nPS&gt; $arg1 + &#39; &gt;&gt; &#39; + $arg2\r\nfile1 &gt;&gt; file2\r\n```\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;[1] In PowerShell v5 or higher, you _can_ capture/redirect `Write-Host` output, via the _information output stream_, number `6`; e.g.: `$writeHostOutput = &amp; { Write-Host hi } 6&gt;&amp;1`. However, note that the information output stream is primarily designed to work with the PSv5+ `Write-Information` cmdlet and the common `-InformationAction` parameter.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;[2] With _strings only_, `&gt;` / `Out-File` behave the same as `Set-Content`, except that in _Windows PowerShell_ a different default character applies (not in PowerShell _Core_).
