language-all: lang-cmd --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe option `skip=0` is not accepted by the [`for /F` command][cmdfor], the specified number must be in the range from 1 to 2&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus;&#160;1. To skip no lines just do not provide the `skip` option at all.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYou seem to try to assign the text of a certain line to a variable (for instance, the third one):\r\n\r\n    FOR /F &quot;skip=2 delims=&quot; %%i IN (values.txt) DO SET @valuethreefinal=%%i\r\n\r\nWell, this actually assigns the content of the last line to the variable, because the `set` command in the body of the loop is executed for all but the skipped lines. More precisely said, the `for /F` loop iterates over all non-empty lines which do not begin with `;` which is the default character of the `eol` option.\r\n\r\nTo actually assign the third line to the variable you need to change the code:\r\n\r\n    rem // Ensure that the variable is initially unset somewhere before:\r\n    set &quot;@valuethreefinal=&quot;\r\n    rem // As soon as the variable is set the `if` condition is no longer going to be fulfilled:\r\n    for /F &quot;usebackq skip=2 delims=&quot; %%i in (&quot;values.txt&quot;) do if not defined @valuethreefinal set &quot;@valuethreefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n\r\nThis does not necessarily assign the third line to the variable, it actually assigns the text of the first line after the (two) skipped ones that is not empty and does not begin with `;` (remember the `eol` character).\r\n\r\nThe `usebackq` option allows to put quotation marks around the file name. This is not necessary in your situation, but it is when a file name contains &lt;kbd&gt;SPACEs&lt;/kbd&gt; or other special characters.\r\n\r\nI used the undocumented quoted `set` syntax here because this is safer than the unquoted one, particularly when it comes to special characters and also to avoid unintended trailing white-spaces.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTo disable the `eol` character you could use the undocumented unquoted option string syntax:\r\n\r\n    for /F usebackq^ skip^=2^ delims^=^ eol^= %%i in (&quot;values.txt&quot;) do if not defined @valuethreefinal set &quot;@valuethreefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n\r\nAs you can see the &lt;kbd&gt;SPACEs&lt;/kbd&gt; and `=`-signs are [escaped][synesc] by the caret symbol `^` in order to treat the whole option string as a unit.\r\n\r\nThis still skips over empty lines though. To prevent this take a loop at this thread: [preserve empty lines in a text file while using batch for /f][relthr].\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSince you want to capture more than a single line you could extend the code to the following:\r\n\r\n    set &quot;@valueonefinal=&quot; &amp; set &quot;@valuethreefinal=&quot; &amp; set &quot;@valuethreefinal=&quot;\r\n    for /F usebackq^ delims^=^ eol^= %%i in (&quot;values.txt&quot;) do (\r\n        if not defined @valueonefinal (\r\n            set &quot;@valueonefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n        ) else (\r\n            if not defined @valuetwofinal (\r\n                set &quot;@valuetwofinal=%%i&quot;\r\n            ) else (\r\n                if not defined @valuethreefinal (\r\n                    set &quot;@valuethreefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n                )\r\n            )\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThis can be compressed to:\r\n\r\n    set &quot;@valueonefinal=&quot; &amp; set &quot;@valuethreefinal=&quot; &amp; set &quot;@valuethreefinal=&quot;\r\n    for /F usebackq^ delims^=^ eol^= %%i in (&quot;values.txt&quot;) do (\r\n        if not defined @valueonefinal (\r\n            set &quot;@valueonefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n        ) else if not defined @valuetwofinal (\r\n            set &quot;@valuetwofinal=%%i&quot;\r\n        ) else if not defined @valuethreefinal (\r\n            set &quot;@valuethreefinal=%%i&quot;\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nA more flexible method is to use [pseudo-arrays][relans]:\r\n\r\n    rem // Initialise an index counter:\r\n    set /A &quot;INDEX=0&quot;\r\n    rem // Assign every line to an element of a pseudo-array:\r\n    for /F usebackq^ delims^=^ eol^= %%i in (&quot;values.txt&quot;) do (\r\n        rem // Increment the index counter:\r\n        set /A &quot;INDEX+=1&quot;\r\n        rem // Assign the current line to a pseudo-array element:\r\n        call set &quot;@valuefinal[%%INDEX%%]=%%i&quot;\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThe (non-empty) lines of the file `value.txt` are now assigned to variables called `@valuefinal[1]`, `@valuefinal[2]`, `@valuefinal[3]`, etc. (there is no concept of arrays in batch scripting, the variables are exactly the same as yours, `@valueonefinal`, etc., that is why I use the term &quot;pseudo&quot;).\r\n\r\nThe [`call` command][cmdcal] is used here in order to be able to write and read the variable `INDEX` within the same block of code; just using `set &quot;@valuefinal[%INDEX%]=%%i&quot;` would result in assigning and therefore overwriting the variable `@valuefinal[0]` in every loop iteration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [relthr]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/38723595\r\n            (preserve empty lines in a text file while using batch for /f)\r\n  [relans]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/10167990\r\n            (Arrays, linked lists and other data structures in cmd.exe (batch) script)\r\n  [cmdfor]: https://ss64.com/nt/for_f.html\r\n            (FOR /F)\r\n  [cmdset]: https://ss64.com/nt/set.html\r\n            (SET)\r\n  [cmdcal]: https://ss64.com/nt/call.html\r\n            (CALL)\r\n  [synesc]: https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-esc.html\r\n            (Syntax : Escape Characters, Delimiters and Quotes)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994853/batch-for-cmd-works-partially-skip-option-not-working/58001630#58001630","title":"Batch: &#39;FOR&#39; cmd works partially, &#39;skip=&#39; option not working"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1582,"user_id":3985011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1706647339/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ben Personick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3985011/ben-personick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1582,"user_id":3985011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1706647339/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ben Personick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3985011/ben-personick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571332640,"last_edit_date":1571332640,"creation_date":1568850530,"answer_id":58002006,"question_id":57994853,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58002006","body_markdown":"&lt;!-- language-all: lang-cmd --&gt;\r\n\r\nYour problem is that you are parsing the File from Top to bottom, and skipping the First value, what you don&#39;t realize is that FOR will set the value to the LAST item it found.

is being defined in the css here:\r\n\r\n    header,main,nav,article,aside,footer {\r\n      background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);\r\n      padding: 0.5em;\r\n      margin-bottom: 0.5em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor example with the structure with the nav being encolsed in the header:\r\n\r\n    &lt;header&gt;\r\n    &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\r\n        Logo – Beschreibung\r\n    &lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;nav&gt;\r\n      Navigation\r\n    &lt;/nav&gt;\r\n    &lt;/header&gt;\r\n\r\nYour header and your nav are inheriting from the same css class which background color has an opacity setting: background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, **0.2**);\r\n\r\nHtml elements do not get laid inset, they are stacked on top of each other. \r\n\r\nAs the items are stacked and inherit, it gives the item darker shades as opacity as they stacked on each other.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t think of the elements on the page as some flat structure. An abstract example would be to think would be:\r\n\r\nSay you have a piece of paper on a desk with some writing on it. You also have two pieces of glass that are tinted yellow, one slightly smaller than the other. Put one piece of yellow glass down over the paper and it turns from white to slightly yellow.  Put the slightly smaller piece of glass on top of that glass. Now, where ever there is two panes of glass, it is even darker yellow. \r\n\r\nThat is essentially what you are doing with css here.\r\n\r\nThe body element is the paper which is defined as green: background-color: green;\r\n\r\nThe header is the next layer you are placing down and it is semi transparent (because you are telling it to have opacity with the last param in the rgba background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);)  so you get a tinted color wherever the header overlays on top of the body.\r\n\r\nNow you have another element you are placing inside the header. It has its own margins so it doesn&#39;t cover up the entire header completely. So you place the nav item inside the header. Per css it also has a background color with opacity background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) so it will cause that area to be even darker.

I&#39;m checking for the expedite intent as an interrupt and pushing the dialog on the stack.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the dialog, I&#39;m prompting the user if they want to return to the previous conversation. If Yes, I call endDialog which pops the dialog off the stack and returns to the previous dialog. This is working. If No, I call cancelAllDialogs. I expect this to clear the dialog stack, but it appears to be cancelling only the current (expedite) dialog and it&#39;s still returning to the previous viewOrder dialog.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to figure out how to clear the dialog stack if the user says at the end of the expedite dialog that they do not want to continue.\r\n\r\nAt first I tried having the dialog return a continueDialog boolean value and cancelling from the interrupt function. But await only waits on beginning the dialog, not the result, so the interrupt function completes before the user goes through the expedite dialog.\r\n\r\nI changed to just push the new dialog on to the stack and handle cancelling from the expedite function, but cancelAllDialogs doesn&#39;t appear to cancel clear the stack from within this separate dialog.\r\n\r\n```nodejs\r\nasync continueAction(step) {\r\n     if (step.result) {\r\n          return await step.endDialog();\r\n     } else {\r\n          await step.context.sendActivity(`OK, please let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.`);\r\n          return await step.cancelAllDialogs();\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that &quot;step&quot; is just the name of my dialog context, you may have this as &quot;context&quot;, &quot;stepContext&quot;, &quot;dc&quot;, &quot;innerDc&quot;, etc.\r\n\r\nstep.result.value is the result of the ConfirmPrompt, and I am correctly arriving in the else block when selecting &#39;No&#39;.

You also pay for both [storage and compute](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/postgresql/server/) on an on-going basis.  The storage costs for the same amount of data are going to be more expensive in a managed DBMS vs a [blob store](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/).  \r\n\r\nIt is also harder to scale out processing on a DBMS (it appears the largest size Postgres server Azure offers has 64 vcpus).  By storing data into an RDBMs you are likely going to run-up against IO or compute bottlenecks more quickly then you would with Spark + blob storage.  However, for many datasets this might not be an issue and as the tweet points out if you can accomplish everything inside a the DB with SQL then it is a much simpler architecture.\r\n\r\nIf you store Parquet files on a blob-store, updating existing data is difficult without regenerating a large segment of your data (and I don&#39;t know the details of Azure but generally can&#39;t be done transactionally).

Parquet is a Row Columnar file format well suited for querying large amounts of data in quick time. As you said above, writing data to Parquet from Spark is pretty easy. Also writing data using a distributed processing engine (Spark) to a distributed file system (Parquet+HDFS) makes the entire flow seamless. This architecture is well suited for OLAP type data.\r\n\r\nPostgres on the other hand is a relational database. While it is good for storing and analyzing transactional data, it cannot be scaled horizontally as easily as HDFS can be. Hence when writing/querying large amount of data from Spark to/on Postgres, the database can become a bottleneck. But if the data you are processing is OLTP type, then you can consider this architecture.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994758/why-parquet-over-some-rdbms-like-postgres/58009791#58009791","title":"Why Parquet over some RDBMS like Postgres"}],"owner":{"reputation":1156,"user_id":3723311,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VbRLd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ragnar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3723311/ragnar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58006309,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568891817,"creation_date":1568815792,"last_edit_date":1568877951,"question_id":57994758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57994758","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working to build a data architecture for my company.

OS level**\r\n\r\n - use OS and filesystem suitable for storing that many files in a single directory\r\n\r\n**2. Application level**\r\n\r\n - use key diversification instead of key generation (if possible for your use case) -- i.e. if you need to provide keys for thousands of entities use a master key and diversify all keys for your entities using this master key and some diversification data (e.g. entity identity / serial number / etc.). This way you don&#39;t need to store thousands of keys as you simply diversify them on-demand. Remember to carefully analyze if you can use key diversification at all (as there are some consequences)\r\n\r\n - store those keys encrypted outside the security world (if possible for your use case) -- i.e. import/generate each key as temporal object and immediately wrap it using some persistent wrapping key (you could call this key LMK). Safely store the wrapped value in RDBMS (or anywhere else) and delete the temporal object. Later when you need to access this particular key you simply unwrap it back into temporal object and use it. Again this approach has some consequences and you must analyze thoroughly if it can be used in your situation\r\n\r\nGood luck with your project!\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: I am no crypto expert so please do validate my thoughts.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994744/saving-thales-keys-to-different-location-than-kmdata-local/58088203#58088203","title":"Saving Thales keys to different location than KMDATA/local"}],"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":1379371,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/efb498e58cb0d09d7cc6dd3f2f7df93c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ferjani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1379371/ferjani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569359536,"creation_date":1568815754,"question_id":57994744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57994744","body_markdown":"I&#39;m generating cryptographic keys using Thales HSMs. The encrypted keys are stored to /opt/nfast/kmdata/local.

The given thread state must be\r\n&gt; the current thread state. See the discussion of thread states below. When the call returns, the\r\n&gt; current thread state is NULL. All thread states associated with this interpreter are destroyed. (**The\r\n&gt; global interpreter lock must be held** before calling this function and is **still held when it returns.**)\r\n&gt; Py_FinalizeEx() will destroy all sub-interpreters that haven’t been explicitly destroyed at that point.\r\n\r\nGreat! So we call `PyEval_RestoreThread` to restore our thread state to the thread we&#39;re about to terminate, and then call `Py_EndInterpreter`.\r\n\r\n    // Acquire the GIL\r\n    PyEval_RestoreThread(thread);\r\n\r\n    // Tear down the interpreter.\r\n    Py_EndInterpreter(thread);\r\n\r\n    // Now what? We still hold the GIL and we no longer have a valid thread state.\r\n    // Previously we did PyEval_ReleaseLock here, but that is now deprecated.\r\n\r\nThe documentation for `PyEval_ReleaseLock` says that we should either use `PyEval_SaveThread` or `PyEval_ReleaseThread`.\r\n`PyEval_ReleaseThread`&#39;s documentation says that the input thread state must not be NULL. Okay, but we can&#39;t pass in the recently deleted thread state.\r\n\r\n`PyEval_SaveThread` will hit a debug assertion if you try to call it after calling `Py_EndInterpreter`, so that&#39;s not an option either.\r\n\r\nSo, we&#39;ve currently implemented a hack to get around this issue - we save the thread state of the thread that calls `Py_InitializeEx` in a global variable, and swap to it after calling `Py_EndInterpreter`.\r\n\r\n    // Acquire the GIL\r\n    PyEval_RestoreThread(thread);\r\n\r\n    // Tear down the interpreter.\r\n    Py_EndInterpreter(thread);\r\n\r\n    // Swap to the main thread state.\r\n    PyThreadState_Swap(g_init.thread_state_);\r\n    PyEval_SaveThread(); // Release the GIL. Probably.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the proper solution here? It seems that embedded Python is an afterthought for this API.\r\n\r\nSimilar question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15470367\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Is it possible to do a select on the table that grabs the rows and instead of returning 2 rows because of the result_id, it groups those ones that have dupes into a single row with the result_id being a concatenated string? So for instance, return this:\r\n\r\n    Group_Key      Trigger_Type        Event_Type         Result_Id\r\n    1                   A                   A                 1\r\n    2                   B                   B                 2\r\n    3                   C                   C                 3,4 \r\n    4                   E                   E                 5\r\n    5                   F                   F                 6,7\r\n\r\nIs this possible?\r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994721/sql-select-is-it-possible-to-merge-specific-dupe-rows-into-1-based-on-a-key","title":"SQL Select, is it possible to merge specific dupe rows into 1 based on a key?"},{"tags":["c#","authentication","asp.net-core","cookies","session-cookies"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1401,"user_id":1111823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":28,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfJyw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Timur Lemeshko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1111823/timur-lemeshko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568822003,"post_id":57996085,"comment_id":102399790,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994719/asp-net-core-session-authentication/57996085#comment102399790_57996085"},{"owner":{"reputation":7879,"user_id":3667938,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60005b5f4fa0a22e7e1cfbc9032da272?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kahbazi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3667938/kahbazi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1401,"user_id":1111823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":28,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfJyw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Timur Lemeshko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1111823/timur-lemeshko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568822675,"post_id":57996085,"comment_id":102400137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994719/asp-net-core-session-authentication/57996085#comment102400137_57996085"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7879,"user_id":3667938,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/60005b5f4fa0a22e7e1cfbc9032da272?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kahbazi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3667938/kahbazi"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568819893,"creation_date":1568819893,"answer_id":57996085,"question_id":57994719,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57996085","body_markdown":"You need to set [SessionStore][1] for identity cookie authentication, so your authentication cookie is only an identifier.\r\n\r\nInstead of \r\n\r\n    services.AddDefaultIdentity&lt;IdentityUser&gt;()\r\n\r\n\r\nUse this\r\n\r\n    services.AddAuthentication(o =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        o.DefaultScheme = IdentityConstants.ApplicationScheme;\r\n        o.DefaultSignInScheme = IdentityConstants.ExternalScheme;\r\n    }).AddIdentityCookies(o =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        o.ApplicationCookie.PostConfigure(cookie =&gt;

I would like complement your anwser.\r\n\r\nTo resolve the problem, I made folow:\r\n\r\n+ Uninstall all SQLServer instances and tools. You don&#39;t need remove SQL Management Studio only all features from the SQL Server.\r\n+ Uninstall MV C++ 2017\r\n+ Install MV C++ 2015\r\n+ Install SQL Server Developer. During instalation select Integration Service in features selections.\r\n\r\n&gt; Don&#39;t forget reboot the operational system after uninstall process.\r\n\r\n&gt; The SQL Server 2017 Setup result error whether you have the Microsoft Visual C++ 2017 installed in your Operational System. \r\n\r\n&gt; The SQL 2017 needs of the MV C++ 2015. Because this you need remove the latest versions. \r\n\r\nTo check Integration Service status your need:\r\n\r\n* Open Services Manager of the Operational System and find name SQL Server Integration Services. The status from the service has be started.\r\n\r\nTo download from SQL Server use microsoft site [https://www.microsoft.com/pt-br/sql-server/sql-server-downloads]\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t use SQL Server Express use Developer Edition.

Secondly, you may have to update the query for this rule as per the documentation\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\nuse Illuminate\\Validation\\Rule;\r\n\r\nValidator::make($data, [\r\n    &#39;email&#39; =&gt; [\r\n        &#39;required&#39;,\r\n        Rule::exists(&#39;staff&#39;)-&gt;where(function ($query) {\r\n            $query-&gt;where(&#39;account_id&#39;, 1);\r\n        }),\r\n    ],\r\n]);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere you can pass additional query parameters.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994714/laravel-unique-validation-with-different-fields/57995009#57995009","title":"Laravel : Unique validation with different fields"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":9033690,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f767e42b4cf4fb6a328c2eb3912c3c8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Javed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9033690/javed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568817544,"post_id":57995158,"comment_id":102397132,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994714/laravel-unique-validation-with-different-fields/57995158#comment102397132_57995158"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5276,"user_id":7437058,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PX29G.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Leorent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7437058/leorent"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568816906,"creation_date":1568816906,"answer_id":57995158,"question_id":57994714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57995158","body_markdown":"You do not need a custom validation for that one, laravel has a unique column validation \r\n\r\n```\r\n$this-&gt;validate($request, [\r\n    &#39;country_id&#39;

To achieve this, we should make sure that the wrapped component complies to following:\r\n\r\n1. accepts `onClick` prop and correctly handles it (in my case, actually accepts HTMLAttributes&lt;NodeType&gt;, i.e. the component is either `emotion`&#39;s StyledComponent or a component with custom styles that forwards all props to an intrinsic JSX element)\r\n2. forwards ref object to underlying intrinsic JSX element.\r\n\r\nThis is my current implementation:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype NodeType&lt;Props&gt; = Props extends HTMLAttributes&lt;infer _NodeType&gt; &amp; ClassAttributes&lt;infer _NodeType&gt;\r\n  ? _NodeType\r\n  : never\r\n\r\nexport const withAutoBlur = &lt;Props extends HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLElement&gt;&gt;\r\n  (Component: FC&lt;Props &amp; ClassAttributes&lt;NodeType&lt;Props&gt;&gt;&gt;) =&gt; {\r\n  const WrappedWithAutoBlur: React.FC&lt;Props&gt; = (props: Props) =&gt; {\r\n    type HTMLNode = NodeType&lt;Props&gt;\r\n\r\n    const { onClick } = props\r\n\r\n    const ref = useRef&lt;HTMLNode&gt;(null)\r\n    const clickHandler = useCallback((e: React.MouseEvent&lt;HTMLNode&gt;) =&gt; {\r\n      ref.current &amp;&amp; ref.current.blur()\r\n\r\n      onClick &amp;&amp; onClick(e)\r\n    }, [onClick])\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;Component {...props} ref={ref} onClick={clickHandler} /&gt;\r\n    )\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return WrappedWithAutoBlur\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis implementation silences all type warnings, so it *kind of* works. There are two issues though:\r\n\r\n1. component that accepts no props, that is, has props type of empty object (`{}`), passes the generic type constraint `extends HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLElement&gt;` since all properties of `HTMLAttributes&lt;HTMLElement&gt;` are optional\r\n2. if you pass a functional component into this HOC that actually doesn&#39;t forward ref, TS thinks it&#39;s perfectly fine. React doesn&#39;t think the same, though.\r\n\r\n```\r\nWarning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994706/how-to-type-a-hoc-which-accepts-a-component-that-should-expose-ref-prop-and-care","title":"How to type a HOC which accepts a component that should expose ref prop and care about HTMLAttributes?"},{"tags":["text","copy","paste"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12037193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCImQ4wwIJkCyiTlQ7ujysKREXJgHcVbPfbTcTh=k-s128","display_name":"Aiman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12037193/aiman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568815636,"creation_date":1568815636,"question_id":57994705,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57994705","body_markdown":"I have a pdf Arabic file when I copy from it and paste in office word.

I do not need the full solution to the problem but I seem to do something wrong as my program takes forever to finish.\r\n\r\nThe task is formulated as follows:\r\n\r\n&gt; A family wants to travel by bus. Their gas however won&#39;t be enough for the whole route. One of the kids says that it wants to stop only when necessary as to arrive faster. The other kid suggest to save some money by visiting the cheapest gas stations. \r\n\r\n&gt;They finally agree on visiting as few gas stations as possible BUT if there are multiple options they want to have the cheapest one. Below is one of the text files. It&#39;s contents are: **Liter per Kilometer, max Liter, current Liter, km from start to destination, total amount of possible gas stations and the gas stations**.

requirement is to produce one single flat file from three different datasets that should have timestamp value in the name of the file. All three datasets are from SQL server and using SQL query to take these data from source. Source type is OLEDB Source.  \r\n\r\n**DataSet 1**: This is a header dataset with just one single row which has different columns. First two columns are hardcoded and timestamp calculated dynamically. \r\n\r\n    +--------+----------+----------------------+--------------------+\r\n    | FileID | FileType | SourceBeginTimestamp | SourceEndTimestamp |\r\n    +--------+---------------------------------+--------------------+\r\n    |    1   |    TXT   |   Time SSIS starts   |   Time SSIS Ends   |\r\n\r\n**DataSet 2**: Dataset that contains several columns with data. Total rows are typically 1000 to 10000. \r\n\r\n    +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n    | Column1 | Column2 | Column3 | Column4 | Column5 |\r\n    +---------+---------+---------+---------+---------+\r\n    |         |         |         |         |         |\r\n\r\n\r\n**DataSet 3**: Footer dataset contains the total number of rows including **Dataset1**, **Dataset2** and **dataset3**. Below example -considering Dataset2 has **1198** rows. \r\n\r\n    +-----------+----------+\r\n    | TotalRows | FileType |\r\n    +-----------+----------+\r\n    |    1200   |    txt   |\r\n\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;ve done So Far:** I used three different Dataflow tasks and flat file connection managers for each dataset. Using an expression to dynamically create the flat file names with timestamp without Seconds in it. This way, when i run the package, it&#39;ll create only one file and dump all three datasets into one single file. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, when the package runs in middle of a minute change, then there will be two files. \r\n\r\n**Expected Result:** I want to combine these three flat files into one single flatfile with file name like SampleText_YYYYMMDDHHMISS.txt. I&#39;m trying a way to use the File System Task or have the DFT to dump the data into rowset and then use script task to dump all the data into one flat file. \r\n\r\nThe output file will not have the headernames (ColumnNames)\r\n\r\nPlease suggest the best way to do it.

There&#39;s two parts to this - PL/SQL on the server side, and javascript on the client side.\r\n\r\nOn the server side, the easiest way is to set up an On-Demand Process that returns your JSON. It sounds like your block above works fine for that. \r\n\r\nOn the client side, you can either use the [Application Express JavaScript API][1] or jQuery (the APEX JS stuff is just a convenience wrapper around jQuery).\r\n\r\nExample client-side AJAX call:\r\n\r\n\tapex.server.process ( &quot;MY_PROCESS&quot;, {\r\n\t  x01: &quot;test&quot;,\r\n\t  pageItems: &quot;#P1_DEPTNO,#P1_EMPNO&quot;\r\n\t  }, {\r\n\t success: function( pData ) { ... do something here ... }\r\n\t  } );\r\n\r\nIn this example, `pData` is the JSON returned from your On-Demand Process - whatever you want to do with it, you should do in the success callback function. \r\n\r\nThree parameters are being sent to the On-Demand Process named `MY_PROCESS`: `x01`, which can be accessed in PL/SQL as `apex_application.g_x01` or [`:APP_AJAX_X01`][2], and two page items, which are added to session state and can be accessed the usual way (`:P1_DEPTNO`, etc).\r\n\r\nSee also this article on [how to test an On-Demand Process][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/AEAPI/javascript_api.htm#AEAPI29529\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E59726_01/doc.50/e39147/concept_sub.htm#HTMDB30285\r\n  [3]: http://www.inside-oracle-apex.com/how-to-test-an-on-demand-process-used-for-ajax/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994683/return-json-into-javascript-object-from-oracle-apex/57995342#57995342","title":"Return JSON into javascript object from Oracle APEX"}],"owner":{"reputation":1327,"user_id":1754307,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7170dd9a6ce7317ab73835c15ef1d9f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smackenzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1754307/smackenzie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1327,"user_id":1754307,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7170dd9a6ce7317ab73835c15ef1d9f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smackenzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1754307/smackenzie"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57995342,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568817424,"creation_date":1568815589,"last_edit_date":1568815933,"question_id":57994683,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57994683","body_markdown":" \r\nIs there a way to populate a client side javascript object, for use in visualisation libraries like D3 or Paper.JS via ORACLE APEX, without the ORDS REST service?\r\n \r\ni.e. can I use the javascript API, or PL/SQL (APEX_JSON?) for example to run a query, and return into a client side javascript object the json response?\r\n \r\nI know how to return JSON into a PL/SQL Dynamic Content region for example using PL/SQL (see below), but if I just want the data to get returned into a client side javascript object - whats the process?

These plain SQL scripts contain multiple SQL statements, which are executed by our PHP framework, like this:\r\n\r\n    $conn = PDO::conn(&#39;mysql:......&#39;,&#39;user&#39;,&#39;pw&#39;);\r\n    $ret = $conn-&gt;exec(&#39;\r\n        DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_my_view;\r\n        CREATE VIEW v_my_view AS SELECT id,name FROM mytable;\r\n    &#39;);\r\n    // $ret now contains 1\r\n    if ($ret === FALSE) { // some error handling }\r\n\r\nThis works fine, even for many statements within one exec() call: The database executes all statements.\r\n\r\nNow if the SQL itself contains an error, (e.g. syntax error, or unknown column etc.), the call to exec() returns exactly the same as before (1), and also DBH::errorInfo() returns no error:\r\n\r\n    $conn = PDO::conn(&#39;mysql:......&#39;,&#39;user&#39;,&#39;pw&#39;);\r\n    $ret = $conn-&gt;exec(&#39;\r\n        DROP VIEW IF EXISTS v_my_view;\r\n        -- The following statement creates an SQL error (unknown column):\r\n        CREATE VIEW v_my_view AS SELECT id,name_not_known FROM mytable;\r\n    &#39;);\r\n    // $ret still contains 1\r\n    var_dump($conn-&gt;errorInfo()); // Returns Error Code 0, all fine.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that PDO::exec() does support multiple statements, but does not implement any error handling / abort mechanism.\r\nThis also seems to be a MySQL-only problem: The same mechanism works fine on a PostgreSQL database.\r\n\r\nIs there any way we can force PDO to &quot;stop on errors&quot; on multiple statement queries?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994664/how-to-get-sql-errors-when-using-multiple-statements","title":"How to get SQL errors when using multiple statements"},{"tags":["php","wordpress","categories","custom-wordpress-pages"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":11460305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2951032741592059/picture?type=large","display_name":"Stelios Botonakis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11460305/stelios-botonakis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568820676,"creation_date":1568820676,"answer_id":57996309,"question_id":57994659,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57996309","body_markdown":"Thanks to another post I figured it out.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/a/7738746/11460305\r\n\r\n```\r\n$currentCategory = single_cat_title(&quot;&quot;, false);\r\n$paged = (get_query_var( &#39;paged&#39; )) ? get_query_var( &#39;paged&#39; ) : 1;\r\n        $args = array(\r\n            &#39;post_type&#39; =&gt; &#39;page&#39;,\r\n            &#39;post_status&#39; =&gt; &#39;publish&#39;,\r\n            &#39;meta_key&#39; =&gt; &#39;_wp_page_template&#39;,\r\n            &#39;meta_value&#39; =&gt; &#39;post.php&#39;,\r\n            &#39;category_name&#39; =&gt; $currentCategory,\r\n            &#39;posts_per_page&#39; =&gt; 12,\r\n            &#39;paged&#39; =&gt; $paged,\r\n        );\r\n        $arr_posts = new WP_Query( $args );\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57994659/how-to-display-in-a-category-page-all-pages-that-are-of-that-parent-category-but/57996309#57996309","title":"How to display in a category page all pages that are of that parent category but also of its subcategories"}],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":11460305,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2951032741592059/picture?type=large","display_name":"Stelios Botonakis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11460305/stelios-botonakis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568820676,"creation_date":1568815527,"question_id":57994659,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57994659","body_markdown":"I have created some categories for my Wordpress pages, some of which have subcategories and some of those have subcategories of their own.
