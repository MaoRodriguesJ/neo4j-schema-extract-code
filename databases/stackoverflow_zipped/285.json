I will also be transparent by saying that I am working on coming up with a solution to create multiple lineups for MLB DFS. I have put together my own player valuation, which I call bVal. I&#39;m not trying to win a lot of money. It&#39;s something I put together that a friend of mine from college and I use to play MLB DFS for fun (the goal is to pretty much break even). Really it&#39;s a way for us to stay connected even though we no longer live in the same city. So with that on the table, I&#39;ve been doing some limited research (when I have time outside of work and family) to put together a solution to create multiple lineups. What I&#39;ve read so far is that I need to use the multiple knapsack and perhaps combine it linear optimization. Again, these are beyond my area of expertise (I was a Java developer at one point in my career). So basically, where I am at is I am trying to use the or-tools to come up with a multiple knapsack solution that uses multiple contraints:\r\n\r\nI have a list of baseball players that have a salary, a value (bVal), and a position. I want to put together a lineup which has constraints on the maximum and minimum number of total players in a lineup as well as a maximum and minimum number of players in a lineup at each position. I would also like to add constraints that would allow me to set the maximum and minimum times a player could be in the multiple lineups (to prevent having too many very similar lineups). So for simplistic sake, Let&#39;s say I need to build a lineup with exactly 5 players, which would exist of 1 P, 2 IF, 2 OF. What I don&#39;t get is how to add constraints to the multiple knapsack example provided by or-tools.\r\n\r\nCan someone point me in the right direction of how to add these constraints (using Java as my preferred language)? Or am I on the complete wrong track here?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m assuming I need to add constraints to the model for the number of players (i.e. 5 per lineup), the maximum and minimum number of players for each position type, and the maximum and minimum number of lineups each player can be contained in.\r\n\r\n    // Instantiate the data problem.\r\n    final DataModel data = new DataModel();\r\n    int

Rather, you should make `state` a &quot;bound&quot; field, and allow other code to attach property change listeners to the object so that the GUI object can notify any and all listeners if the state changes. \r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n* Make the state field a *private* instance field of your Frame class.\r\n* Give the class a `public static final String STATE = &quot;state&quot;;` constant\r\n* Create a getter and setter method for state, `public int getState()`, `public void setState(int state)`\r\n* Within the `setState(...)` method create two local int variables oldValue and newValue, and pass the respective state values (the parameter and the `this` value) into these variables.\r\n* Your Frame has property change support. So use it to notify any attached listeners that state has change by calling `firePropertyChange(STATE, oldValue, newValue);`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nMain class that creates both ArrayObject2d and your Frame object (here named Frame2 to avoid confusion with `java.awt.Frame`)\r\n\r\n\timport java.awt.Color;\r\n\timport java.awt.Dimension;\r\n\timport java.awt.GridBagLayout;\r\n\timport java.awt.event.*;\r\n\timport javax.swing.*;\r\n\r\n\tpublic class MainClass {\r\n\t\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\t\tSwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\tfinal Frame2 frame = new Frame2();\r\n\t\t\t\tframe.setVisible(true);\r\n\t\t\t\tfinal ArrayObject2d array = new ArrayObject2d(10, 5);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tframe.addPropertyChangeListener(Frame2.FRAME_STATE, propChngEvent -&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tif (frame.getFrameState() == 1) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.setRandom(100);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.print();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else if (frame.getFrameState() == 2) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.setAll(99999);\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.print();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else if (frame.getFrameState() == 3) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.numberAll();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.print();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t} else if (frame.getFrameState() == 4) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tarray.showIndex();\r\n\t\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t\t});\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nThe Frame2 class is below.

The following code is executed with `Task.Run` but won&#39;t produce any errors while instantiating Unity objects since it&#39;s done in the right thread.\r\n\r\n    private static async Task DoWork(CancellationToken token)\r\n    {\r\n        token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();\r\n\r\n        var gameObjects = new List&lt;GameObject&gt;();\r\n\r\n        await ThreadSwitcher.ResumeUnityAsync();\r\n\r\n        for (var i = 0; i &lt; 25; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            if (token.IsCancellationRequested)\r\n                token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();\r\n\r\n            await Task.Delay(125, token);\r\n\r\n            var gameObject = new GameObject(i.ToString());\r\n\r\n            gameObjects.Add(gameObject);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow it&#39;s up to you to finely slice your work since by nature Unity synchronization context is not meant to run heavy computation, rather, just instantiate stuff you wouldn&#39;t be able to from another thread.\r\n\r\nA simple example would be generating some procedural mesh:\r\n\r\n- do all your maths in your task and produce enough data to create a mesh\r\n  - i.e. vertices, normals, colors, uvs\r\n- switch to Unity thread\r\n  - create a mesh from this data, PERIOD, this will be fast enough to be non-perceptible\r\n\r\nThat was an interesting question, I hope I&#39;ve answered it !\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20190329-00/?p=102373\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469468/what-does-unitymainthreaddispatcher-do/58470597#58470597","title":"What does UnityMainThreadDispatcher do?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12104604,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa987be49c5c93a70a257c81eeb8bb4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"taichi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12104604/taichi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9035,"user_id":361899,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c16354d30a3d1531f8a7fa053b95716c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aybe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/361899/aybe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58470597,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571707703,"creation_date":1571536858,"last_edit_date":1571553648,"question_id":58469468,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469468","body_markdown":"I read this code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/johnjcsmith/iPhoneMoCapUnity/blob/master/Assets/NetworkMeshAnimator.cs\r\n\r\nThere is the following description around the 62nd line of the code. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of processing is this doing?\r\n\r\n\t\tif (UnityMainThreadDispatcher.Exists()) {\r\n\t\t\tdispatcher = UnityMainThreadDispatcher.Instance ();\r\n\t\t} \r\n\r\nThere is code on GitHub, but is it a standard feature in Unity?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469468/what-does-unitymainthreaddispatcher-do","title":"What does UnityMainThreadDispatcher do?"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":943,"user_id":3532564,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0nSv2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Quah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3532564/ian-quah"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571537055,"post_id":58469467,"comment_id":103273022,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469467/dimensions-after-convolution-layer-and-pooling#comment103273022_58469467"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11781314,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP5UyFIdS0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7pWqERj6msGhdfjMung2MRNwvc4AA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EmanuelA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11781314/emanuela"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":943,"user_id":3532564,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0nSv2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Quah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3532564/ian-quah"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571537210,"post_id":58469467,"comment_id":103273030,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469467/dimensions-after-convolution-layer-and-pooling#comment103273030_58469467"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11781314,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZzP5UyFIdS0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7pWqERj6msGhdfjMung2MRNwvc4AA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EmanuelA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11781314/emanuela"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571536856,"creation_date":1571536856,"question_id":58469467,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469467","body_markdown":"I&#39;m testing some things out with the MNIST dataset. images are 28x28 and my x_train has dimensions (60000,28,28,1).

`co_await`-based coroutine mechanism is designed around a very specific usage scenario: you invoke an asynchronous operation and suspend your current function, scheduling its resumption when the asynchronous operation has generated a value. That&#39;s the core use case behind the feature. Even generator-based scenarios are just a degenerate form of this, where there is no asynchronous operation, and the future/promise machinery instead gives the caller the power to resume the coroutine.\r\n\r\nWhat you&#39;re doing here is not incorrect, in the sense that the coroutine machinery permits you to do this kind of repeated execution of some async operation through a single coroutine future. And if you feel that this is the most efficient way to handle the specific task you&#39;re trying to accomplish, you are free to use this method.\r\n\r\nBut &quot;recycling&quot; coroutine handles isn&#39;t really how the system is meant to be used at all. Handles are *meant* to eventually terminate. They are created, exist for a while, wait on some operation(s), schedule their resumption(s), and complete. That&#39;s the paradigm.\r\n\r\nAs such, the designed solution for your problem (avoiding allocating memory) is the provided promise-based allocation machinery. You feel that this isn&#39;t good enough, and therefore, you are forced to use less savory, more syntactically ugly mechanisms. That&#39;s generally what happens when your needs don&#39;t match up well with those provided by a design.\r\n\r\nIt may simply be a case of your needs not being matched up well with `co_await`-style suspend-up coroutines. Maybe a true fiber would be more useful for your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469445/you-must-use-infinite-loops-to-efficiently-reuse-coroutine-handles/58469973#58469973","title":"You must use infinite loops to efficiently reuse coroutine handles?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1218,"user_id":382546,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76838270770a11504bab725da4013f51?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mania","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/382546/mania"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58469973,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571544825,"creation_date":1571536510,"question_id":58469445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469445","body_markdown":"Given the following coroutine format:\r\n\r\n    auto myhelper = [&amp;]() -&gt; mytask&lt;int&gt; {\r\n      co_await some_event;\r\n      co_return 5;\r\n    }();\r\n\r\nIs the following truly the only way to ensure you&#39;re not going to get reallocations?\r\n\r\n    auto myhelper = [&amp;]() -&gt; mytask&lt;int&gt; {\r\n      while (true) {\r\n        co_await some_event;\r\n        co_yield 5;\r\n      }\r\n    }();\r\n\r\nBecause I&#39;m structuring all my coroutines this way, and can&#39;t even figure out a decent macro or function means to hide that cumbersome loop, nor the boilerplate in general (ie parenthesis after {}).\r\n\r\nI am aware of per-promise_type custom allocators, but consider the overhead to be too high (as size may vary, still requires checking free list, still effectively a reallocation, etc).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469445/you-must-use-infinite-loops-to-efficiently-reuse-coroutine-handles","title":"You must use infinite loops to efficiently reuse coroutine handles?"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11354,"user_id":3824919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HpYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824919/tom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571536723,"post_id":58469442,"comment_id":103272990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469442/why-would-nullpointerexception-occur-after-object-is-created#comment103272990_58469442"},{"owner":{"reputation":15228,"user_id":2089675,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sBz5q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"smac89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089675/smac89"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571536746,"post_id":58469442,"comment_id":103272992,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469442/why-would-nullpointerexception-occur-after-object-is-created#comment103272992_58469442"},{"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":7596371,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-58eM26B6Mqs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIQ/9thMLzhiKcI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Olivier L.

They work fine on my local machine. All the code seems to be fairly standard out-of-the-box template code. Here is my `_LoginPartial.cshtml`:\r\n\r\n```razor\r\n@if (Request.IsAuthenticated) {\r\n\tusing (Html.BeginForm(&quot;LogOff&quot;, &quot;Account&quot;, FormMethod.Post, new { id = &quot;logoutForm&quot;, @class = &quot;navbar-right&quot; }))\r\n\t{\r\n\t&lt;ul class=&quot;nav navbar-nav navbar-right&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(&quot;Hello &quot; + user.UserName + &quot;!&quot;, &quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Manage&quot;, routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { title = &quot;Manage&quot;, data_user_type = user.UserType, id = &quot;manage&quot; })&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;javascript:document.getElementById(&#39;logoutForm&#39;).submit()&quot; id=&quot;log-off&quot;&gt;Log off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n\t&lt;ul class=&quot;nav navbar-nav navbar-right&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(&quot;Register&quot;, &quot;Register&quot;, &quot;Account&quot;, routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = &quot;registerLink&quot; })&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;li&gt;@Html.ActionLink(&quot;Log in&quot;, &quot;Login&quot;, &quot;Account&quot;, routeValues: null, htmlAttributes: new { id = &quot;loginLink&quot; })&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my local machine, before logging in, the Register ActionLink goes to `localhost/MyApp/Account/Register` and the Login ActionLink goes to `localhost/MyApp/Account/Login`. After logging in, the BeginForm posts back to `localhost/MyApp/Account/LogOff` and the Manage ActionLink goes to `localhost/MyApp/Manage`. This is what I expect and is correct.\r\n\r\nWhen I deploy to Azure, before logging in, the Register ActionLink goes to `myappdev.azurewebsites.net/Account/Register` and the Login ActionLink goes to `myappdev.azurewebsites.net/Account/Login`. This is correct. However, after logging in, the BeginForm posts back to `myappdev.azurewebsites.net/MyApp/Account/LogOff` and the Manage ActionLink goes to `myappdev.azurewebsites.net/MyApp/Manage`. It is using the base URL from my local machine. Note that my Azure Web Service has a different name to the site name on my local machine.\r\n\r\nIt looks like authenticating somehow changes the base URL that ASP.NET uses to generate the URLs. It&#39;s very strange... What would be causing this?\r\n\r\nI am not (intentionally) using any areas. There is nothing exciting in my `RouteConfig.cs`:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {\r\n\troutes.IgnoreRoute(&quot;{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}&quot;);\r\n\r\n\troutes.MapRoute(\r\n\t\tname: &quot;Default&quot;,\r\n\t\turl: &quot;{controller}/{action}/{id}&quot;,\r\n\t\tdefaults: new { controller = &quot;Home&quot;, action = &quot;Index&quot;, id = UrlParameter.Optional }\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem happens when I publish directly to Azure from Visual Studio using Web Deploy, and when I use a DevOps pipeline. I can&#39;t see any obvious settings in the Azure portal. Any idea what might be happening here?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469439/asp-net-mvc5-action-links-have-incorrect-base-url-after-log-in","title":"ASP.NET MVC5 Action Links have incorrect base URL after log in"},{"tags":["ios","maccatalyst"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571536853,"post_id":58469436,"comment_id":103273006,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469436/maccatalyst-how-to-close-the-camera-require-for-mac-version-app#comment103273006_58469436"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12245114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74d2cb9239a60a62b5771e1eb7b53c50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Comex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12245114/comex"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571623268,"post_id":58469436,"comment_id":103290103,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469436/maccatalyst-how-to-close-the-camera-require-for-mac-version-app#comment103290103_58469436"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12245114,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74d2cb9239a60a62b5771e1eb7b53c50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Comex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12245114/comex"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571536952,"creation_date":1571536395,"last_edit_date":1571536952,"question_id":58469436,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469436","body_markdown":"I am very new to Mac development, and My catalyst app was reject for 4 times now.

An example could be the info page for the Mona Lisa of the Da Vinci exposition. \r\n\r\nThe app is realized as a PWA to enable offline usage. Currently I am using workbox to precache the app shell. GET requests for REST resources are cached as well. This allows the user to reload the Mona Lisa page after going offline, but the app fails on pages that haven&#39;t been loaded before.\r\n\r\nA solution would be precaching all the content together with the app shell.

The API can return multiple records male and/or female. My requirement is to  ensure only a single male employee to be rendered in UI. I have that achieved - not a problem.\r\n\r\nWhen I am writing tests using Jest and Enzyme I want to check that when I render I only render a single html element having a value &#39;M&#39;.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have tried - Jest / Enzyme does not like it.\r\n\r\n    expect (wrapper.find(&quot;div.tcolgender&quot;).text()).toEqual(&quot;M&quot;).toHaveLength(1);\r\n\r\nThis does not work. I looked at the Enzyme API - dont find any &#39;count&#39; or similar such method. Note - this is a &#39;full&#39; render and not a &#39;shallow&#39; render.\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469411/how-to-find-count-of-a-div-containing-specific-value-in-react-jest-and-enzyme","title":"How to find count of a div containing specific value in React, Jest and Enzyme"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","chainer"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12234424,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d270a9179e9e6b7be60a96e300cd99e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Syrinebh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12234424/syrinebh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571535977,"creation_date":1571535977,"question_id":58469407,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469407","body_markdown":"I tried to implement lda2vec model from this link https://github.com/cemoody/lda2vec?fbclid=IwAR0MhuY_mB_Ypw8LAH4egJ_Dt2QaWqZlQObtTZbWJYexAVk8T1ovo_v3xV8\r\nwhen I run  lda2vec_run.py Ihad this error &quot;cannot import name &#39;print_top_words_per_topic&#39;

Cloud Firestore is the newer of the two, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s better in your scenario.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469347/realtime-database-vs-firestore/58469378#58469378","title":"Realtime Database vs Firestore"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11806723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d143fc9bd6b84ca1f55c01184521bb69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Compile error end","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11806723/compile-error-end"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571545152,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571535532,"creation_date":1571534970,"question_id":58469347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469347","body_markdown":"I am building an app related to online bookings of Barbers in my city.I am planning to use Firebase to store my data and showing realtime updates.

to make a .VTT from the generated image in C#, so i know the height and width of my individual images in the sprite (120x80) and there is 64 images in total in the output image.\r\n\r\nFrom this i

possible though.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance if anyone as any ideas, its doable as ive seen Nodejs and Ruby

After reading these responses, @JohnAnderson is correct - `DrawingSpace.on_children()` gets called before `status_bar` exists within the `DrawingSpace`.  But why?  \r\n\r\nRemember that the root widget of the app here is a `ComicCreator` as defined in `comiccreator.kv`.  If you take a look at the instance of `DrawingSpace` there, `status_bar` is defined right after its own `id`, so it would seem that there shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  \r\n\r\nBut, we must remember that **kv class rules** are executed first. So looking at `drawingspace.kv`, we see that the `&lt;DrawingSpace&gt;` rule imports the python class (so it already knows about the `on_children` method) and then adds a `StickMan` **within the rule**.  All that happens BEFORE the INSTANCE of `DrawingSpace` gets a `status_bar` attribute added to it within the `comiccreator.kv` file.  \r\n\r\nSimply delete the `StickMan` from `drawingspace.kv` and the error will disappear.  If you want, you can add `StickMan` as a child of `DrawingSpace` in `comiccreator.kv` (after `status_bar` has been added) and you will visually get the same result with no error.\r\n\r\nLastly, you should remove `@RelativeLayout` from `&lt;DrawingSpace@RelativeLayout&gt;`. Once you define a custom class in python and inherit from a base class, you no longer need to inherit from a base class in kv using the `@` operator.  See the notes on page 10 for more info on that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58469331/kivy-attributeerror-with-property-defined-in-kv-file/58524570#58524570","title":"Kivy: AttributeError with property defined in kv file"}],"owner":{"reputation":811,"user_id":1241715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69ae2ece3cb83745d2302c67eaf44fb4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"madtyn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1241715/madtyn"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58489164,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571839094,"creation_date":1571534708,"question_id":58469331,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58469331","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n - **Python**: 3.6.8\r\n - **Kivy**: 1.9.0\r\n - **PyCharm**: 2019.2.3\r\n\r\nI&#39;m reading &quot;*Kivy – Interactive Applications and Games in Python Second Edition*&quot; while writing and testing the source code in the book.\r\n\r\nWhen I was finishing chapter 3 I got to this error:\r\n\r\n    Exception ignored in: &#39;kivy.properties.observable_list_dispatch&#39;\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n    File &quot;kivy/properties.pyx&quot;, line 579, in kivy.properties.Property.dispatch (/tmp/pip-install-rsswmpdy/kivy/kivy/properties.c:7216)\r\n    File &quot;kivy/_event.pyx&quot;, line 1214, in kivy._event.EventObservers.dispatch (/tmp/pip-install-rsswmpdy/kivy/kivy/_event.c:14036)\r\n    File &quot;kivy/_event.pyx&quot;, line 1120, in kivy._event.EventObservers._dispatch (/tmp/pip-install-rsswmpdy/kivy/kivy/_event.c:13194)\r\n    File &quot;/home/madtyn/PycharmProjects/learning_kivy/comics/drawingspace.py&quot;, line 8, in on_children\r\n        self.status_bar.counter = len(self.children)\r\n    AttributeError: &#39;DrawingSpace&#39; object has no attribute &#39;status_bar&#39;\r\n\r\nI tried to locate the error by comparing my code with the downloaded source code from the book, but I found no relevant difference.

The problem is if you create many data widgets your app might freeze for some time needed to create and add the data widget.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother approach is to have a KV rule defined. This will work if you add ~ 10-20 widgets. For more your app can be delayed.\r\n\r\nin kv file:\r\n```python\r\n&lt;MainView&gt;:\r\n    # main layout stuff\r\n\r\n&lt;MyBoxLayout&gt;:\r\n    orientation: &#39;vertical&#39; #horizontal is default\r\n    Label:\r\n        text: root.label_0_text\r\n    Label:\r\n        text: root.label_1_text\r\n    Label:\r\n        text: root.label_2_text\r\n    Label:\r\n        text: root.label_3_text\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then in your py file:\r\n```python\r\nclass MainView (BoxLayout):\r\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n        super(MainView, self).__init__(**kwargs)\r\n        for i in range(4):\r\n            lbl = MyBoxLayout()\r\n            lbl.label_0_text = str(i)  # Label.text only accepts strings\r\n            lbl.label_1_text = str(i)\r\n            lbl.label_2_text = str(i)\r\n            lbl.label_3_text = str(i)\r\n            self.add_widget(lbl)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass MyBoxLayout(BoxLayout):\r\n    label_0_text = StringProperty()\r\n    label_1_text = StringProperty()\r\n    label_2_text = StringProperty()\r\n    label_3_text = StringProperty()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe best approach is [RecycledView][1].

as defined by [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development by Fletcher Dunn][1].\r\n\r\nFirstly, notice that in a 2D coordinate system, you only need a single angle + magnitude to &quot;point&quot; to any point in 2D.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, in a 3D coordinate system, you [only need two angles][2] + magnitude to &quot;point&quot; to any point in 3D. The last angle (&quot;bank&quot; or &quot;roll&quot;) does not affect the location of a point in 3D. Instead it &quot;spins&quot; the arrow that would point to it. If the object is 360 degrees symmetrical, you won&#39;t see spin affecting the object at all. If the object is not symmetrical (e.g. an airplane) it will affect the object (e.g. tilting one wing towards the ground and the other towards the sky).\r\n\r\nSo the original question actually becomes, &quot;how do I find the heading angle, pitch angle, and magnitude to &quot;point&quot; to any point in 3D space?&quot;\r\n\r\nYou can easily figure this out using trigonometry functions. Imagine we have the point `(1,2,3)` and we&#39;re trying to calculate the heading, pitch, magnitude.\r\n\r\nFor the following example, let&#39;s use this diagram, where the left axis is X, up is Y, and right is Z. The point `(1,2,3)`, then is represented by the blue sphere.\r\n\r\n&gt; [![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n# 1. Find the magnitude\r\n\r\nFirst, let&#39;s find the easiest value, the magnitude. Luckily for us, the magnitude (length) between any two points is easy to find no matter how many dimensions we are in, simply by using the [Pythagorean theorem][4]. Since we are in 3D and we&#39;re calculating the distance from the origin to our point, our distance formula becomes:\r\n\r\n    magnitude = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)\r\n\r\nPlugging in our actual values:\r\n\r\n    magnitude = sqrt(1*1 + 2*2 + 3*3)\r\n              = 3.7416573868\r\n\r\nSo our **magnitude** (or length) is ~`3.741`.\r\n\r\n# 2. Find the heading\r\n\r\nNext, to find the heading, notice that we just care about rotation about the XZ plane, and we don&#39;t care about the Y-axis at all. If we were to &quot;flatten&quot; the 3D space into 2D, it [becomes trivial to find the heading][5].\r\n\r\nWe can draw a triangle that forms a 90 degree angle with the X-axis (red triangle) and then calculate that angle. Recall from trigonometry  `tan(angle) = opposite / adjacent`, and solving for `angle`, we get `angle = arctan(opposite / adjacent)`.\r\n\r\nIn this case &quot;adjacent&quot; is a known quantity (`redAdjacent = x = 1`), and &quot;opposite&quot; is known too (`redOpposite = z = 3`). Instead of using arctan to solve the equation though, we want to use [atan2][6] since it&#39;ll handle all the different cases of x and y for us.\r\n\r\nSo we have:\r\n\r\n    heading = atan2(redOpposite, redAdjacent)\r\n\r\nPlugging in our actual values:\r\n\r\n    heading = atan2(3, 1)\r\n            = 1.249045772398\r\n\r\nso our **heading** is `1.249` rad, or ~`72&#176;`.\r\n\r\n# 3. Find the pitch\r\n\r\nFinally we need to find the pitch. Similarly to what we did with the heading, we can flatten the the 3D space into 2D along the plane that contains these three points: (A) the origin `(0,0,0)`, (B) our point `(1,2,3)`, and (C) our point as it would project onto the XZ plane `(1,0,3)` (e.g. by setting 0 for the Y-value).\r\n\r\nIf we draw a triangle between all 3 of these points, you will notice that they form a right-triangle again (green triangle). We can simply calculate the angle using `arctan2` again.\r\n\r\nWe already calculated the green hypotenuse in step 1 (i.e. the magnitude of our vector):\r\n\r\n    greenHypotenuse = sqrt(x*x + y*y + z*z)\r\n                    = 3.7416573868\r\n\r\nWe also know the opposite of the green triangle is the same as the y-value:\r\n\r\n    greenOpposite = y\r\n                  = 2\r\n\r\nUsing the pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent angle:\r\n\r\n    greenOpposite^2 + greenAdjacent^2 = greenHypotenuse^2\r\n    y*y + greenAdjacent^2 = x*x + y*y + z*z\r\n    greenAdjacent^2 = x*x + z*z\r\n    greenAdjacent = sqrt(x*x + z*z)\r\n\r\nNotice that another way to calculate the adjacent length of the green triangle is to notice that `redHypotenuse == greenAdjacent`, and we could find `redHypotenuse` using:\r\n\r\n    redHypotenuse^2 = redAdjacent^2 + redOpposite^2\r\n                    = x*x + z*z\r\n    redHypotenuse = sqrt(x*x + z*z)\r\n\r\nPlugging in actual values, we get:\r\n\r\n    greenAdjacent = sqrt(1*1 + 3*3)\r\n                  = 3.1622776602\r\n\r\nSo now that we know the adjacent and opposite lengths of the green triangle, we can use `arctan2` again:\r\n\r\n    pitch = atan2(greenOpposite, greenAdjacent)\r\n          = atan2(2, 3.1622776602)\r\n          = 0.563942641356\r\n\r\nSo our **pitch** is `0.5634` radians, or about `32&#176;`.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nIf you were to draw a line from the origin, with length `3.741`, heading `1.249` rad, and pitch `0.564` rad, it would extend from `(0,0,0)` to `(1,2,3)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.amazon.com/Math-Primer-Graphics-Game-Development/dp/1568817231/\r\n  [2]: https://math.stackexchange.com/a/726788/2718\r\n  [3]:
