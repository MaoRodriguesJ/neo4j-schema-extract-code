Has anybody experienced the same and knows how to deal with this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210228/datadog-string-encoding-when-character-is-not-from-english-alphabet","title":"Datadog string encoding when character is not from English alphabet"},{"tags":["java","node.js","maven","npm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69700,"user_id":296328,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DSpH6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khmarbaise","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/296328/khmarbaise"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570112064,"post_id":58210226,"comment_id":102817804,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210226/what-is-the-equvalent-of-npm-install-in-maven#comment102817804_58210226"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3034,"user_id":774719,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUnkD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"osdamv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/774719/osdamv"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570056743,"creation_date":1570056743,"answer_id":58210294,"question_id":58210226,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210294","body_markdown":"    mvn dependency:resolve\r\nIs worth take a look to mvn life [cycles][1] \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210226/what-is-the-equvalent-of-npm-install-in-maven/58210294#58210294","title":"What is the equvalent of npm install in maven"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3034,"user_id":774719,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KUnkD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"osdamv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/774719/osdamv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570057041,"post_id":58210313,"comment_id":102798118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210226/what-is-the-equvalent-of-npm-install-in-maven/58210313#comment102798118_58210313"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":12156361,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad895a55c8784e96d849a3d496a603e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12156361/fran"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570056882,"creation_date":1570056882,"answer_id":58210313,"question_id":58210226,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210313","body_markdown":"Maven doesn&#39;t have an install command.

I&#39;m totally get stuck about this tricky problem, can anybody help me?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210220/find-an-element-in-unsorted-array-without-array-length","title":"Find an element in unsorted array without array length"},{"tags":["c++11","std-pair","stdinitializerlist"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":367767,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570062339,"post_id":58210217,"comment_id":102799104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210217/how-to-mix-auto-with-brace-initialization-to-return-a-stdpair-properly#comment102799104_58210217"},{"owner":{"reputation":37037,"user_id":1670129,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32370783314a7efabe09b6cfadb11b12?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Igor Tandetnik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1670129/igor-tandetnik"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570076058,"post_id":58210217,"comment_id":102801355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210217/how-to-mix-auto-with-brace-initialization-to-return-a-stdpair-properly#comment102801355_58210217"}],"owner":{"reputation":450,"user_id":6864265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f01bd0f9716eca1ad35cf30c47ae8f6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Itachi Uchiwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6864265/itachi-uchiwa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":450,"user_id":6864265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f01bd0f9716eca1ad35cf30c47ae8f6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Itachi Uchiwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6864265/itachi-uchiwa"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570057088,"creation_date":1570055991,"last_edit_date":1570057088,"question_id":58210217,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210217","body_markdown":"I have this example which is a function that returns a `std::pair` which holds a string value and its size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tstd::pair&lt;std::string, int&gt; getLastPair(const vector&lt;string&gt;&amp; vec) {\r\n\t\treturn{ vec.back(), vec.back().size() };\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tint main(){\r\n\r\n\t\tvector&lt;string&gt; names{ &quot;An&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;Day&quot;, &quot;Keeps&quot;, &quot;The&quot;, \r\n\t\t&quot;Doctor&quot;, &quot;Away&quot;};\r\n\r\n\t\tauto p{getLastPair(names)}; // ok p is a pair&lt;string, int&gt;\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; p.first &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; p.second &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(p).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\r\n\t\tauto p2 = { getLastPair(names) }; // why it is not a pair but an initializer list?\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; typeid(p2).name() &lt;&lt; std::endl; // initializer list\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tstd::pair&lt;std::string, int&gt; p3 = { getLastPair(names) }; // ok a pair\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; p3.first &lt;&lt; &quot; : &quot; &lt;&lt; p3.second &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n\r\n\t\tdecltype (getLastPair(names)) p4 = { getLastPair(names) }; // ok\r\n\t\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; p4.first &lt;&lt; &quot; : &quot; &lt;&lt; p4.second &lt;&lt; std::endl; // ok\r\n\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n* Why the first initialization returns a `pair` as expected but the second one `p2` is not a `pair` but an `initializer_list` instead?\r\n\r\n* As you can see `p3` works fine (returns a pair) aslong as I&#39;ve provided the type explicitly!?

So let&#39;s think through some examples:\r\n\r\n1. If the stairs has 1 step, then there&#39;s one way to go up: take 1 step\r\n\r\n2. If the stairs has 2 steps, then you have two choices:\r\n    * Go up 1 step and then you have 1 step remaining (refer to case 1)\r\n    * Go up 2 steps and then you are finished\r\n\r\n3. If the stairs has 3 steps, then you have three choices:\r\n    * Go up 1 step, and then you have 2 steps remaining (refer to case 2)\r\n    * Go up 2 steps, and then you have 1 step remaining (refer to case 1)\r\n    * Go up 3 steps, and then you are finished.\r\n\r\n4. If the stairs has more than 3 steps, call this number `n`.\r\n    * Go up 1 step, and then you have `n-1` steps remaining. (refer to case 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the value of `n-1`.\r\n    * Go up 2 step, and then you have `n-2` steps remaining. (refer to case 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the value of `n-2`.\r\n    * Go up 3 step, and then you have `n-2` steps remaining. (refer to case 1, 2, 3, or 4, depending on the value of `n-3`)\r\n\r\nThis description leads us to see a recursive relationship. The number of ways to traverse `n` steps is the same as the number of ways to traverse `n-1` steps plus the number of ways to traverse `n-2` steps the number of ways to traverse `n-3` steps.\r\n\r\nTo translate this all into code, I would write a function `go_up(n)` that implements the rules described above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210181/how-many-ways-to-go-up-a-n-step-stairs/58210269#58210269","title":"How many ways to go up a N-step stairs?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53099,"user_id":1440565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec430cc01ef4cf4ae63ebbe9e8596f72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Code-Apprentice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1440565/code-apprentice"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570119539,"post_id":58215186,"comment_id":102821731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210181/how-many-ways-to-go-up-a-n-step-stairs/58215186#comment102821731_58215186"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11064426,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XB5FI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Thyme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11064426/thyme"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570091407,"creation_date":1570091407,"answer_id":58215186,"question_id":58210181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58215186","body_markdown":"The answer by Code-Apprentice is very good, so I want to contribute a different approach:&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nWriting down the solutions for the first few flight of stairs I quickly noticed a pattern.

I would like to extract the data from this list so as to have some tidy data.\r\n\r\nHere is a short example:\r\n\r\n    data_1 &lt;- tibble(year = c(2015, 2016), \r\n                     pop = c(100, 200))\r\n    \r\n    data_2 &lt;- tibble(year = c(2015, 2016), \r\n                     pop = c(300, 500))\r\n    \r\n    data_combined &lt;- list(data_1, data_2)\r\n    \r\n    x &lt;- tibble(country = (c(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;)), \r\n                data = data_combined)\r\n    \r\n    print(x)\r\n    # A tibble: 2 x 2\r\n      country data            \r\n      &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;list&gt;          \r\n    1 1       &lt;tibble [2 x 2]&gt;\r\n    2 2       &lt;tibble [2 x 2]&gt;\r\n\r\n    print(x$data)\r\n    [[1]]\r\n    # A tibble: 2 x 2\r\n       year   pop\r\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n    1  2015   100\r\n    2  2016   200\r\n    \r\n    [[2]]\r\n    # A tibble: 2 x 2\r\n       year   pop\r\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n    1  2015   300\r\n    2  2016   500\r\n\r\nWhat I would like is the following tidy data format (I don&#39;t mind if its a data.frame or a tibble):\r\n\r\n      country year pop\r\n            1 2015 100\r\n            1 2016 200\r\n            2 2015 300\r\n            2 2016 500\r\n\r\nI assume the easiest way to do this is to return the list that is `y$data`, keeping the country field, and call: `do.call(rbind)` on that. I don&#39;t know how to do the first part. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I am getting this all wrong and having data in this format is useful. If that is the case, and there is a way for effectively handling tibbles with lists of tibbles within them, then I would welcome any information on that. \r\n\r\nThe context for all this is that I am trying to deal with data generated by this API: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/eia/eia.pdf. The API is limited to only generate 100 rows for each call. I assume that for this reason the authors have used this data format to allow one to get more data for each row. If you want to understand a general example see below:\r\n\r\n    #load libraries\r\n    library(&quot;eia&quot;)\r\n    library(&quot;dplyr&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    #set API key for the session\r\n    eia_set_key(key = &quot;[YOUR_KEY_HERE]&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    #select a variable of interest by looking through: eia_cats() -&gt; eia_child_cats(2134384)\r\n    anth_production &lt;- eia_cats(2134515) %&gt;% #select data for Anthracite (as a list)\r\n      .$childseries %&gt;% #subset the childseries element of the list\r\n      filter(units == &quot;Million Metric Tons of Oil Equivalent&quot;) %&gt;% #filter to only have MMTOe\r\n      .$series_id #subset the IDs to use in the eia_series() call \r\n    \r\n    #call the eia_series() function of the API\r\n    anth_production_tibble &lt;- eia_series(id = anth_production)\r\n    \r\n`anth_production_tibble` now appears in the same format that i generated above in my reproducible example. I will write a function to deal with the 100 row limit at a later point.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210170/pull-list-from-tibble-for-tidy-data","title":"Pull list from tibble for tidy data"},{"tags":["java","if-statement","enums"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":9062626,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b71f5b2e940f9af95dfe6bb89b09920?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Heanzy Zabala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9062626/heanzy-zabala"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570055818,"post_id":58210167,"comment_id":102797836,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210167/if-else-if-error-for-a-program-using-enums#comment102797836_58210167"},{"owner":{"reputation":9101,"user_id":2055998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Vx3A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PM 77-1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2055998/pm-77-1"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570056019,"post_id":58210167,"comment_id":102797894,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210167/if-else-if-error-for-a-program-using-enums#comment102797894_58210167"},{"owner":{"reputation":1977,"user_id":772521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c82cd3d728849548aa896ce780672d33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JLewkovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/772521/jlewkovich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570058344,"post_id":58210167,"comment_id":102798365,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210167/if-else-if-error-for-a-program-using-enums#comment102798365_58210167"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11564363,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/defdfba507772a9a87c8d4ad993d833a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bella26","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11564363/bella26"},"last_editor":{"reputation":35568,"user_id":3890632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hNkgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"khelwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3890632/khelwood"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570056033,"creation_date":1570055647,"last_edit_date":1570056033,"question_id":58210167,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210167","body_markdown":"I&#39;m supposed to write a code that generates a random card using if else if statements and enums.

And I use the [Notification.Builder][1] to set a color for the action and icon tinting. Here is the full code to create the notification.\r\n``` lang-kotlin\r\nval notification = Notification.Builder(context,\r\n                CHANNEL_ID)\r\n                .setContentTitle(title)\r\n                .setContentText(mainText)\r\n                .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.small_icon)\r\n                .setContentIntent(pendingIntent)\r\n                .addAction(Notification.Action.Builder(\r\n                        Icon.createWithResource(\r\n                                this, R.drawable.action_icon),\r\n                        getString(R.string.action_title),\r\n                        actionPendingIntent)\r\n                        .build())\r\n                .setStyle(Notification.InboxStyle()\r\n                        .addLine(mainText)\r\n                        .addLine(subText)\r\n                        .addLine(secondSubText)\r\n                        .setBigContentTitle(title)\r\n                        .setSummaryText(summaryText))\r\n                .setColor(getColor(R.color.notification_accent))\r\n                .build()\r\n```\r\nThe color `R.color.notification_accent` is declared both in `values` and in `values-night`, and has different colors. Also the base theme of the application extends from `Theme.MaterialComponents.DayNight`. And the whole application changes correctly between the themes when dark theme is enabled/disabled in the device.\r\n\r\nWhen I create the notification it is always created correctly, so when dark theme is on, the color from `values-night` is used, and when it&#39;s off the `values` color is used.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when the theme changes and the notification is already visible. I can see the notification is actually changing since the background changes from dark to light, but the color of the action is not changing.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing this happens because the color is not part of the notification theme, but I&#39;m not sure how that can be handled, or if it&#39;s a bug in the [Notification.Builder][1].\n\nEdit:\nThis behaviour happens on an emulator running API 29. When running the app on a device the behaviour is correct, the colors change.

I tried the `merge_asof` function but this does nearest neighbourhood interpolation and I did not get all the time stamps back.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210149/interpolate-pandas-frame-using-time-index-from-another-data-frame","title":"interpolate pandas frame using time index from another data frame"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","typescript","loops"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2095053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3920d16a913f3c1eaf3ce218ebbee975?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Filippo Rivolta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2095053/filippo-rivolta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570099385,"post_id":58210280,"comment_id":102810912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210148/react-typescript-map-loop-interface-error/58210280#comment102810912_58210280"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2095053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3920d16a913f3c1eaf3ce218ebbee975?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Filippo Rivolta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2095053/filippo-rivolta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570129246,"post_id":58210280,"comment_id":102825792,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210148/react-typescript-map-loop-interface-error/58210280#comment102825792_58210280"},{"owner":{"reputation":21077,"user_id":8526705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/buwQ5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dacre Denny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8526705/dacre-denny"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2095053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3920d16a913f3c1eaf3ce218ebbee975?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Filippo Rivolta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2095053/filippo-rivolta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570135237,"post_id":58210280,"comment_id":102828227,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210148/react-typescript-map-loop-interface-error/58210280#comment102828227_58210280"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21077,"user_id":8526705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/buwQ5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dacre Denny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8526705/dacre-denny"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570056535,"creation_date":1570056535,"answer_id":58210280,"question_id":58210148,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58210280","body_markdown":"The reason for this error is that the `routes` argument of type `object[]` cannot be cast to a type of `RoutesType[]`.\r\n\r\nThe reason that TypeScript is attempting this type-cast is that type of `routes` is inferred and expected to be `RoutesType[]`, due to the type of the `prop` argument on the map callback.\r\n\r\nA fix would be to revise your `createLinks` function signature like this:\r\n\r\n     /* Update routes to RoutesType[] */\r\n     const createLinks = (routes: RoutesType[]) =&gt;

The output of `Math.round()` is either an `int` or `long`, but definitely not a `double` so you&#39;re adding confusion for yourself by storing it as a `double` – instead, store the result as `long`. From there, when you calculate `hundreds`, you need to divide by 10,000 not 1,000. Also, store that as an `int`, not a `double`. Here&#39;s what that would look like:\r\n```\r\nlong remainder = Math.round(1274.56 * 100);\r\nint hundreds = (int) remainder / 10000;\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;hundreds: &quot; + hundreds);\r\n```\r\nThe above prints out &quot;12&quot; for `hundreds`, which is what you want.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is how you&#39;re calculating `remainder`. You want everything that&#39;s &quot;left over&quot; from the prior calculation which you do by using `%` (modulus operator), and also use 10,000 instead of 1,000. For the `hundreds` case, it would be this:\r\n```\r\nremainder = remainder % 10000;\r\nSystem.out.println(&quot;remainder: &quot; + remainder);\r\n```\r\nThe above code would print this:\r\n```\r\nremainder: 7456\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should give you enough to get the rest of your math working properly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210131/i-need-help-making-change-in-java-it-doesnt-give-out-change-correctly/58210253#58210253","title":"I need help making change in java.

One Fully uncontrolled components for the resettable counter \r\n 2. One Fully controlled one for the non resettable counter\r\n 3.

I would appreciate any advice on the *logic* part of this problem, thanks!\r\n\r\nSo far I managed to develop the algorithm provided below, but it still makes duplicates and doesn&#39;t group keyword 100% right (some keywords should be in the same group but they are not).\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction makeKeywordGroupsNew(results: Result[], uid: string): Group[] {\r\n  let dataset = results;\r\n  let groups: any[] = [];\r\n  \r\n  // loop thru all records in dataset\r\n  dataset.forEach((current: Result) =&gt; {\r\n    // initialize the group with the current keyword in it\r\n    const group = { volume: 0, items: [current] };\r\n    // remove the current keyword from the dataset\r\n    dataset = dataset.filter(el =&gt; el.keyword !== current.keyword);\r\n    // loop thru the new dataset and push the other keyword into the group if it has &gt;=3 urls in common with current keyword\r\n    dataset.forEach((other: Result) =&gt; {\r\n      const urlsInCommon = _.intersection(current.urls, other.urls);\r\n      if (urlsInCommon.length &gt;= 3) {\r\n        group.items.push(other);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    // sum the keyword volumes to form the group volume - not important for the core logic\r\n    // @ts-ignore\r\n    group.volume = _.sum(group.items.map(item =&gt; item.volume));\r\n    // sort keywords in the formed group by volume - not important for the core logic\r\n    // @ts-ignore\r\n    group.items = group.items\r\n      .sort((a, b) =&gt; {\r\n        if (a.volume &lt; b.volume) return 1;\r\n        if (a.volume &gt; b.volume) return -1;\r\n        return 0;\r\n      })\r\n      .map(el =&gt; el.keyword);\r\n    // add the newly formed group to the groups array (the result)\r\n    groups.push(group);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // exclude the groups with only one keyword inside\r\n  groups = groups.filter(group =&gt; group.items.length &gt; 1);\r\n  // delete keyword duplicates inside of the group\r\n  groups = groups.map(group =&gt; ({ ...group, items: _.uniq(group.items) }));\r\n  // form the correct result object shape - not important for the core logic\r\n  return groups.map(group =&gt; ({\r\n    uid,\r\n    main: group.items[0],\r\n    keywords: group.items.slice(1, group.length),\r\n    volume: group.volume\r\n  }));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected the output of [input.json](https://pastebin.com/ZiAsXhKP) to be [output.csv](https://pastebin.com/DQKZRXSr), but my solution either puts fewer keywords in a group or makes the wrong groups.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210062/how-to-write-grouping-algorithm-that-groups-items-in-dataset-by-having-3-or-more","title":"How to write grouping algorithm that groups items in dataset by having 3 or more similar properties"},{"tags":["facebook"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570176032,"post_id":58210054,"comment_id":102838223,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210054/facebook-develope-platform#comment102838223_58210054"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10291397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c58e9765442b05cfe991dc52e8181c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JDB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10291397/jdb"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570054798,"creation_date":1570054798,"question_id":58210054,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210054","body_markdown":"Today I created a development account on Facebook.

Could it be related in some way to the coarser version of the mesh (i.e. before bisection)?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210049/hexagons-from-triangles-on-sphere-constructing-a-hexagonal-geodesic-grid-from-i","title":"Hexagons from triangles on sphere: constructing a hexagonal/geodesic grid from icosahedronal grid (North Pole only)"},{"tags":["javascript","angular","twitter-bootstrap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5516,"user_id":4283738,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcb938f3ad5a68706c055de350612b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"joyBlanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4283738/joyblanks"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570069480,"post_id":58210046,"comment_id":102800321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58210046/loop-on-dynamic-array-bootstrap-rows-with-only-two-elements-in-one-row#comment102800321_58210046"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9964718,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7716c09a80cbec04543ed5327c699b1a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pavan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9964718/pavan"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570054774,"creation_date":1570054774,"question_id":58210046,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58210046","body_markdown":"I have a dynamic array in component.ts file and I need to show it in UI using bootstrap grid model.

What I wanted was an http client that would just pass me back the http response regardless of the status, and only throw an error if no response was returned (e.g. non-existent domain). The Angular HttpClient won&#39;t do that. There may be another http client library out there that would, but life&#39;s too short.\r\n\r\nI only need the HTTP Status and the body from the response, so I created this error handler:\r\n\r\n      private handleError(error: HttpErrorResponse) {\r\n        if (error.status == 0)\r\n          return of({ status: 600, body: &quot;Unexpected error.

Notice that if there is no HTTP response then I set a fictitious HTTP Status 600, in which case I have to provide the missing error message that would have been in the body. Also I had to change the data type of the put from HttpResponse string to any.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58209997/angular-httpclient-how-to-get-raw-http-response-even-if-error/58294934#58294934","title":"Angular HttpClient: How to get raw HTTP response, even if error"}],"owner":{"reputation":120,"user_id":4297614,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94cf9e9c5ef18ce547b4306074fcd666?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chuck Bevitt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4297614/chuck-bevitt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10915,"user_id":1164465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xsyv3.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christopher Peisert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1164465/christopher-peisert"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570574900,"creation_date":1570054419,"last_edit_date":1570062482,"question_id":58209997,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58209997","body_markdown":"In an Angular service using `HttpClient`, I&#39;ve created a method that returns the raw HTTP response from a `POST`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttpOptions = {\r\n  headers: new HttpHeaders({\r\n    &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;\r\n    //observe: &#39;response&#39;\r\n  }),\r\n  observe: &#39;response&#39; as &#39;body&#39;\r\n};\r\n    \r\nforgotLogin(requestData: PUMRequestData): Observable&lt;HttpResponse&lt;string&gt;&gt; {\r\n  return this.http.post&lt;HttpResponse&lt;string&gt;&gt;(&quot;http://...&quot;, requestData, this.httpOptions);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in my component, I just look at the status and body from the raw http response.\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.api.forgotLogin(pumRequestData).subscribe(response =&gt; {\r\n  this.hStatus = response.status;\r\n  this.hBody = response.body;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that if the response status is not in the `200` series, then `HttpClient` throws an error.
