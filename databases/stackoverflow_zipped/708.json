this statement:\r\n```\r\ntunnel = SSHTunnelForwarder(\r\n    (&#39;ssh-host&#39;, 22),\r\n    ssh_pkey=&quot;my-keypair&quot;,\r\n    ssh_username=&quot;my-user&quot;,\r\n    ssh_password=&quot;my-pw&quot;,\r\n    remote_bind_address=(&#39;database-host&#39;, db-port)\r\n    )\r\n```\r\nAn SSH tunnel is established to the ssh server at *ssh-host* on port 22 and the remote tunnel endpoint is instructed to connect to the database server running on *database-host* on port *db-port* (e.g. 3306).  But the essential point to note is that this tunnel is only established once the client makes the connection.  \r\n\r\nBut how does the client make the connection, you may ask?  Well, part of the functionality of the SSHTunnelForwarder is that it listens for connections on a random port on the localhost.  So when you connect to localhost using your client application (this is what happens in the *create_engine()* and *engine.connect()* calls), the SSH tunnel will read data from that connection, push it across the tunnel and deliver it to the remote endpoint on that side of the tunnel (i.e. the database server at database-host:db-port).\r\n\r\nSo what you are missing in your code is that the database connection should be targeting localhost, as in the following (you should be able to use the IP address 127.0.0.1 or the hostname *localhost*):\r\n```\r\nengine = create_engine(&quot;mysql+pymysql://db-username:db-pw@127.0.0.1:&quot;+port+&quot;/dbname&quot;,encoding=&#39;latin1&#39;, echo=True, pool_recycle=280)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373690/connecting-to-mysql-database-via-ssh-over-a-jump-host-using-python-3/58394036#58394036","title":"Connecting to MySQL database via SSH (over a jump host) using python 3"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7510981,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1595588780456946/picture?type=large","display_name":"Murti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7510981/murti"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571140219,"creation_date":1571044881,"question_id":58373690,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373690","body_markdown":"I am trying to build a connection between python and my MySQL-Database (which is in AWS). \r\n\r\nThe SSH tunnel works fine, the matters happens if its about starting the connection to the database afterwards.

problem with this code seems like your input is not `Integer` based. `s.hasNext()` checks for input that could be cast to `String`. You probably should use `s.hasNextInt()` here. Or you could change the `s.nextInt()` to `s.next()` it will take input as a `String`. I am providing two possible solutions, then you can decide which one fulfills your requirements.\r\n\r\n**Solution 1:** \r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    while (s.hasNextInt()) {\r\n        list.add(s.nextInt());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this solution, your code will only take `Integer` as input. Because `s.hasNextInt()` restricts the input to `Integer` value. If it encounters anything other than the `Integer` value then the `while` loop will exit.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2:** \r\n\r\n    ArrayList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    while (s.hasNext()) {\r\n        list.add(s.next());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn this solution, your code will take `String` as input. It won&#39;t fail whether your input contains `&quot;abc&quot;` or `7` or `33.32` etc. It will save all of them as a `String` value.

For example, the early datetimes have a spacing of 10 minutes, but the later datetimes have a spacing of six hours. \r\n\r\nIt would be good to be able to put in the sampling as an input and get out data based on that sampling rate so that I can see which one works best. \r\n\r\nIt would also be good that if I choose say 3 hour sampling this is simply ignored for spacing of above 3 hours and no change to the data is made in this case (i.e. datetime spacings of 10 minutes are averaged, but datetime spacings of 6 hours are left unaffected).\r\n\r\nAll of this needs to come out in either a pandas dataframe with date as column headers and depth as the index, or as a numpy array and separate list of datetimes. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m fairly new to Python, and this is my first question on stackoverflow!!

is sadly completely impossible to wrap your brain around the logic which defines the almost infinite multitude of [date-input formats][1] which the command `date` can handle. It is, however, massively impressive that they manage to do it so well! Especially when you realise the plethora of date-time formats that humanity came up with.\r\n\r\nWhat you discovered is something called [military timezones][3], yet another form of writing date-times, but an organised one. So when you ask `date` to convert &quot;2019-10-07S&quot;, it will assume &quot;2019-10-07T00:00:00&quot; in the Sierra timezone (UTC-6). Hence, your result should be &quot;2019-10-06T18:00:00 UTC&quot;. However, you are receiving &quot;2019-10-07T02:00:00&quot; which is not the same. That is because `date` returns the format string in your local time-zone and it tells me that you currently have your system set to UTC+8.\r\n\r\nWe can validate this as:\r\n\r\n    $ TZ=&quot;Australia/Perth&quot; date -d &quot;2019-10-07S&quot; &quot;+%FT%T %z %Z&quot;\r\n    2019-10-07T02:00:00 +0800 AWST\r\n    $ TZ=&quot;UTC-8&quot; date -d &quot;2019-10-07S&quot; &quot;+%FT%T %z %Z&quot;\r\n    2019-10-07T02:00:00 +0800 UTC\r\n\r\n**Note:** Be aware that `TZ=&quot;UTC-8&quot;` actually means UTC+8. This notation is interpreted as a Posix timezone. (See: [U&amp;L: Why does TZ=UTC-8 produce dates that are UTC+8?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/104088/))\r\n\r\n[![ISO 8601 was published on 06/05/88 and most recently amended on

question is how to allow users to extract information from arbitrary hypertext [documents]. This means that solving the problem of &quot;which elements to scrape&quot; is just *part* of it. The other part is &quot;how to transform the set of elements to scrape into a data set that the user ultimately is interested in&quot;.\r\n\r\nMeaning that CSS selectors alone won&#39;t do. You need data transformation, which will deal with the set of elements as input and yield the data set of interest as output. In your question, this is illustrated by the case of just wanting the text content of some elements, or entire document, but as if the `a` elements were not there. That is your transformation procedure in this particular case.\r\n\r\nYou do state, however, that you want to allow users to specify what they want to scrape. This translates to your transformation procedure having other variables and possibly being general with respect to the kind of transformations it can do.\r\n\r\nWith this in mind, I would suggest you look into technologies like [XSLT](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-10/). XSLT, for one, is designed for these things -- transforming data.\r\n\r\nDepending on how computer literate you expect your users to be, you might need to encapsulate the raw power and complexity of XSLT, giving users a simple UI which translates their queries to XSLT and then feeds the resulting XSL stylesheets to an XSLT processor, for example. In any case, XSLT itself will be able to carry a lot of load. You also won&#39;t need both XSLT _and_ CSS selectors -- the former uses XPath which you can utilize and even expose to users.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s consider the following short example of a HTML document you want scraped:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n\t&lt;body&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;p&gt;I think the document you are looking for is at &lt;a href=&quot;example.com&quot;&gt;example.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want all text extracted but not `a` elements, the following XSL stylesheet will configure an XSLT processor to yield exactly that:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot; ?&gt;\r\n&lt;stylesheet version=&quot;1.0&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot;&gt;\r\n\t&lt;output method=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;\r\n\t&lt;template match=&quot;a&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- empty template element, meaning that the transformation result for every &#39;a&#39; element is empty text --&gt;\r\n&lt;/stylesheet&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe result of transforming the HTML document with the above XSL stylesheet document is the following text:\r\n\r\n&gt; I think the document you are looking for is at .\r\n\r\nNote how the `a` element is &quot;stripped&quot; leaving an empty space between &quot;at&quot; and the sentence punctuation (`.`). The `template` element, being empty, configures the XSLT processor to not produce any text when transforming `a` elements (`&quot;a&quot;` is a valid, if very simple, XPath expression, by the way -- it selects all `a` elements). This is all part of XSLT, of course.\r\n\r\nI have tested this with [Free Online XSL Transformer](http://www.freeformatter.com/xsl-transformer.html) which uses the very potent SAX library.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can cover one particular use case -- yours -- with JavaScript, without XSLT. But how are you going to let your users express what they want scraped? You will probably need to invent some [simple] language -- which might as well involve XSLT anyway.\r\n\r\nXSLT isn&#39;t readily available across different user agents or JavaScript runtimes, not out of the box -- native XSLT 1.0 implementations are indeed provided by both Firefox and Chrome (with the `XSLTProcessor` class) but are not specified by any standards body and so may be missing in your particular runtime environment. You may be able to find a suitable JavaScript implementation though, but in any case you can invoke the scraper on the server side.\r\n\r\nEncapsulating the XSLT language behind some simpler query language and user interface, is something you will need to decide on -- if you&#39;re going to give your users the kind of possibilities you say you want them to have, they need to express their queries somehow, whether through a WYSIWYG form or through textual expression.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373638/how-to-select-all-tags-except-anchors-neither-anchors-inside-another-element-w/58376438#58376438","title":"How to select all tags except anchors (neither anchors inside another element) with document.querySelectorAll?"}],"owner":{"reputation":334,"user_id":3462919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d88753bc395e3ace3be6371b987cfbc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Porkopek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3462919/porkopek"},"last_editor":{"reputation":334,"user_id":3462919,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d88753bc395e3ace3be6371b987cfbc9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Porkopek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3462919/porkopek"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58376438,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571063292,"creation_date":1571044721,"last_edit_date":1571048674,"question_id":58373638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373638","body_markdown":"**edit**: Is it possible to get all the **inner text** from tags in HTML document except text from anchor tags `&lt;a&gt;` (neither the the text from `&lt;a&gt;`  anchors inside another elements) with the `document.querySelectorAll` method?\r\n\r\nMy program has an input field that allows users to insert some selector to get the text for certain tags in a given site page.\r\nSo, if I want to insert a selector that gets text from all nodes except `&lt;a&gt;` tags, how can I accomplish that?\r\nI mean `*:not(a)` does not work, because it selects tags that may have `&lt;a&gt;`descendants and `not()` selector does not accept complex selectors, so `*:not(* a)` does not work.\r\n\r\n**I know I could delete those nodes from document first**, **but is it possible to accomplish this task only selecting those nodes I want with the `document.querySelectorAll` method?**\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n      &lt;... lots of other tags with text inside&gt;\r\n        &lt;div&gt;\r\n          &lt;p&gt; one paragraph &lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;a&gt; one link &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/...&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\nI want all the text in the html except &quot;one link&quot;\r\n\r\n**edit:**\r\nIf you do `document.querySelectorAll(&#39;*:not(a)&#39;)`, you  select the `div`, that has inside an `a` element.

This example shows cross region content based load balancing. I want to check if a similar configuration(based on URL maps) can be used  to set up a DR site for an application in another region. For example,\r\n\r\n - An instance group in europe-west3 region (Primary). URL map entry added at the time of load balancer configuration.\r\n - Another instance group in europe-west4 region (DR).\r\n\r\nThe idea is to update the URL map entry to point to the second (DR) instance group when a DR procedure is invoked.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\n 1. Assuming the DR instance group is always up(active), how long does it take for a URL map entry update to start routing traffic to the second(DR) instance group?\r\n 2. Is there another way to start routing traffic to the second instance group without a URL map update? Is it possible to configure a DNS setting to create a similar effect?  \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Update 15Oct2019**\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the best option  appears to be setting up a multi region deployment with URL map configured to both regions. GFEs will ensure that traffic is served to users from the primary region - assuming that the primary region is closest to users. However there is a chance of traffic overflow to secondary(DR) region due to reasons other than a DR trigger - as listed in [this][2] useful article - which needs to be accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/#overview\r\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/solutions/about-capacity-optimization-with-global-lb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373618/how-to-set-up-a-multi-region-gcp-deployment","title":"How to set up a multi region GCP deployment?"},{"tags":["azure","azure-cosmosdb","azure-stream-analytics"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3741,"user_id":1537195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRBvI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1537195/silent"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571050034,"post_id":58373617,"comment_id":103099278,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373617/is-it-possible-to-invoke-cosmos-db-trigger-from-stream-analytics#comment103099278_58373617"},{"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":6787930,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GmVzW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"smontoya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6787930/smontoya"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3741,"user_id":1537195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRBvI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1537195/silent"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571050703,"post_id":58373617,"comment_id":103099626,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373617/is-it-possible-to-invoke-cosmos-db-trigger-from-stream-analytics#comment103099626_58373617"},{"owner":{"reputation":3741,"user_id":1537195,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRBvI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"silent","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1537195/silent"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571050961,"post_id":58373617,"comment_id":103099752,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373617/is-it-possible-to-invoke-cosmos-db-trigger-from-stream-analytics#comment103099752_58373617"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":385,"user_id":11228967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9de91e70fcb1c3f4076a79e5560e8a24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kgalic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11228967/kgalic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":385,"user_id":11228967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9de91e70fcb1c3f4076a79e5560e8a24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kgalic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11228967/kgalic"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571056187,"last_edit_date":1571056187,"creation_date":1571045006,"answer_id":58373730,"question_id":58373617,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58373730","body_markdown":"There is no trigger in ASA for CosmosDb.

Given the grid behavior, `setTiles` should be called during these events:\r\n\r\n- on click of a tile. The clicked tile should be removed from `tiles`.\r\n- on click of the add button. A green tile must be added to `tiles`.\r\n- after a tile decides what it&#39;s color is. The corresponding green value in `tiles` must be changed to red or green.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve prepared a [codepen](https://codepen.io/cephtahrioh/pen/KKKVOwZ) of a simple implementation of the grid detailed above. The issue with this is that calls to `setTiles` after an `await` statement overwrites state changes that happened between the start and end of the asynchronous statement. I think this is because the function only has reference to the state value before starting the async operation.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the best architecture (component changes, callback passing, tile data structure), **using SFCs and the Hooks API**, to avoid the unintended overwrites and, ultimately, the tile grid having an updated array of tile data at all times?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373613/hooks-api-avoid-state-overwrite-when-setting-state-after-await-statement","title":"Hooks API - Avoid state overwrite when setting state after await statement"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83278,"user_id":984421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9J30.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ekhumoro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/984421/ekhumoro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571044972,"post_id":58373612,"comment_id":103096658,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373612/combining-data-contained-in-several-lists#comment103096658_58373612"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8987,"user_id":7752296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7033ea69df1e9dddbee828dc92ac967a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chitown88","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7752296/chitown88"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571047490,"creation_date":1571047490,"answer_id":58374458,"question_id":58373612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58374458","body_markdown":"You could do something like this.\r\nLooks at each column, works out the combinations, then output the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy\r\n    \r\n    a=[1, 5,     6, [10,12,13], 1,   [5,3] ,7]\r\n    b=[3, [1,2], 3,  [5,6],   [1,3], [5,6], 9]\r\n    c=[1, 0 ,    4,  [1,2],     2  ,  8   , 9]\r\n            \r\n    df = pd.DataFrame([a,b,c])\r\n    \r\n    final_df = pd.DataFrame()\r\n    i=0\r\n    for col in df.columns:\r\n        temp_df = pd.DataFrame(df[col])\r\n        get_combo = []\r\n        for idx, row in temp_df.iterrows():\r\n            get_combo.append([row[i]])\r\n            \r\n        combo_list = [list(x) for x in numpy.array(numpy.meshgrid(*get_combo)).T.reshape(-1,len(get_combo))]\r\n        temp_df_alpha = pd.DataFrame(combo_list).T\r\n        i+=1   \r\n        if len(final_df) == 0:\r\n            final_df = temp_df_alpha\r\n        else:\r\n           final_df = pd.concat([final_df, temp_df_alpha], axis=1, sort=False) \r\n           \r\n    \r\n    for idx, row in final_df.iterrows():\r\n        print (row.tolist())\r\n\r\n**Output:**\r\n\r\n    [1, 5, 5, 6, 10, 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 10, 10, 12, 12, 13, 13, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 3, 7]\r\n    [3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, 1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 6, 9]\r\n    [1, 0, 0, 4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373612/combining-data-contained-in-several-lists/58374458#58374458","title":"Combining data contained in several lists"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12213336,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74eb748925be6236cc9cc3f8e8c418cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12213336/nick"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58374458,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571047490,"creation_date":1571044624,"question_id":58373612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373612","body_markdown":"I am working on a personal project in python 3.6. I used pandas to import the data from an excel file in a dataframe and then I extracted data into several lists. \r\n\r\nNow, I will give an example to illustrate exactly what I am trying to achieve.\r\nSo I have let&#39;s say 3 input lists a,b and c(I did insert the index and some  additional white spaces for in lists so it is easier to follow):\r\n\r\n       0  1      2     3        4      5    6  \r\n\r\n    a=[1, 5,     6, [10,12,13], 1,   [5,3] ,7]\r\n\r\n    b=[3, [1,2], 3,  [5,6],   [1,3], [5,6], 9]\r\n\r\n    c=[1, 0 ,    4,  [1,2],     2  ,  8   , 9]\r\n\r\nI am trying to combine the data in order to get all the combinations when in one of the lists there is a list containing multiple elements. So the output needs to be like this:\r\n\r\n       0  1  2  3   4  5  6   7   8   9   10 11    12  13  14  15  16 17 18 19 20 21 22\r\n\r\n    a=[1, 5, 5, 6, 10,10,10, 10, 12, 12, 12, 12,   13, 13, 13, 13, 1, 1, 5, 5, 3, 3, 7]\r\n\r\n    b=[3, 1, 2, 3,  5, 5, 6,  6, 5,  5,  6,  6,    5,   5,  6,  6, 1, 3, 5, 6, 5, 6, 9]\r\n\r\n    c=[1, 0, 0, 4,  1, 2, 1,  2, 1,  2,  1,  2,    1,   2,  1,  2, 2, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 9]\r\n\r\nTo make this more clear:\r\n\r\n From the original lists if we look at index 1 elements: \r\na[1]=5, b[1]=[1,2], c[1]=0. These got transformed to the following values on the 1 and 2 index positions: a[1:3]=[ 5, 5 ]; b[1:3]=[1, 2]; c[1:3]=[ 0, 0]\r\n\r\nThis needs to be applied also to index 3,  4, and 5 in the original input lists in order to obtain something similar to the example output above.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nI want to be able to generalize this to more lists (a,b,c.....n). I have been able to do this for two lists, but in a totally not elegant, definitely not pythonic way. Also I think the code I wrote can&#39;t be generalized to more lists. \r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nI am looking for some help, at least some pointers to some reading material that can help me achieve what I presented above. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373612/combining-data-contained-in-several-lists","title":"Combining data contained in several lists"},{"tags":["visual-studio","visual-studio-2017"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12213434,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBpImct9S4UUM-SSLOMxh_pStCseFkOw3C3WRef=k-s128","display_name":"Metegrity Inc.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12213434/metegrity-inc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571044606,"creation_date":1571044606,"question_id":58373608,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373608","body_markdown":"I would like my Visual studio 2017 to show JS class/methods navigation in `cshtml` files in the same manner as in the casual `js` files.

However, the &quot;Alternate explanation of the problem&quot; concerning how to provide interleaved lists with proper numbering for each list can be addressed using List Styles.\r\n\r\nIn the example shown below, I created two new custom List Styles, entitled &quot;Numbering α&quot; and &quot;Numbering β&quot; (with intentionally distinctive notation after each number). To start, I double-clicked `Numbering α` in the &quot;Styles and Formatting&quot; pane to start an α list.\r\n\r\nTo start a β list, I got the insertion point to a blank line and double-clicked `Numbering β`.\r\n\r\nThen, whenever I wanted to continue a list or switch from one list to the other, I would double-click the appropriate List Style as needed.\r\n\r\n[![Interleaved Number Example][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAlso, if the insertion point is on an item from, say, list α, double-clicking `Numbering β` switches the item to the other list, with any subsequent items in each of the lists renumbered as needed. (Note: if a document has a *very* large quantity of list items, you may need to hit `F9` or select `Tools &gt; Update &gt; Fields` for renumbering to be properly displayed.)\r\n\r\nCreating and customizing new lists is pretty straightforward; you can right-clicked in the empty area of the &quot;Styles and Formatting&quot; pane, select &quot;New...&quot;, and tweak stuff for a new list as needed. For specific info, see the &quot;Creating custom (new) styles&quot; and &quot;Working with list styles&quot; sections of [Writer 6.0 Guide : Chapter 9 - Working with Styles](https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/images/6/6d/WG6009-WorkingWithStyles.pdf).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9qFNz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373579/why-does-continue-numbering-behave-unexpectedly/58398978#58398978","title":"Why does &quot;continue numbering&quot; behave unexpectedly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":864,"user_id":6607497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0a0b03f5bbd44186399f4b0aea38049?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"U.

There is also more features in data than `features_1`.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy expected output would be:\r\n\r\n       index     sequence_id  feature_1 target\r\n    0      3  140366A0464161    false     0\r\n    1      4  140366A0464178    false     0\r\n    2      5  140366A0464189    true      0\r\n\r\n\r\nIn terms of what I&#39;ve tried: I&#39;ve attempted a join based on the `sequence_id` but realise that it&#39;s much more than that as the index isn&#39;t the true in `data`, so this has me stumped! \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n     \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373550/pandas-join-index-with-value-in-column-and-id","title":"Pandas join index with value in column and ID"},{"tags":["javascript","html","autocomplete","textbox"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":5019630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10155693746975506/picture?type=large","display_name":"GBouffard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5019630/gbouffard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571044867,"post_id":58373549,"comment_id":103096597,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373549/is-there-way-to-implement-textbox-autocompletion-like-in-general-commandline#comment103096597_58373549"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7339466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10202559297019921/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ticz &#193;d&#225;m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7339466/ticz-%c3%81d%c3%a1m"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":499,"user_id":5019630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10155693746975506/picture?type=large","display_name":"GBouffard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5019630/gbouffard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571045324,"post_id":58373549,"comment_id":103096869,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373549/is-there-way-to-implement-textbox-autocompletion-like-in-general-commandline#comment103096869_58373549"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7339466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10202559297019921/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ticz &#193;d&#225;m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7339466/ticz-%c3%81d%c3%a1m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7339466,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10202559297019921/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ticz &#193;d&#225;m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7339466/ticz-%c3%81d%c3%a1m"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571044914,"creation_date":1571044376,"last_edit_date":1571044914,"question_id":58373549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373549","body_markdown":"Let me ellaborate a little.\r\nMy work environment we have an inhouse developed html/javasript interface where we can configurate a the behavior of some machines (robots :P )\r\nIn this html page i can give commands to the unit like:\r\n/machineX/robotY/commandxyz\r\nofcourse machine is not always machine(1-3) and robot is not always robot.\r\nCan you reccommend me a solution where I (and the enduser) can type in commands fast as in commandline, simple autocomplate won&#39;t work because we have a lot of commands, and machines.

There is a fix for that too. I have used viewport width(`vw`) for it and then calculate it in the right way that the carousel will fit on full screen.\r\n\r\n**CSS:-**\r\n\r\n    .slider {\r\n        white-space: nowrap !important;\r\n        overflow-x: auto;\r\n        overflow-y: hidden;\r\n        margin: 0;\r\n        padding: 0;\r\n        background-color: #e2e7fe;\r\n        width: calc(100vw);\r\n        position: relative;\r\n        left: 34.5em;\r\n        transform: translateX(-50%);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut please note that my fix will work only in large screens only (`lg`) termed in bootstrap. For medium(`md`), small(`sm`), and extra small(`xs`) screens, you have to calculate by yourself with same calculation I used for `lg`. Just you have to set media query for different resolutions for `left` position.\r\n\r\n**Working Fiddle:-** https://jsfiddle.net/szreLuwn/2/\r\n\r\nHope, it fulfills your requirement.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373543/how-to-display-content-full-width-inside-bootstrap-container/58374090#58374090","title":"How to display content full width inside bootstrap container"}],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":11366858,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pdn_LHbCYE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcC0mDxnF0xZFPgsKb7Y9HEmi16kQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11366858/cristian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":11366858,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-pdn_LHbCYE0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcC0mDxnF0xZFPgsKb7Y9HEmi16kQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11366858/cristian"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58374090,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571047009,"creation_date":1571044353,"last_edit_date":1571044698,"question_id":58373543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373543","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a carousel slider with css, atm works fine on chrome/firefox/IE, it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNow I want the slider displays full on the screen since it&#39;s inside a container, so I added a trick to acomplish that:\r\n\r\n    margin-left:-2000px;\r\n    margin-right:-2000px;\r\n    padding-left:2000px;\r\n    padding-right:2000px;\r\n    background-color: #e2e7fe;\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd ended looking something like that:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThat works fine on chrome, but on firefox and IE can&#39;t fully scroll the content.

The actual underlying wire format for datetime values is *millseconds since epoch*, and that is what Bokeh will automatically convert any and all datetime types into when serializing, sending to, or synchronizing with BokehJS in the browser. In standalone (non-server) cases this is not ever a concern, because the data never &quot;comes back&quot; to a Python process. But it can be suprising in Bokeh server contexts. You will either need to convert the timestamp values back to whatever datetime type you want (there are many), or if you just want to make sure the original values are undisturbed, make a copy beforehand.

Given a date range (May 26-June 31), how do I find \r\nevery appointment that happens throughout this range?\r\n\r\n_Appointment from May 15 to May 25 NOT included_  \r\nAppointment from May 15 to May 29 needs to be included    \r\nAppointment from June 1 to June 3 needs to be included  \r\nAppointment from June 20 to July 5 needs to be included  \r\nAppointment from May 15 to July 15 needs to be included (most difficult part of the problem)  \r\n_Appointment from July 1 to July 4 NOT included_ \r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWe have an appointment model that has a start_time and an end_time. If an appointment occurs on any days during the monthly view, it needs to be loaded into the instance variable (@monthly_appointments) so that the simple_calendar gem can display it on the calendar.\r\n\r\nExample: An appointment from June 1 to June 3 needs to show up when the user views the &quot;June 2020&quot; calendar. An appointment from May 15 to July 15 also needs to show up every single day during June.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s 6-day padding on each side of the calendar dates, since if the week starts on a Saturday (June 1), you&#39;ll have May 26 - May 31 showing on the June calendar (see picture).\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d think it was just as easy as saying &quot;If an appointment starts or ends during the given month, add that appointment to the instance variable. However, there are cases when an appointment starts on May 15 and goes for 60 days, until July 15. The appointment neither starts nor ends during June, but it needs to still show up on the calendar. \r\n\r\nOriginally, we told users, &quot;appointments cannot last longer than 6 months&quot; and then we used this lookup where we assumed, **&quot;if the appointment started during the last 6 months, include it in the variable and then we&#39;ll let the calendar gem work out the rest.&quot;**\r\n\r\n```@monthly_appointments = current_user.appointments.includes(:pet).where(start_time: (Time.zone.now).beginning_of_month - 6.months..(Time.zone.now).end_of_month + 6.days))```\r\n\r\nHowever, this query can sometimes save 3,000+ appointments in the variable, when, in reality, there are only 50-70 appointments that NEED to be shown for that month. \r\n\r\nSo, I wrote up the following code, and it succeeds in finding appointments that occur on at least one day during the calendar&#39;s timeframe. It compares the monthly calendar&#39;s range(May 26..June 31) and an appointment&#39;s range(June 1..June 3), and then looks for any dates that occur in both arrays (&amp;). It works well, but it takes a bit of time because it needs to load ALL the appointments for a user (thousands) and then goes through each one to see if it occurs during that month. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any other clever solutions to this query issue? I&#39;m sure something exists out there, but I haven&#39;t found it yet. Thanks!\r\n\r\n```\r\nmonth_dates = ((Time.zone.now.beginning_of_month - 6.days)..(Time.zone.now.end_of_month + 6.days)).to_a\r\n\r\n@monthly_appointments = current_user.appointments.includes(:pet).select do |appt|\r\n  #create array of appointment dates and see if it intersects any of the monthly date array\r\n  appt_dates = (appt.start_time.to_date..appt.end_time.to_date).to_a\r\n  (month_dates &amp;

Well, not that much.

When I output a Date object with the &quot;.toDate()&quot; method, this object **is always set to 2 hours before the expected time**. But if I use the .toISOString() method, I get the proper time for all the occurrencies. \r\n\r\nI guess that something is wrong with my Date objects, setting them up at a different timezone than the one I have. A couple of examples:\r\n\r\n- For the string `90=&gt;Mon&amp;Tue&amp;Thu=&gt;16:00` I get the Date object:  `2019-10-14T14:00:11.852Z`\r\n- For the string `30=&gt;Mon&amp;Tue&amp;Wed&amp;Thu&amp;Fri&amp;Sat&amp;Sun=&gt;18:30` I get the Date object:  `2019-10-14T16:30:11.866Z`\r\n\r\nI would like to know what&#39;s the explanation for such a behavior, and if I can do something to change it so the normal Javascript Date object points to the same hour than my momentjs object, or the .toISOString() output.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373506/momentjs-and-js-date-objects-not-referring-to-the-same-hour","title":"MomentJS and JS Date objects not referring to the same hour"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","jpa","sql-update"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11490,"user_id":1045142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uz1X3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Martinelli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1045142/simon-martinelli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571044402,"post_id":58373504,"comment_id":103096325,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373504/touch-equivalent-for-hibernate-entity#comment103096325_58373504"},{"owner":{"reputation":2172,"user_id":653539,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rpb9H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom&#225;š Z&#225;lusk&#253;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/653539/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1-z%c3%a1lusk%c3%bd"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11490,"user_id":1045142,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uz1X3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Martinelli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1045142/simon-martinelli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571046291,"post_id":58373504,"comment_id":103097456,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58373504/touch-equivalent-for-hibernate-entity#comment103097456_58373504"}],"owner":{"reputation":2172,"user_id":653539,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rpb9H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom&#225;š Z&#225;lusk&#253;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/653539/tom%c3%a1%c5%a1-z%c3%a1lusk%c3%bd"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571044227,"creation_date":1571044227,"question_id":58373504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58373504","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to implement repository method `void touch(MyEntity myEntity)` which enforces SQL call of update of entity columns to their current values. (The reason behind is the `on update` trigger which needs to be invoked in some point of execution.) Ideal usecase is:\r\n\r\n    void serviceMethod(Long myEntityId) {\r\n        MyEntity myEntity = myEntityRepository.findOne(myEntityId);\r\n        ...\r\n        myEntityRepository.touch(myEntity);\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere are already similar questions on SO which don&#39;t work for me: [Force update in Hibernate][1] (my entity is detached), [Implementing “touch” on JPA entity?][2] (doing some harmless change works but is not general and has bad impact on code readability), [Hibernate Idempotent Update][3] (similar example).\r\n\r\nI am aware of session interceptor method `findDirty` and also `CustomEntityDirtinessStrategy` both described in [this Vlad Mihalcea&#39;s article][4]. However, it seems to use `findDirty` I would have to override session interceptor, which is not possible from within repository method since the interceptor is final field assigned to session at session creation. And `CustomEntityDirtinessStrategy` comes from `SessionFactory` which is global. I rather need some one-shot solution to temporary consider one concrete entity of one concrete class dirty.\r\n\r\nThe so-far-best working solution is to set invalid (array of nulls) entity snapshot into persistence context, so that the subsequent logic in `flush()` evaluates entity as differing from snapshot and enforce update. This works:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    @Transactional\r\n    public void touch(final T entity) {\r\n        SessionImpl session = (SessionImpl)em.getDelegate();\r\n        session.update(entity);\r\n        StatefulPersistenceContext pctx = (StatefulPersistenceContext) session.getPersistenceContext();\r\n        Serializable id = session.getIdentifier(entity);\r\n        EntityPersister persister = session.getEntityPersister(null, entity);\r\n        EntityKey entityKey = session.generateEntityKey(id, persister);\r\n        int length = persister.getPropertyNames().length;\r\n        Field entitySnapshotsByKeyField = FieldUtils.getField(pctx.getClass(), &quot;entitySnapshotsByKey&quot;, true);\r\n        Map&lt;EntityKey,Object&gt; entitySnapshotsByKey = (Map&lt;EntityKey,Object&gt;)ReflectionUtils.getField(entitySnapshotsByKeyField, pctx);\r\n        entitySnapshotsByKey.put(entityKey, new Object[length]);\r\n        session.flush();\r\n        em.refresh(entity);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe advice in [Force update in Hibernate][1] didn&#39;t work for me because `session.evict(entity)` clears `entitySnapshotsByKey` entry at all, which causes subsequent `org.hibernate.event.internal.DefaultFlushEntityEventListener#getDatabaseSnapshot` loads fresh entity from db. The question is 9 years old and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s applicable to current version of Hibernate (mine is 5.2.17).\r\n\r\nI am not satisfied with such hacky solution though.
