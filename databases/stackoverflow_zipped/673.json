This is noticeable on Azure instances because the RDP connection drops. We have seen this with our own filter driver, but we have also reproduced it with the [demo LWF driver from the Windows DDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/master/network/ndis/filter). Not registering the optional callbacks does not have an impact: the network still drops for a moment.\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t happen with Windows Server 2016, and may be related to the QoS feature. A customer of ours had this observation: &quot;Additional observation is that there is some relation to presence of QoS binding on the network interface. When the QoS binding is disabled, the installer finishes without breaking the RDP connection. This scenario however cannot be used as a workaround, since the RDP connection gets broken anyway when QoS binding is restored (re-enabled) after the filter driver is installed.&quot;\r\n\r\nIs this intentional, or is there a way to work around this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381644/installing-ndis-6-lwf-filter-driver-interrupts-networking-in-windows-server-2019","title":"Installing NDIS 6 LWF filter driver interrupts networking in Windows Server 2019 when QoS enabled"},{"tags":["google-data-studio","blending"],"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":9535607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3f49d6a67fb6b31d9723b2bd578f79ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"n.st","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9535607/n-st"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571074734,"creation_date":1571074734,"question_id":58381642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381642","body_markdown":"I have a very simple database model.

I figured out the reason was because the gradle console doesn&#39;t show anything when you just do `print`, only when you do `println`.\r\n\r\nSo then I tried using `println` with the `\\033[F` character which should move the cursor to the beginning of the previous line:\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 20; i++) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;\\033[F&quot; + i + &quot;&quot;);\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            Thread.sleep(500);\r\n        } catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut it also doesn&#39;t work, the console output was\r\n\r\n    0\r\n    1\r\n    2\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nIs there a way to implement a progress bar in the gradle console (with Java code)?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381625/how-to-overwrite-the-previous-line-in-gradle-console-for-implementing-progress","title":"How to overwrite the previous line in gradle console - for implementing progress bar"},{"tags":["gradle","lottie","android-studio-3.5.1"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8310963,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77cd63d4ef7d05dbe83586340483b1b0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"puneetamb240","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8310963/puneetamb240"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571074882,"creation_date":1571074882,"answer_id":58381670,"question_id":58381623,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58381670","body_markdown":"Got it working by changing the code to \r\n\r\n    task androidJavadocs(type: Javadoc) {\r\n      source = android.sourceSets.main.java.srcDirs\r\n      classpath += project.files(android.getBootClasspath()\r\n     .join(File.pathSeparator)) + configurations.implementation\r\n    }\r\n\r\nReference: https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/master/lottie/build.gradle\r\nThe difference is that of configuration.implementation between what is downloaded in lottie&#39;s react native module&#39;s build.gradle and and specified in github link.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381623/android-studio-3-5-1-gradle-error-no-value-has-been-specified-for-property-lott/58381670#58381670","title":"Android-studio 3.5.1 Gradle ERROR: No value has been specified for property lottie-react-native"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8310963,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77cd63d4ef7d05dbe83586340483b1b0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"puneetamb240","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8310963/puneetamb240"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571074882,"creation_date":1571074645,"question_id":58381623,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381623","body_markdown":"Upgraded android studio to 3.5.1.

(I&#39;ve posted my actual formatted code code below, not the description part) Maybe it&#39;s just a fundamental flaw of my understanding of python and list/dictionary comprehension but I was hoping someone could help me out or point me in the right direction before downvoting me or closing the ticket. First let me explain what I&#39;m trying to do:\r\n1. Take the output from Netsh for IP interfaces on Windows and store it.\r\n2. Manipulate the list such that I create a dictionary with keys from the header list.\r\n3. They keys from the header list are going to have values that are another dictionary\r\n4. The nested dictionary should have keys that are netsh description (DHCP Enabled:) and the values split out on the &quot;:&quot;. \r\n\r\neg: {&#39;Configuration for interface &quot;Ethernet 2&quot;&#39;: \r\n        {\r\n            DHCP Enabled: yes, \r\n            InterfaceMetric: 75 ...\r\n        }, \r\n    {Configuration for interface &quot;Local Area Connection* 1&quot;&#39;:\r\n        {\r\n            DHCP Enabled: yes, \r\n            InterfaceMetric: 25, ...\r\n        }, \r\n    }\r\n\r\ninstead, I get:\r\n\r\n    {&#39;DHCP enabled&#39;: [&#39;                         No&#39;], &#39;InterfaceMetric&#39;: [&#39;                      75&#39;], &#39;IP Address&#39;: [&#39;                           127.0.0.1&#39;], &#39;Subnet Prefix&#39;: [&#39;                        127.0.0.0/8 (mask 255.0.0.0)&#39;], &#39;Default Gateway&#39;: [&#39;                      10.1.42.1&#39;], &#39;Gateway Metric&#39;: [&#39;                       0&#39;]}\r\n\r\nHowever when I apply my attempt at dictionary comprehension, I get something that takes the list out of order and then does not iterate through ever item in the list and make proper keys from them. The list has a number of list elements. I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;m going wrong and I apologize in advance if my question is not properly worded of if I&#39;m not coming across clear. \r\n\r\n    from subprocess import check_output\r\n    import pprint\r\n    \r\n    def get_all_network_info():\r\n        s = check_output([&#39;netsh&#39;, &#39;interface&#39;, &#39;ip&#39;, &#39;show&#39;, &#39;address&#39;]).decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\n        s = s.splitlines()\r\n        return s\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def run_parser():\r\n        results = []\r\n        split_results = []\r\n        headers = []\r\n        s = get_all_network_info()\r\n        for i in s:\r\n            results.append(i.strip())\r\n        for j in results:\r\n            if j.find(&quot;Configuration&quot;) != -1:\r\n                headers.append(j)\r\n            elif j != &quot;&quot;:\r\n                split_results.append(j.split(&quot;:&quot;))\r\n    \r\n        # Creating Dictionaries\r\n        ipdict = {item[0]: item[1:] for item in split_results}\r\n        for k, v in ipdict.items():\r\n            for i in v:\r\n                print(k, i.strip())\r\n    \r\n        print(ipdict)\r\n    \r\n    def main():\r\n        run_parser()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        main()\r\n\r\nNow I know that I didn&#39;t actually call an iteration over the headers list. Right now, I&#39;m just trying to get the split_results list to become a proper dictionary.

SFML developers recommend the exact match between your MinGW version and your SFML version - please see [this][1] page, especially these three lines: \r\n\r\n    The compiler versions have to match 100%!\r\n    Here are links to the specific MinGW compiler versions used to build the provided packages:\r\n    TDM 5.1.0 (32-bit), MinGW Builds 7.3.0 (32-bit), MinGW Builds 7.3.0 (64-bit) \r\n\r\nYour MinGW compiler is **8.2.0** - it doesn&#39;t match. So you&#39;ll need to download the MinGW using links from this page and install it manually.\r\n\r\nAlso you try to link with static libraries (with suffix `_s`). In this case you have to add other libraries to the linker setup - please see [here][2]. If to use dynamic libraries then you won&#39;t need any additional libraries, however the SFML directory with its DLLs will need to be added to the **system path**. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE**. Your question has been rewritten many times, so my answer has become irrelevant - this is not good, the question can be updated to improve it, but please not to rewrite it completely following additional information given to you in comments. References to videos and pictures aren&#39;t welcomed here also. Your question must be self-contained and potentially helpful for others, looking for help in similar situations. \r\n\r\nThat said I&#39;ll add two tips for future generations:\r\n\r\n - Don&#39;t use relative paths for `include` and `lib` directories in the NetBeans compiler and linker setup - use only absolute paths.\r\n\r\n - MinGW distributions, referenced on the SFML downloading [page][1], don&#39;t contain the MSYS (small collection of Unix tools, which includes `make.exe`). You&#39;ll need to download and install the MSYS separately, for example using the MinGW installer with `msys-base` package only.  \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/\r\n  [2]: https://www.sfml-dev.org/faq.php#build-link-static","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381614/setting-sfml-up-with-netbeans-in-windows/58385409#58385409","title":"Setting SFML up with NetBeans in Windows"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10638372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48f75835fb947a7a0dacef14c001b16a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"inexperiencecoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10638372/inexperiencecoder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10638372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48f75835fb947a7a0dacef14c001b16a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"inexperiencecoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10638372/inexperiencecoder"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571167687,"creation_date":1571074603,"last_edit_date":1571164311,"question_id":58381614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381614","body_markdown":"Hi I am having problems with trying to get sfml going with netbeans.

Combine that with a Stackdriver logging exclude and the written records need not be written to the actual log and hence apparently not be included in your logging utilization.\r\n\r\nA possible down-side would be that as you pass through Stackdriver, you are likely increasing the path length of writes and hence it may be longer before a write actually makes its way to the final destination.

This file contains the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script type=&#39;text/javascript&#39;&gt;\r\n\r\nvar slideElements\r\n\r\n  function getElementForSlide(slide) {\r\n    slideElements = slideElements || document.querySelectorAll(&#39;.remark-slide&#39;)\r\n    return slideElements[slide.getSlideIndex()]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  slideshow.on(&#39;showSlide&#39;, function (slide) {\r\n    Array.from(getElementForSlide(slide).querySelectorAll(&#39;video, audio&#39;)).forEach(function (vid) {\r\n      vid.loop = false\r\n      vid.currentTime = 0\r\n      vid.play()\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n\r\n  slideshow.on(&#39;hideSlide&#39;, function (slide) {\r\n    Array.from(getElementForSlide(slide).querySelectorAll(&#39;video, audio&#39;)).forEach(function (vid) {\r\n      vid.pause()\r\n    })\r\n  })\r\n\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe YAML also calls on a css file called &#39;my_styles&#39; (also in the same directory as the markdown file), which is used to get the video to play fullscreen. I guess you could include this in a css chunk directly in the markdown, but I wanted to keep it external. The file contains:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#my_video {\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n  min-width: 100%;\r\n  min-height: 100%;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get this to work, note that when I reference a video in the markdown I include `id=&quot;my_video&quot;`.\r\n\r\nThis works for me when the presentation is in fullscreen in Firefox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381602/background-video-in-xaringan-slides/58392029#58392029","title":"Background video in Xaringan slides"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4057750,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-0K3Niu1g9gA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKE/95Mv7xVXaZA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andy Field","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4057750/andy-field"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571133599,"creation_date":1571074573,"question_id":58381602,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381602","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a presentation using Xaringan.

foundByOrderNo = orderRepository.getOrderByOrderNum();\r\n     model.addAttribute(&quot;foundByOrderNo&quot;, foundByOrderNo);\r\n     return &quot;test&quot;;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can successfully query the database and return a result when the query is hard coded with `order_num` value of `12354` like below : \r\n\r\n```\r\n@Repository\r\npublic interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;OrderEntity, OrderID&gt; {\r\n     \r\n     @Query(value =&quot;SELECT * FROM office_products WHERE order_num=12354&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\r\n     List&lt;OrderEntity&gt; getOrderByOrderNum();\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when attempting to use a parameter by passing in a value via `http://localhost:8080/test?orderNum=12354`, like below the code doesn&#39;t work :\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Repository\r\npublic interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;OrderEntity, OrderID&gt; {\r\n     \r\n     @Query(value =&quot;SELECT * FROM office_products WHERE order_num = :orderNum&quot;, nativeQuery = true)\r\n     List&lt;OrderEntity&gt; getOrderByOrderNum();\r\n} \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen attempting to use parameter I get back the following errors : \r\n\r\n@`http://localhost:8080/test?orderNum=12354` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhitelabel Error Page\r\nThis application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.\r\n\r\nMon Oct 14 12:07:44 CDT 2019\r\nThere was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500).\r\nNamed parameter not bound : orderNum;

getOrderByOrderNum();` I get a new error : \r\n\r\n@`http://localhost:8080/test?orderNum=12354` :\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhitelabel Error Page\r\nThis application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.\r\n\r\nMon Oct 14 12:22:11 CDT 2019\r\nThere was an unexpected error (type=Internal Server Error, status=500).\r\nUnresolved compilation problem: The method getOrderByOrderNum(String) in the type OrderRepository  is not applicable for the arguments ()\r\njava.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: \r\n\tThe method getOrderByOrderNum(String) in the type OrderRepository is not applicable for the arguments ()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAny idea what I am missing here?\r\n\r\n\r\n*****************************\r\nUPDATE: \r\n\r\nAfter digging in deeper, I realized I needed to add the following code to my controller and using the JPQL example as suggested by Shabbir the code now works : \r\n```\r\n@GetMapping(&quot;/test&quot;)\r\npublic String getOrderListByNum(Model model, OrderEntity orderEntity) {\r\n     List&lt;OrderEntity&gt; foundByOrderNo = orderRepository.getOrderByOrderNum(orderEntity.getOrderNo());\r\n     model.addAttribute(&quot;foundByOrderNo&quot;, foundByOrderNo);\r\n     return &quot;test&quot;;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nUPDATE : \r\n\r\nAnd of course there is the Derived Query solution : \r\n```\r\n@Repository\r\npublic interface OrderRepository extends JpaRepository&lt;OrderEntity, OrderID&gt; {\r\n     \r\n     List&lt;OrderEntity&gt; findByOrderNo(String orderNo);\r\n} \r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381594/parameter-handling-in-custom-query-spring-data-jpa","title":"Parameter handling in custom query Spring Data JPA"},{"tags":["c","mips"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":94494,"user_id":298225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef102f4ee36e58d09e0b27cd5393a1d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Postpischil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298225/eric-postpischil"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571076782,"post_id":58381590,"comment_id":103112301,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381590/what-is-the-mips-logic-of-this-relatioship-s1-floor-log2-t0#comment103112301_58381590"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11988184,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-M5si0TyRJqU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reZTrnJOH4e6rfUSiD-dzwM9qd5cQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shaun Goh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11988184/shaun-goh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571322108,"post_id":58390451,"comment_id":103210032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381590/what-is-the-mips-logic-of-this-relatioship-s1-floor-log2-t0/58390451#comment103210032_58390451"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":45464,"user_id":1524450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BSzDV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1524450/michael"},"last_editor":{"reputation":45464,"user_id":1524450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BSzDV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1524450/michael"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571134505,"last_edit_date":1571134505,"creation_date":1571128433,"answer_id":58390451,"question_id":58381590,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58390451","body_markdown":"The loop counts the number of successive right-shifts (i.e. divisions by 2) that can be performed on `$t0` without the result being zero.\r\n\r\nThat can also be expressed as finding the (zero-based) position of the leftmost `1`-bit in `$t0`.

It reduces the dimensionality of the data. Assuming the rows are observations and the columns are variables, imagine plotting your rows in 35 dimensions (the columns). Most people have trouble visualizing more than 3 dimensions. Principal components creates a smaller set of axes that explains most the the variation in the data. The axes are Euclidian meaning they are at right angles to one another. Your plot and the result of the `summary(res.pca5)` and `plot(res.pca5)` functions show that the first dimension explains 28% of the variation in the 35 variables. Adding a second dimension gives you almost 38% and three gives you 44%. These new variables are combinations of your original variables, not the original variables. The first two components explain more of the variability than any other combination. \r\n\r\nFor some reason you did not try `res.pca5` as a command (or the equivalent  `print(res.pca5)`) which would show you the coefficients that pca used to create the components from the original variables or `biplot(res.pca5)` which plots the rows and columns in the new two dimensional space.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381567/how-to-display-the-name-of-corresponding-pc-when-using-prcomp-for-pca-in-r/58382243#58382243","title":"how to display the name of corresponding PC when using prcomp for PCA in r"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":11512576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b48ef54108d77acb50f3e5186bced1be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11512576/harry"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571077790,"creation_date":1571074397,"question_id":58381567,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381567","body_markdown":"I use prcomp to run PCA in r.

[JGroups][1]\r\n 2. [Spring Cloud][2]\r\n\r\nI&#39;d argue option 2 is the most ideal for distributing your commands, as it gives you the freedom to choose whichever Spring Cloud Discovery Service implementation you desire. That should give you the handles to work &quot;free of licenses&quot; in that area.\r\n\r\nFor distributing your Events, you can broadly look at two approaches:\r\n\r\n 1. Share the database, aka your `EventStore`, among all instances\r\n 2. Use a event message bus to distribute your event messages\r\n\r\nIf you want instances of your nodes to be able to Event Source the Command Model, you are inclined to use option 1. This is required as Axon Framework requires a dedicated `EventStore` to be able to source the Command Models from history.\r\n\r\nWhen you just want to connect other applications to your Event Stream, option 2 would be a good fit. Again, the framework has two options in this area:\r\n\r\n 1. [AMQP][3]\r\n 2. [Kafka][4]\r\n\r\nThe only thing I&#39;d like to point out on this part additionally, is that the Kafka extension is still in a release candidate state. It is being worked on actively at the moment though.\r\n\r\nAll these extensions and there options should be clearly stated in the [Reference Guide][5], so I&#39;d definitely check this documentation out if you are gonna start an application.\r\n\r\nThere is a sole thing you cannot distributed though, which is the `QueryBus`.\r\nThere is a outstanding [issue][6] to resolve this, for which someone put the effort in to provide a [PR][7]. \r\nAfter seeing how Axon Server Standard edition does it though, he intentionally closed the PR (with the following [comment][8]) as it didn&#39;t seem feasible to him to maintain such a tool at this stage. \r\n\r\nSo, can you use Axon Framework without Axon Server Enterprise? \r\nWell, I think you can. :-)\r\nMind you though, although you&#39;d be winning on not having a license fee if you don&#39;t use Axon Server Enterprise, it doesn&#39;t mean your production is gonna be free.\r\nYou&#39;d be introducing back quite some infrastructure set up and production time to ge this going. \r\n \r\nHope this gives you plenty of feedback @ahoffer!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-jgroups\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-springcloud\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-amqp\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/extension-kafka\r\n  [5]: https://docs.axoniq.io/reference-guide/\r\n  [6]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/issues/613\r\n  [7]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1153\r\n  [8]: https://github.com/AxonFramework/AxonFramework/pull/1153#issuecomment-517174130","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381498/is-it-possible-to-scale-axon-framework-without-axon-server-enterprise/58389697#58389697","title":"Is it possible to scale Axon Framework without Axon Server Enterprise"}],"owner":{"reputation":4349,"user_id":290962,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/599c94001308cbe8e8b6d5e7ff8e9082?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ahoffer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/290962/ahoffer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58389697,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571125753,"creation_date":1571074077,"question_id":58381498,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381498","body_markdown":"Is it possible to scale Axon Framework without Axon Server **Enterprise**?

There is a tradeoff between speed and clarity when you debug your code.

(graph confusion? memory leaks??)\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a basic unfinished code snippet of collecting actions for an env, not sure whether to stick with numpy or not.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@dataclass\r\nclass Action(object):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    Handles actions, action space, and value verification.\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    taken_action: np.array\r\n    raw_action: np.array\r\n    n_possible_values: int\r\n    action_space: gym.Space\r\n\r\n    def __post_init__(self):\r\n        if type(self.taken_action) is not np.array: taken_action = np.array([self.taken_action])\r\n\r\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(&quot;env&quot;, sorted([env.id for env in gym.envs.registry.all()]))\r\ndef test_action_data_structure(env):\r\n    try:\r\n        init_env = gym.make(env)\r\n    except error.DependencyNotInstalled as e:\r\n        print(e)\r\n        return\r\n\r\n    taken_action = init_env.action_space.sample()\r\n    raw_action = np.random.rand(init_env.action_space.n)\r\n    state, reward, done, info = init_env.step(taken_action)\r\n\r\n    action_dataclass = Action(taken_action=taken_action, raw_action=raw_action,\r\n                              n_possible_values=init_env.action_space.n, action_space=init_env.action_space)\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381488/when-not-to-use-tensors","title":"When not to use Tensors"},{"tags":["java","string","integer","operator-keyword"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16089,"user_id":9223839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29dcd6d8b4c4a0720ee253013c91d3ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joakim Danielson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9223839/joakim-danielson"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571074196,"post_id":58381487,"comment_id":103111250,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381487/java-how-to-see-if-string-has-an-integer-in-it#comment103111250_58381487"},{"owner":{"reputation":11354,"user_id":3824919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0HpYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3824919/tom"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571074203,"post_id":58381487,"comment_id":103111254,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381487/java-how-to-see-if-string-has-an-integer-in-it#comment103111254_58381487"},{"owner":{"reputation":1729,"user_id":4762502,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JBluz4YbEjk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKM/0RsG_lxMbLs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gaurav Jeswani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4762502/gaurav-jeswani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571074359,"post_id":58381487,"comment_id":103111318,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381487/java-how-to-see-if-string-has-an-integer-in-it#comment103111318_58381487"},{"owner":{"reputation":563,"user_id":2272431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBGrm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheNeil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2272431/theneil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571077704,"post_id":58381487,"comment_id":103112645,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381487/java-how-to-see-if-string-has-an-integer-in-it#comment103112645_58381487"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":5895970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1031897106833834/picture?type=large","display_name":"George Weekson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5895970/george-weekson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571074778,"creation_date":1571074778,"answer_id":58381652,"question_id":58381487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58381652","body_markdown":"it depends on specific requirements. what if 9 is more then one times in string? what you do in such case? if you are sure that 9 appears once in your ticket price. just you next code. \r\n\r\n    if (yourString.contains(&quot;9&quot;)){\r\n         yourString = yourString.replace(&quot;9&quot;, &quot;5&quot;);\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381487/java-how-to-see-if-string-has-an-integer-in-it/58381652#58381652","title":"Java how to see if String has an integer in it"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12215991,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Tp-7QLduIk4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdnIoRFyjrNBqykKoomPIlzsGlw-A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Milan Toth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12215991/milan-toth"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571166226,"creation_date":1571166226,"answer_id":58401150,"question_id":58381487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58401150","body_markdown":"Just had to put &#39;9&#39; so it looks for a char!

trying to access a `WebElement` on the [website][1] after a previous html element has been clicked. When you load the website you&#39;ll see a grid of objects (which for this question&#39;s context let&#39;s call them cards). If you inspect the page before clicking on anything, you&#39;ll see that under the `body &gt; div.view &gt; section.list.gi` div, there are multiple divs which belong to the class `item.card`. As you can see in my code below, i get the first card object that belongs to that class using the `firstCard` selector. I then call the `.click()` method to simulate the click and wait for a few seconds. After that though, is where i&#39;m having trouble. I want to access the `base` attribute of the selected card which is located inside the `&quot;body &gt; div.overlay &gt; div#cards&quot;+base + &quot; &gt; div.one.card&quot;` div&#39;s tags. After some searching around, i found that the `id` of each card object inside the `div.overlay` (after the user has clicked on the card when the website first loaded) is the string `cards` + the `base` string you see above. Now the `base` string is an attribute of each card object (before clicking on it when the website first loaded) so i retrieve that value and store it in the `String base` field. So when i try to access the &quot;base&quot; attribute of the first card after clicking on it&#39;s icon at the beginning using the `dataSelector` field, i get an error that the element doesn&#39;t exist but the `dataSelector`&#39;s value is `body &gt; div.overlay &gt; div#cards1018031 &gt; div.one.card` which looks fine to me.

have some (actually a lot) of Protractor tests in **TypeScript** and I need to take a screenshot in case of failures - from an `expect`or timeout - and I want to use the image on my [Allure

work - the image is being attached to the wrong spec.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to overriding `jasmine.Spec.prototype.addExpectationResult`, but I&#39;m getting the error: **&quot;Property &#39;Spec&#39; does not exist on type &#39;typeof jasmine&#39;.ts(2339)&quot;**.\r\n\r\nI used a workaround to make that work (and it actually worked) as you can see bellow:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nconst jasmine2 =

addExpectationResult.apply(this, arguments);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nBUT is there any way of overrinding the `addExpectationResult` in a &quot;better&quot; way in **TypeScript**?\r\n\r\nI have in my `package.json` file the following `@types`:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n&quot;devDependencies&quot;: {\r\n  &quot;@types/jasmine&quot;: &quot;^3.4.4&quot;,\r\n  &quot;@types/jasminewd2&quot;:

You expect some things and they should mostly fulfill the expectations you have, but in some exceptional cases your expectations are not met. If you ponder about this, you will realize that since softwares can have different levels, what is an exception on a lower level is not necessarily an exception in higher level and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nThe main mistake you make in organizing your code is that your concern of index bounds is handled on the level of `findRoute` and not on its proper level, that is, in your `checkLeft` and `checkRight` methods. On the level of `findRoute`, you kind of expect to have some edge cases (literally), yet, on the level of `checkLeft` and `checkRight` you need to handle this. As a result, you should move all your concern about bounds into `checkLeft` and `checkRight`. If you see value in handling out of bounds as an exception for logging or any other purpose, then you can have a try-catch on the level of these methods, but you should ensure that they handle it. For example you can modify these methods to be `boolean` and return `true` at the end of the `try` and `false` at the end of the `catch`, `like`\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        //Do some stuff\r\n        return true;\r\n    } catch (Exception e) {\r\n        //Do some stuff\r\n        return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand then you can do something like this:\r\n\r\ncheckRight(area, row, col) || checkLeft(area, row, col);\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t worry: if `checkRight` is `true`, `checkLeft` will not be called.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381435/should-i-be-using-try-catch/58382599#58382599","title":"Should I be using Try/Catch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":8391043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf222454a1c6aa73322b6e344f25fbff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CoderKlipto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8391043/coderklipto"},"last_editor":{"reputation":31351,"user_id":436560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2GESV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lajos Arpad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/436560/lajos-arpad"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571079450,"creation_date":1571073784,"last_edit_date":1571078915,"question_id":58381435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58381435","body_markdown":"I am doing some practice problems and the current problem I am working on involves me constantly checking surrounding values in a 2D array.\r\n\r\nI am wondering what is the best way to go about handling `out of bounds exceptions` for a problem like this. Should I be using `try-catch` blocks for each index I am checking? The catch part would not be utilized in this case since I wouldn&#39;t want to print anything or end the program if an error occurs. This is why I think there may be a better way to handle this.\r\n\r\nThis is some simplified code for the &quot;index checking&quot;\r\n\r\n    private static void findRoute(String[][] area, int currentRow, int currentCol) {\r\n        int row = currentRow;\r\n        int col = currentCol;\r\n\r\n        while(!area[row][col].equals(&quot;D&quot;)) {\r\n            try {\r\n                checkRight(area, row, col);\r\n            } catch(IndexOutOfBoundsException io) {\r\n                //Move on\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n\r\n            try {\r\n                checkLeft(area, row, col);\r\n            } catch(IndexOutOfBoundsException io) {\r\n                //Move on\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, for example, if the first `try-catch block` results in an error, I would want it to move onto the next `try-catch` to check the next value.\r\n\r\nHowever, if there is no error, I want to check the value at the index I was using the `try-catch` block on. But if I put a statement after the try-catch to get the value of `checkRight()`, and the error in the `try-catch` was thrown, then it would just give me an error and the program would crash.\r\n\r\nShould I be handling this in a different way? Is there an easier way to handle this with `if-statements` or something?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381435/should-i-be-using-try-catch","title":"Should I be using Try/Catch?"},{"tags":["c#","wpf"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1030,"user_id":6750581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d4ce77cf710ef819c66b1f37f3491e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6750581/tano"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571074549,"creation_date":1571074549,"answer_id":58381595,"question_id":58381434,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58381595","body_markdown":"I am not familiar with c# but the reason is i guess the loop in the click function.

Can you help to convert the script I have now into script that will work without any password (instead of a password it just need a 6 digital number which is not hashed).  \r\n\r\nI tried check_login, but it did not work.\r\n\r\n         $sql = &quot;SELECT id, email, pin FROM users WHERE email = ?&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        if($stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare($sql)){\r\n            // Bind variables to the prepared statement as parameters\r\n            $stmt-&gt;bind_param(&quot;s&quot;, $param_email);\r\n            \r\n            // Set parameters\r\n            $param_email = $email;\r\n            \r\n            // Attempt to execute the prepared statement\r\n            if($stmt-&gt;execute()){\r\n                // Store result\r\n                $stmt-&gt;store_result();\r\n                \r\n                // Check if username exists, if yes then verify password\r\n                if($stmt-&gt;num_rows == 1){                    \r\n                    // Bind result variables\r\n                    $stmt-&gt;bind_result($id, $username, $numerpin);\r\n                    if($stmt-&gt;fetch()){\r\n                       if($stmt-&gt;num_rows == 1){\r\n                            // Password is correct, so start a new session\r\n                            session_start();\r\n                            \r\n                            // Store data in session variables\r\n                            $_SESSION[&quot;loggedin&quot;] = true;\r\n                            $_SESSION[&quot;id&quot;] = $id;\r\n                            $_SESSION[&quot;email&quot;] = $email;                            \r\n                            \r\n                            // Redirect user to welcome page\r\n                            header(&quot;location: dashboard.php&quot;);\r\n                        } else{\r\n                            // Display an error message if password is not valid\r\n                            $numerpin_err = &quot;The password you entered was not valid.&quot;;\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                } else{\r\n                    // Display an error message if username doesn&#39;t exist\r\n                    $email_err = &quot;No account found with that username.&quot;;\r\n                }\r\n            } else{\r\n                echo &quot;Oops!

Turns out, from the [chat](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/200857/discussion-between-hypnagogia-and-larnu), that the OP is not using 2014, but 2005 (which is completely unsupported and has been for years). As a result the answer using a table type parameter will not work because the functionality does not exist.\r\n\r\nI have left the answer there, however, for future users who have a similar question.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nInstead of using a delimited list, use a table-type parameter\r\n\r\n    CREATE TYPE dbo.PrimaryList AS TABLE (primary_no varchar(20) NOT NULL);\r\n    GO\r\n    \r\n    ALTER PROC dbo.LinkProc @IDs dbo.PrimaryList READONLY AS\r\n    BEGIN\r\n    \r\n        SELECT *\r\n        FROM dbo.link_tb l\r\n             LEFT JOIN @IDs I ON l.primary_no = I.primary_no\r\n        WHERE grp_id = 4\r\n          AND status_cd = &#39;A&#39; \r\n          AND I.primary_no IS NULL;\r\n    \r\n    END;\r\n    GO\r\n\r\nYou can then call the SP as so:\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @IDs dbo.PrimaryList;\r\n    INSERT INTO @IDs\r\n    VALUES(&#39;00000447&#39;),\r\n          (&#39;0000300&#39;),\r\n          (&#39;2900071&#39;),\r\n          (&#39;2900192&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    EXEC dbo.LinkProc @IDs;\r\n\r\n------------\r\n**Edit:**\r\nAs for why what you have isn&#39;t working, it&#39;s because you&#39;re quote wrapping your values. What you&#39;re doing is the equivlent of:\r\n\r\n    EXEC dbo.LinkProc @IDs = &#39;&#39;&#39;00000447&#39;&#39;&#39;;\r\n\r\nThe value of `primary_no` isn&#39;t going to be `&#39;00000447&#39;` it&#39;s just going to be `00000447`. If you *have* to pass a delimited list (which I suggest against, and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your function using a `WHILE`, and if it does you **need** to remove that), then don&#39;t quote the values:\r\n\r\n    EXEC dbo.LinkProc @IDs = &#39;00000447,0000300,2900071,2900192&#39;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58381417/select-from-table-where-ids-are-not-in-list-of-ids/58381473#58381473","title":"Select from table where ids are not in list of ids"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":8853662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2SqAH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hypnagogia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8853662/hypnagogia"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571441706,"creation_date":1571441706,"answer_id":58459282,"question_id":58381417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58459282","body_markdown":"This was the solution to my problem.
