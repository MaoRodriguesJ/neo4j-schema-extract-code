My next best idea is pulling apart the [compression][5] module to figure out how it works.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a better suggestion, or even better know of a working module for this kind of thing?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.keycdn.com/blog/http-preload-vs-http2-push\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware\r\n  [3]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-mung\r\n  [4]: https://github.com/axiomzen/express-interceptor\r\n  [5]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025519/express-response-interception-use-body-to-modify-the-outgoing-headers","title":"Express response interception.

They might look like this:\r\n\r\n**Dataframes:**\r\n```Python\r\nDF-1                              DF-2\r\n---------------------             ---------------------\r\n     ID          Name                  ID          Name\r\n1    56       aaeessa             1    12    H.P paRt 1 \r\n2    98       1o7v9sM             2    76       aa3esza\r\n3   175    HP. part 1             3   762    stakoverfl \r\n4     2     stackover             4     2       lo7v9Sm\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to compute the string similarity (Ex: Jaccard, Levenshtein) between one element with all the others and select the one that has the highest score. Then match the two IDs so I can join the complete Dataframes later. The resulting table should look like this:\r\n\r\n**Result:**\r\n```Python\r\nResult\r\n-----------------\r\n     ID1     ID2\r\n1    56       76\r\n2    98        2\r\n3   175       12\r\n4     2      762\r\n```\r\nThis could be easily achieved using a double for loop, but I&#39;m looking for an elegant (and faster way) to accomplish this, maybe lambdas list comprehension, or some pandas tool. Maybe some combination of `groupby` and `idxmax` for the similarity score but I can&#39;t quite come up with the soltution by myself.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** The DataFrames are of different lenghts, one of the purposes of this function is to determine which elements of the lesser dataframe appear in the greater dataframe and match those, discarding the rest. So in the resulting table should only appear pairs of IDs that match, or pairs of ID1 - NaN (assuming `DF-1` has more rows than `DF-2`).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025517/how-to-link-two-dataframes-based-on-the-string-similarity-of-one-column","title":"How to link two dataframes based on the string similarity of one column"},{"tags":["c","arrays","scope","c-strings","lifetime"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20122,"user_id":3100312,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/486be6e961e6c8a2e4705058600e666f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Ogilvie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3100312/paul-ogilvie"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568971649,"post_id":58025514,"comment_id":102453448,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025514/how-to-return-a-string-from-a-function-while-the-string-is-in-an-array#comment102453448_58025514"},{"owner":{"reputation":20122,"user_id":3100312,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/486be6e961e6c8a2e4705058600e666f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Ogilvie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3100312/paul-ogilvie"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568971686,"post_id":58025514,"comment_id":102453470,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025514/how-to-return-a-string-from-a-function-while-the-string-is-in-an-array#comment102453470_58025514"},{"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":7158025,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bPXYA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mehdigriche","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7158025/mehdigriche"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568972191,"post_id":58025514,"comment_id":102453764,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025514/how-to-return-a-string-from-a-function-while-the-string-is-in-an-array#comment102453764_58025514"},{"owner":{"reputation":10480,"user_id":266487,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/585595b6a24df9b742ebc186788e9a8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"harper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/266487/harper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568975262,"post_id":58025514,"comment_id":102455463,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025514/how-to-return-a-string-from-a-function-while-the-string-is-in-an-array#comment102455463_58025514"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20122,"user_id":3100312,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/486be6e961e6c8a2e4705058600e666f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Ogilvie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3100312/paul-ogilvie"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568971819,"creation_date":1568971819,"answer_id":58025618,"question_id":58025514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58025618","body_markdown":"See my comments.

are two errors in the function.\r\n\r\nThe first one is that arrays in expressions are implicitly converted to pointers to element types of the arrays.\r\n\r\nSo if the function has the return expression\r\n\r\n    return mot_generer;\r\n\r\nwhere `mot_generer` is an array then the function return type should be `char *`.\r\n\r\nThe second error is that the function (correctly declared) returns pointer to a local array with the automatic storage duration that will not be aluve after exiting the function.\r\n\r\nSo either declare the array within the function as having the static storage duration like\r\n\r\n    char * initialisation_mot_a_trouver(){  \r\n    \r\n        static char mot_generer[]=&quot;controle&quot;;  \r\n    \r\n        return mot_generer;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr allocate the array dynamically like\r\n\r\n    char * initialisation_mot_a_trouver()\r\n    {\r\n        const char *literal = &quot;controle&quot;;\r\n    \r\n        char *s = malloc( strlen( literal ) + 1 );\r\n    \r\n        if ( s != NULL ) strcpy( s, literal );\r\n      \r\n        return s;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nA third approach is to pass to the function an already created array in main.\r\n\r\nIn this case the function can look like\r\n\r\n    char * initialisation_mot_a_trouver( char s[], size_t n )\r\n    {\r\n        strncpy( s, &quot;controle&quot;, n );\r\n        s[n -1] = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n\r\n        // or for example\r\n        // fgets( s, n, stdin );\r\n        // s[ strcspn( s, &quot;\\n&quot; ) ] = &#39;\\0&#39;; \r\n   \r\n        return s;\r\n

It has about 1.3 million lines of code.\r\n\r\nAfter upgrading to Delphi 10 Rio, a major problem occured. Where our local function variables used to be initialized with a default value (integer would be 0, boolean would be false), it seems they no longer are. Now all my variables get a random value as they are created, so an integer gets something like 408796 as it&#39;s value.\r\n\r\nI suppose this isn&#39;t an issue with new development, but I am sure you can see the problem in our large code base. We have never manually assigned default values to these variables as it worked fine.\r\nObject variables, however, have always had this problem. All properties get random values, so we have adressed that as we went. But now our program completely breaks, as all counters etc. are starting at high values instead of 0. And running through the entire project to fix this would take months.\r\n\r\nIs there perhaps a compiler option to change this? Seems very backwards that they would have changed this intentionally, as it would be pretty stupid. Why remove functionality that all developers expect? I had actually expected it to go the other way, that object variables would no longer need manual default values, and that they maybe implemented a garbage collector. But is seems Delphi has seriously regressed?\r\n\r\nIf there is some option to fix this, PLEASE let me

were trying all day hard to solve this issue. Finally issue get resolved.\r\n\r\nActually i tried to build/compile the app via Terminal. Then i found that it got struck/freezed while compiling the files from installed 3rd party libraries from pods. The 3rd party library named `SwiftSoup` was making problem. Then i removed that pod, and commented out the code related to that. And tried compiling/building the app again. And It worked successfully this time.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\nI followed @Paul&#39;s Answer, that works without removing pod, keeping same pod and code working. Just need to update settings as described by him. But make sure, that you need to change this setting every time you update your pods.

case is different than the implicitly declared case.  In some sense, =default doesn&#39;t actually give you the default, which is kinda odd.\r\n\r\nConsider the following program:\r\n\r\n    class A\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        A(std::string str)\r\n        {\r\n            m_str = str;\r\n        } \r\n    \r\n        ~A() = default;\r\n    \r\n        A(A const&amp; rhs)\r\n        {\r\n            printf(&quot;Got copied\\n&quot;);\r\n            m_str = rhs.m_str;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        A(A&amp;&amp; rhs)\r\n        {\r\n            printf(&quot;Got moved\\n&quot;);\r\n            m_str = std::move(rhs.m_str);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        std::string m_str;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class B \r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        B(std::string test) : m_a(test)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        ~B() = default;\r\n         \r\n        A m_a;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        B b(&quot;hello world&quot;);\r\n        B b2(std::move(b));\r\n    \r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRunning this program will print &quot;Got copied&quot;, unless you comment out the defaulted ~B() in which case it will print &quot;Got moved&quot;.

you say, the expression `foo and True or False` is just a complicated way of converting the &quot;truthiness&quot; of the value `foo` into an actual boolean:\r\n    \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;foo&#39; and True or False  # non-empty strings are truth-y\r\n    True\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;&#39; and True or False  #&#160;empty strings are false-y\r\n    False\r\n\r\n(You can see the rules for built-in types&#39; truthiness [here](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing).) \r\n\r\nThis is because `and` and `or` return one of their operands, per [the docs](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations):\r\n\r\n&gt; The expression `x and y` first evaluates *x*; if *x* is false, its\r\n&gt; value is returned; otherwise, *y* is evaluated and the resulting value\r\n&gt; is returned.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The expression `x or y` first evaluates *x*; if *x* is true, its value\r\n&gt; is returned; otherwise, *y* is evaluated and the resulting value is\r\n&gt; returned.\r\n\r\nand, as you say, the [operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence) for `and` is higher than `or`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat code is totally redundant, for a number of reasons:\r\n    \r\n 1. Because Python already gives you a built-in way to do that, [`bool`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#bool):\r\n\r\n\r\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(&#39;foo&#39;)\r\n        True\r\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(&#39;&#39;)\r\n        False\r\n\r\n 2. Because `foo` is already a boolean anyway; `!=` is a comparison, and the result of *any* [comparison](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#comparisons) is either `True` or `False`, so any conversion to boolean is redundant.\r\n    \r\n 3. Because in a context like `if foo:`, even if `foo` *wasn&#39;t* already boolean, Python will *automatically* evaluate the truthiness of `foo` rather than only accepting a boolean, so `if foo and True or False:` and `if bool(foo)` are *both* pointless; you can just write `if foo:`.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nAnd no, none of the above points changed between Python 2 and 3. You can check the equivalent links for all of the above in the new version:\r\n\r\n - [Truthiness](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#truth-value-testing)\r\n - [Boolean operations](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#boolean-operations)\r\n - [Operator precedence](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence)\r\n - [`bool`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#bool)\r\n - [Comparisons](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#comparisons)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025361/can-i-really-remove-this-seemingly-redundant-code-without-breaking-things/58042772#58042772","title":"Can I really remove this seemingly redundant code without breaking things?"}],"owner":{"reputation":480,"user_id":9457717,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebb62459e1651d2be2ca826b540fb842?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"meissner_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9457717/meissner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58025434,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569089095,"creation_date":1568970843,"last_edit_date":1569089095,"question_id":58025361,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025361","body_markdown":"I found a snippet in our code base that looks kind of useless to me but I suspect that somebody put it there for a reason that eludes me; so I thought I&#39;d ask around. The part is something like this:\r\n\r\n    someParam = &#39;nope&#39;  # someParam is actually a query result, not a fixed string\r\n    if someParam != &#39;nope&#39; and True or False\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the `and True or False` is doing exactly nothing for the evaluation and can be removed since the first part, the equality check, combined with the `and True` (operator precedence `and` &gt; `or`, IIRC) is the same as the first part:\r\n\r\nIf first part evaluates to True -&gt; True and True -&gt; True\r\n\r\nIf the first part is False -&gt; False and True -&gt; False\r\n\r\nnow those results with the appended `or False`:\r\n\r\nTrue or False -&gt; True\r\n\r\nFalse or False -&gt; False\r\n\r\nSo the result of the condition would not change if I removed the `and True or False`, correct? Or am I missing something here?\r\n\r\nAlso could the behaviour of this change while switching from Python 2 to 3?

Don&#39;t do that; if you&#39;re working with dates, use dates!\r\n\r\nE.g. you can do what you&#39;re after like so:\r\n\r\n    WITH prochains_mois (mnth_dt) AS (SELECT TRUNC(sysdate, &#39;mm&#39;) mnth_dt\r\n                                      FROM   dual\r\n                                      UNION ALL\r\n                                      SELECT add_months(mnth_dt, 1) mnth_dt\r\n                                      FROM   prochains_mois\r\n                                      WHERE add_months(mnth_dt, 1) &lt; add_months(TRUNC(sysdate, &#39;yyyy&#39;), 12))\r\n    SELECT mnth_dt,\r\n           to_char(mnth_dt, &#39;mon&#39;) mois,\r\n           to_char(mnth_dt, &#39;yy&#39;) annee\r\n    FROM   prochains_mois;\r\n\r\n    MNTH_DT     MOIS ANNEE\r\n    ----------- ---- -----\r\n    01/09/2019  sep  19\r\n    01/10/2019  oct  19\r\n    01/11/2019  nov  19\r\n    01/12/2019  dec  19\r\n\r\nN.B. You could simplify the predicate in the recursive sub-factored query to `mnth_dt &lt; add_months(TRUNC(SYSDATE, &#39;yyyy&#39;), 11)`.\r\n\r\nThis works by taking the start date (here, I&#39;ve used `sysdate`) and finding the first of the month (by using the optional second parameter of `TRUNC` to specify the level we&#39;re truncating it to).\r\n\r\nThen we simply add a month to each date until we hit the last month of the start date&#39;s year.\r\n\r\nOnly after you&#39;ve got the dates do you then output the data in the format you require using `to_char`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025343/oracle-cycle-detected-while-executing-recursive-with-query/58025773#58025773","title":"Oracle - Cycle detected while executing recursive &#39;WITH&#39;
