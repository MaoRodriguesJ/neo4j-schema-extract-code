result.\r\n\r\nIn general: Just forget about PHP, and look first at the SOURCE that is send to the browser. This one was easily spotted if you did.\r\n\r\nAnd the problem lies in your PHP code which is not possible to debug without seeing where $count comes from.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nTo clarify:\r\n\r\nThis part:\r\n\r\n    var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([\r\n             [&#39;Task&#39;, &#39;Hours per Day&#39;],\r\n             [&#39;A&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;],\r\n             [&#39;B&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;],\r\n             [&#39;C&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;],\r\n             [&#39;D&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;],\r\n             [&#39;E&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;],\r\n             [&#39;F&#39;,      &lt;?php echo $count; ?&gt;]\r\n           ]);\r\n\r\nAlways has the same $count. And that is all your browser receives because your webbrowser doesn&#39;t know about your PHP or database queries.

It&#39;s an array of dictionaries, and you need to parse each one out individually. \r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve said using `Codable` would alter the &quot;entire scope&quot; of the library, I don&#39;t understand how this is the case.

filed a radar on this for iOS 13 because I have a bilingual Japanese/English app. Some fields are Japanese and some English so obviously it makes sense to present the right keyboard type to the user instead of making them flip back and forth 20 times.\r\n\r\nThere was a workaround for this, and that was that after the UIKit calls &#39;textInputMode&#39;, in the main thread you could do this:\r\n\r\n    // has to be done after the textInputMode method is called\r\n    if #available(iOS 13, *) {\r\n        textField.keyboardType = textField.keyboardType\r\n    } \r\n\r\nThis forces the keyboard to reload after answering with the textInputMode that you wanted. I informed them of the bug, and the workaround to get correct behavior.\r\n\r\nSo in iOS 13.1 the bug was not fixed, however they blocked my workaround.\r\n\r\nNice. I won&#39;t report any bugs to them again. Rather if I find a workaround I will just use it.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like they now are silently disabling this feature. And it is a feature, this is literally the purpose of this method call, to find out what input mode should be presented to the user.\r\n\r\nIt *still works ok* though if you have another language and want to select English.\r\n\r\nSo if my user sets Japanese as the keyboard selection then I can force an English keyboard up. Just not the other way around. Any attempts to get a Japanese input mode end up in an English keyboard.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nThere is another path that you can work around this, but it involves discovery and use of internal API which is not straightforward. You&#39;d have to essentially find the functions used to manage the results of hitting the globe button. If you do that you&#39;re essentially simulating the user&#39;s taps and it has wide ranging effects, that is, the keyboard will be changed for other apps too. So it&#39;s not recommended, 100% it will fail App Store submission. I don&#39;t want to post it because of the results of my last workaround. \r\n\r\nI think it&#39;s not possible to understand Apple very easily. All I know is that:\r\n\r\n 1. the API is not functioning as published\r\n 2. it was reported and they did not fix the bug\r\n 3. since the time of reporting they broke (intentionally or not) the workaround\r\n \r\nSo future workarounds should be hoarded until their intentions are clear and/or they fix this bug (which is what they should do). Simply revoking part of the API without publishing the change is a major bug.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58168017/showing-the-system-emoji-keyboard-by-default-on-ios-13/58211243#58211243","title":"Showing the system Emoji keyboard by default on iOS 13"}],"owner":{"reputation":17789,"user_id":89035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4f34e618ee8b2343f7ece4c1c1ac3aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rjstelling","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/89035/rjstelling"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17789,"user_id":89035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4f34e618ee8b2343f7ece4c1c1ac3aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rjstelling","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/89035/rjstelling"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":407,"favorite_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":9,"answer_count":1,"score":9,"last_activity_date":1570704707,"creation_date":1569846817,"last_edit_date":1570092740,"question_id":58168017,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58168017","body_markdown":"**Alternative titles to aid search**\r\n\r\n- Showing the Emoji keyboard as default for a UIKeyInput object (in iOS 13)\r\n- Force iOS 13 to show the Emoji keyboard\r\n- Setting the `UITextInputMode.primaryLanguage` to emoji\r\n- Programatically set the keyboard to emoji\r\n\r\nPrior to [tag:ios13] returning the `UITextInputMode` with `primaryLanguage` that equaled &quot;emoji&quot; would default to showing the Emoji Keyboard (see image below).\r\n\r\n[![Emoji keyboard screen shot][1]][1]\r\n\r\nExample code for returning the &quot;emoji&quot; `UITextInputMode`.\r\n\r\n```swift\r\n//\r\n//  ViewController.swift\r\n//  Keyboard Info\r\n//\r\n//  Created by Richard Stelling on 30/09/2019.\r\n//  Copyright &#169; 2019 Richard Stelling.

CSS property you need is `position: sticky` means that this element would be in it&#39;s respective `relative` position until you scroll down enough and it reached the top (if you set its `top: 0`) and would then &quot;stick&quot; to the top as if it instantly changed it&#39;s position to `position: fixed`. Enjoy\r\n\r\nThe following code could help you achieve your desired behavior:\r\n```\r\n.sticky-container {\r\n   position: sticky;\r\n   top: 0;\r\n   left: 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it is a container that takes up the entire width then also add `width: 100%` and a certain fixed height in pixels to see the container.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have the element stay in a certain position in default when the user just entered the website you probably would need `position: fixed` instead of sticky.

Open Xcode and click on your project, on the left pane.\r\n 2. Select your target (your app), and navigate to the `Info` tab.\r\n 3. Scroll down to the `URL Types` section and click plus to add a new one.\r\n 4. In `identifier` field enter your app bundle identifier (ex: com.your.app.name)\r\n 5. Keep the role as editor and in the URL schemes add the custom url prefix for your app. (ex: myawesomapp).\r\n\r\nThese steps will register your custom url scheme.\r\n\r\nThe second way of handling deeplinking in the app, is by using `UNIVERSAL LINKS`.\r\nThis is the apple&#39;s suggested way of handling deeplinking. According to apple,\r\n\r\nAdding support for universal links is easy. There are three steps you need to take:\r\n\r\nCreate an `apple-app-site-association` file that contains JSON data about the URLs that your app can handle.\r\n\r\nUpload the apple-app-site-association file to your HTTPS web server.

The thing is, that it doesn&#39;t seem to show up when I create a Zap, I have no error, no information about what is happening. Here is the custom field code \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst options = {\r\n  url: &#39;https://myapiurl&#39;,\r\n  method: &#39;GET&#39;,\r\n  headers: {\r\n    &#39;Accept&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;\r\n  },\r\n  params: {\r\n    &#39;limit&#39;: 0,\r\n    &#39;strict&#39;: 1,\r\n    &#39;attr&#39;: &#39;branchs_id&#39;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nif(bundle.inputData.branch_id.id)\r\n{\r\n  options.params.value = bundle.inputData.branch_id.id;\r\n}\r\n\r\nreturn z.request(options)\r\n  .then((response) =&gt; {\r\n    response.throwForStatus();\r\n    const results = z.JSON.parse(response.content);\r\n\r\n    return results[&#39;locations&#39;];\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nReally basic code, where branch_id is an upper field where I select the branch ID with a dynamic dropdown, filled with a trigger that calls the API, and this part work well. I also checked the branch_id field to &quot;Alters dynamics field&quot;.\r\n\r\nI guess I&#39;m missing something, but I don&#39;t know what, since everyone seems to use Zapier CLI to do something with dynamic / custom fields, and I would prefer not to do that if it&#39;s possible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, according to this [doc](https://platform.zapier.com/docs/input-designer#how-to-add-dynamic-and-custom-fields), if I want those dynamic fields to be in the request, I need to include the whole body.\r\n\r\n&gt;To use the custom fields in your API call, you must switch to Code Mode and make a custom API call that includes body: { ...bundle.inputData } to send every input field, including pre-defined and custom fields, in the body of the API call.\r\n\r\nBut then, what if we have multiple custom fields, they will have the same name on the request ? I don&#39;t really understand the whole part of the docs to be honest.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167986/dynamic-custom-fields-doesnt-show-up-in-zap","title":"Dynamic / Custom fields doesn&#39;t show up in Zap"},{"tags":["postgresql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569846877,"post_id":58167985,"comment_id":102717262,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167985/cannot-drop-db-in-postgres#comment102717262_58167985"},{"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":8162420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W2a-qXcUv6k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/moMUiqWYMNg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pyrejkee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8162420/pyrejkee"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569847839,"post_id":58167985,"comment_id":102717800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167985/cannot-drop-db-in-postgres#comment102717800_58167985"},{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569848444,"post_id":58167985,"comment_id":102718154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167985/cannot-drop-db-in-postgres#comment102718154_58167985"}],"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":8162420,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-W2a-qXcUv6k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/moMUiqWYMNg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pyrejkee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8162420/pyrejkee"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569848582,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569846699,"creation_date":1569846699,"question_id":58167985,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58167985","body_markdown":"I need to remove db.\r\nI perform the following queries:\r\n\r\n    UPDATE pg_database SET datallowconn = &#39;false&#39;

and the # don&#39;t work either.\r\n\r\nHow to use it correctly?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167983/personalize-a-title-square-center-huge-size","title":"Personalize a title: Square + center + Huge size"},{"tags":["c#","concurrency","task","task-parallel-library","continuations"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569847279,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102717469,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102717469_58167982"},{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569847442,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102717565,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102717565_58167982"},{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":6399201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcYFD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Stroeken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6399201/erik-stroeken"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569926447,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102745908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102745908_58167982"},{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569929776,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102747541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102747541_58167982"},{"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":6399201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcYFD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Stroeken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6399201/erik-stroeken"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569938855,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102752803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102752803_58167982"},{"owner":{"reputation":10517,"user_id":1086121,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85d145ca3d7f8490da86055b72f3d859?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"canton7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086121/canton7"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569938904,"post_id":58167982,"comment_id":102752828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167982/tpl-task-continuation-task-is-in-state-faulted-instead-of-canceled-when-cancell#comment102752828_58167982"}],"owner":{"reputation":204,"user_id":6399201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcYFD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erik Stroeken","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6399201/erik-stroeken"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569846692,"creation_date":1569846692,"question_id":58167982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58167982","body_markdown":"When cancelling the following task, the task is not in state Canceled but Faulted:\r\n\r\n        private string ReturnString()\r\n        {\r\n            // throw new OperationCanceledException(_cancellationToken);

For the sake of simplification, I only use one cancellation token to cancel the task itself.\r\nBut, the task has state &quot;Faulted&quot; and not &quot;Canceled&quot;. Is that a bug?

This is on the Pie emulator using SDK 29.0.2.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to directly listen for notifications about platform dark mode?\r\n\r\nNote:  There are a number of reasons why I don&#39;t use the Flutter Theme engine - The app themes are more complex than what Flutter provides and the user is given a preference setting to override the dark mode / normal setting to force the app to go use dark mode or normal mode and even provide dark and normal mode to older versions of android.  However when the user selects &quot;Auto&quot; for dark/normal display mode the app should follow the platform mode, and in fact should switch even if th user does not actually leave the app, such as by just pulling down the shade and setting dark mode on or off.

Or, how can a program that been tested dozens of times, suddenly develop a fault out of thin air? \r\n\r\n        &#39;======================================================================\r\n        Dim WPA() As Variant             &#39;Workbook path for Category Class\r\n        Dim WBA() As Variant             &#39;Workbook name for Category Class\r\n        Dim WSA() As Variant             &#39;Worksheet name for Category Class\r\n        &#39;======================================================================\r\n        Dim WBK() As Workbook\r\n    \r\n        ..........\r\n        Set WBK(S) = Workbooks.Open(WPA(S))\r\n        Workbooks(WBA(S)).Worksheets(WSA(S)).Activate   &#39;Activate Worksheet\r\n        NWS(S) = CheckSheetExists(WSA(S))               &#39;Check for Worksheet\r\n        ..........\r\n    \r\n       Function CheckSheetExists(SheetName) As Boolean\r\n       CheckSheetExists = Evaluate(&quot;ISREF(&#39;&quot; &amp; SheetName &amp; &quot;&#39;!A1)&quot;)\r\n       If CheckSheetExists = False Then\r\n           MsgBox &quot;Worksheet &quot; &amp; SheetName &amp; &quot; does not exist.

Do I need to rewrite the whole business logic to support this weird behaviour somehow or this is apple&#39;s bug?\r\n\r\nAccording to topic here\r\n\r\nhttps://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/117256\r\n\r\nthis is a known bug, but it&#39;s basically November and still no info on fixes. Any suggestions / ideas on workaround it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167889/cllocationmanager-authorizationstatus-returns-alwaysinuse-even-when-authorized","title":"CLLocationManager.authorizationStatus() returns alwaysInUse even when authorizedWhenInUse selected in device settings"},{"tags":["plc","st"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":5392790,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b021dca24b75d0c864e6563f4234e808?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Claus Nielsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5392790/claus-nielsen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569958555,"post_id":58167887,"comment_id":102761821,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167887/is-there-any-tool-or-way-to-obfuscate-structured-text#comment102761821_58167887"},{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":529492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4040265ba354bfaa355c994b0abad72a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ravi Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/529492/ravi-sharma"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":118,"user_id":5392790,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b021dca24b75d0c864e6563f4234e808?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Claus Nielsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5392790/claus-nielsen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570519889,"post_id":58167887,"comment_id":102929322,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167887/is-there-any-tool-or-way-to-obfuscate-structured-text#comment102929322_58167887"},{"owner":{"reputation":482,"user_id":8140625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mB2iE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quirzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8140625/quirzo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571808367,"post_id":58167887,"comment_id":103358387,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167887/is-there-any-tool-or-way-to-obfuscate-structured-text#comment103358387_58167887"}],"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":529492,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4040265ba354bfaa355c994b0abad72a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ravi Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/529492/ravi-sharma"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569846379,"creation_date":1569846379,"question_id":58167887,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58167887","body_markdown":"I am looking for a tool to obfuscate structured text code written for PLC. both paid or opensource. i cannot find anything in google.

Of course, this copy will not reflect changes performed in the MySQL database.\r\n\r\nIf **both** sides of the `JOIN` are linked tables, you can create a linked table with a query and work with it.\r\n```lang-sql\r\nCREATE LINKED TABLE tableName(&#39;&#39;, &#39;jdbc:…&#39;, &#39;user&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, &#39;(SELECT … FROM … JOIN … ON …)&#39;);\r\n```\r\nSuch query will be executed by the MySQL and it should be relatively fast.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167872/h2-create-index-on-linked-table-and-perform-join-on-linked-tables/58168475#58168475","title":"H2 - Create index on linked table and perform JOIN on linked tables"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":10175192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gSfTTKm8MD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qACcODd4yETqPC0wAr8XZJLPKjPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jumpy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10175192/jumpy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":35,"user_id":10175192,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gSfTTKm8MD0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7qACcODd4yETqPC0wAr8XZJLPKjPg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jumpy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10175192/jumpy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569848952,"creation_date":1569846310,"last_edit_date":1569848952,"question_id":58167872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58167872","body_markdown":"I have a MySQL tables ```tableName``` and ```table2``` with indices defined on it.\r\n\r\nI created in my Java application a linked table ```tableName``` with this query:\r\n\r\n```CREATE LINKED TABLE IF NOT EXISTS tableName(&#39;&#39;, &#39;jdbc:mysql://hostName:port/dbName&#39;, &#39;user&#39;, &#39;pass&#39;, &#39;tableName&#39;);```\r\n\r\nThe same query for ```table2```.\r\n\r\nThen I created ```tableSelect``` in H2 database with the query:\r\n\r\n```CREATE TABLE tableSelect AS SELECT * FROM tableName WHERE Sex = &#39;F&#39;```\r\n\r\nNow my Java application create an index if not exist on ```table2``` with this query:\r\n\r\n```CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS DES ON table2(DES);```\r\n\r\nand it gives me an error like this when I click a button to re-run query:\r\n```org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLException: Feature not supported: &quot;LINK&quot;; SQL statement:```\r\n\r\nFurthermore if indicices are defined I perform a ```JOIN``` on indices already defined, but it is too slow.

You can perform thousands if inserts per second if you have your system and your application set up correctly.\r\n\r\nPostgreSQL buffers all your inserts in shared memory and writes them to disk during checkpoints. The only exception is the transaction log (WAL), which by default is to be written to disk for every transaction. This makes sure that every transaction can be recovered in case of a crash.\r\n\r\nThere are two things to consider:\r\n\r\n- Don&#39;t open a new database connection for each request. Pool these sessions somehow. If that is not possible from the application, use something like pgBouncer.\r\n\r\n- If you have many little transactions, then syncing the transaction log to disk will be the bottleneck. There are two ways out:\r\n\r\n  - If you can afford to lose about half a second of committed data in the (unlikely) case of a database or operating system crash, set `synchronous_commit = off`.\r\n\r\n  - If that is not an option, increase `commit_delay` from the default 0 and tune `commit_siblings` for your workload.\r\n\r\n     This will make transactions take slightly longer, but reduced the number of sync requests due to transaction commit while still making sure that no single committed transaction can get lost.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58167871/does-postgresql-have-buffered-write-table-or-plugin-that-can-do-this/58169528#58169528","title":"Does PostgreSQL have buffered write table or plugin that can do this?"}],"owner":{"reputation":369,"user_id":4431340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a8d75ccb68f120a1fb7791fbd5b4520?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dmitry Belyaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4431340/dmitry-belyaev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":369,"user_id":4431340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9a8d75ccb68f120a1fb7791fbd5b4520?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dmitry Belyaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4431340/dmitry-belyaev"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569852152,"creation_date":1569846307,"last_edit_date":1569849172,"question_id":58167871,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58167871","body_markdown":"Am looking for some kind of &quot;buffer&quot; table in memory for lot&#39;s of single write queries.
