However, since the eb&#39;s default `sc` of `config.yml` is `git`, it&#39;s a little difficult to `git add` or `git rm` to include the necessary folders/files every time.\r\n\r\nI know I can change `sc` of `config.yml` to `null` and create `.ebignore` to only include `client/build` so that eb deploy will deploy a zip file with `client/build`. However, this supposedly causes elastic beanstalk to re-install dependencies from `package.json` which causes a delay. Also, I would like to manage everything by just using `git` commands\r\n\r\nSo here are the actual questions I want to ask to the community:\r\n\r\n1. With the current project structure, is there anyway to do `npm run build` under `client` through `nodecommand.config` to have elastic beanstalk make `build` after deployment? I have been trying this but this only created error so far.\r\n2. Is there anyway to make deployment and pushing to bitbucket easier while still using git to manage everything?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

You can override this with a comment in one of the first two lines of the module (`# coding: latin-1`) if you really have to. It only affects string literals (and variable names).\r\n* The `encoding` parameter of `str.encode()` and `bytes.decode()` is UTF-8 too.\r\n* But when you open a file with `open()`, then the default for `encoding` depends on the circumstances (OS, env variables, Python version, build). You can check its value with `locale.getpreferredencoding()`. This default is also used when you read from `sys.stdin` or use `print()`.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;d say it&#39;s okay to rely on the defaults for the first two cases (it&#39;s officially recommended for the first one).\r\nBut the third one is tricky: The IO default is UTF-8 on many systems, so you might *think* that `with open(path) as f:` will always use UTF-8, because it did so during development, but then you port the script to a different server and suddenly it raises UnicodeErrors or produces gibberish.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s often not necessary to deal with encoded strings (ie. `bytes` objects) for processing text.\r\nRather, you make sure to have it decoded when reading and encoded when writing/sending the text.\r\nThis is done automatically for streams created with `open()` (unless you specify binary mode `&#39;rb&#39;`/`&#39;wb&#39;`).\r\nIf you think input/output has to be UTF-8, then you should explicitly specify `encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;` when calling `open()`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091494/if-i-want-to-use-utf-8-encoding-the-default-for-python-do-i-have-to-encode-my/58093562#58093562","title":"If I want to use UTF-8 encoding, the default for python, do I have to encode my string variables to byte variables?"}],"owner":{"reputation":32,"user_id":10302442,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95f9b985cb470ca122d6328159f82dc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"EnriqueC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10302442/enriquec"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58093562,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569397511,"creation_date":1569387941,"question_id":58091494,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58091494","body_markdown":"If I have a string that I want to use in byte form encoded as UTF-8, do I need to encode the variable as a byte variable?

If I write this array to a file with json.dump and then read it with json.load, the strings are recovered just fine, and I get no error, despite never encoding. This indicates to me that if you&#39;re just using UTF-8, you don&#39;t actually need to convert to byte form. Am I wrong? If I&#39;m right, is this bad practice nonetheless?

should not override the run command of the influx DB container, if you overide the `CMD` then you need to start the `influxd` process as well. So better to go with init.db script and populate the script at run time.\r\n\r\n**Initialization Files**\r\n\r\n&gt; If the Docker image finds any files with the extensions `.sh` or\r\n&gt; `.iql` inside of the `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` folder, it will\r\n&gt; execute them. The order they are executed in is determined by the\r\n&gt; shell. This is usually alphabetical order.\r\n\r\n**Manually Initializing the Database**\r\n\r\n&gt; To manually initialize the database and exit, the `/init-influxdb.sh`\r\n&gt; script can be used directly. It takes the same parameters as the\r\n&gt; influxd run command. As an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ docker run --rm \\\r\n      -e INFLUXDB_DB=db0 -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_ENABLED=true \\\r\n      -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_USER=admin -e INFLUXDB_ADMIN_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword \\\r\n      -e INFLUXDB_USER=telegraf -e INFLUXDB_USER_PASSWORD=secretpassword \\\r\n      -v $PWD:/var/lib/influxdb \\\r\n      influxdb /init-influxdb.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you check the entrypoint of [influx DB offical image][1] and you can explore the [database initialization][2] from the offical page.\r\n\r\nSo you need place you script in `.iql` or `.sh` and mount the location in docker-compose.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - &#39;influxdb:/var/lib/influxdb&#39;\r\n      - init.db/init.iql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter to create using [InfluxQL][3], add below line to your script and save as `init.iql`\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE DATABASE &quot;NOAA_water_database&quot;\r\n```\r\nYou need to update Dockerfile as well.\r\n```\r\nFROM influxdb\r\nCOPY init.iql  /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow you can remove the command from CMD and it should create DB\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: &#39;3.2&#39;\r\nservices:\r\n  influxdb:\r\n    build: .\r\n    env_file: configuration.env\r\n    ports:\r\n      -

It would be great if you could provide some actual code just to be specific. \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance.

you have logical triples, you can use a little hack with `iter`, sequence multiplication and `zip` to accomplish your goal:\r\n\r\n    result = []\r\n    for number, _, flag in zip(*[iter(mylist)]*3):\r\n        result.append(number if flag else 0)  # flag is only 1 or 0, so no need to compare it\r\n\r\nThat unpacks the *same* iterator over `mylist` as three arguments to `zip`; since it&#39;s the same iterator, `zip` pulls element 0, 1 and 2 for the first output, then 3, 4 and 5, etc. Your loop then unpacks the three elements to logical names (using `_` for the value you don&#39;t care about).\r\n\r\nA list comprehension could even one-line it to:\r\n\r\n    result = [number if flag else 0 for number, _, flag in zip(*[iter(mylist)]*3)]\r\n\r\nthough that&#39;s getting a little dense, meaning-wise.\r\n\r\nAdvantages to this approach are:\r\n\r\n1. It works with *any* iterable, not just `list`s\r\n2. It&#39;s performant; the input is traversed exactly once, where any slicing solution would traverse it multiple times\r\n3.

So the above list would become:\r\n\r\n```[7, 0, 0, 6, 0, 2]```\r\n\r\nMy initial attempt at doing this is:\r\n```\r\nlist = [7,56,1, 8,0,0, 2,0,0, 6,1,1, 7,2,0, 2,99,1]\r\nnumbers = list[::3]\r\nflags = list[2::3]\r\n\r\nresult = []\r\nfor i,number in enumerate(numbers):\r\n  result.append(number if flags[i] == 1 else 0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but it seems to me that there should be a better way to extract tuples cleanly from a list. Something like:\r\n```\r\nlist = [7,56,1, 8,0,0, 2,0,0, 6,1,1, 7,2,0, 2,99,1]\r\nfor (number, __, flag) in list:\r\n    ...etc\r\n```\r\nBut I don&#39;t seem to be able to do this. \r\n\r\nI could just loop through the entire list:\r\n```\r\nresult = []\r\nfor i in range(0, len(list), 3):\r\n    result.append(list[i] if list[i+2] == 1 else 0)\r\n```\r\nWhich seems smaller and more efficient.\r\n\r\nI am unclear about the best option here. Any advice would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I have accepted the answer by wim:\r\n\r\n```[L[i]*L[i+2] for i in range(0, len(L), 3)]```\r\n\r\nBut want to reiterate that both wims and ShadowRangers responses work. I accepted wim&#39;s answer based on simplicity and clarity (and, to a lesser extent, compatibility with python 2, though ShadowRanger pointed out that zip was in Py2 as well, so this basis is invalid). \r\n\r\nThe answer by ShadowRanger: \r\n\r\n```[number if flag else 0 for number, _, flag in zip(*[iter(mylist)]*3)]```\r\n\r\nalso does exactly what I thought I wanted (providing tuples), but is a little obscure and requires zip. As wim noted, ShadowRanger&#39;s answer would be very well suited to a stream of data rather than a fixed list. \r\n\r\nI would also note that ShadowRanger&#39;s answer adds obscure use of zip() (which will become less obscure with time), but adds clarity by the use of named values for the tuple, so it&#39;s a bit of a win/lose.\r\n\r\nFor those struggling to understand ```zip(*[iter(mylist)]*3)]```, it creates three copies of the one iterator, which are then used to contruct tuples. Because it&#39;s the same iterator, each use advances the iterator, making the tuples exactly as I requested.\r\n\r\nFor both clarity and generality, I am also somewhat inclined to a modified version of the solution from @ShadowRanger:\r\n\r\n```\r\ni = iter(mylist)\r\n[number if flag else 0 for number, _, flag in zip(i, i, i)]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which, to me, seems much less obscure).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091360/subset-of-python-list-based-on-groups-of-elements-of-same-list-pythonically","title":"Subset of python list based on groups of elements of same list, pythonically"},{"tags":["vue.js","cors","axios"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11633736,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Djakm9kbwSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAYM/XO9CJoEXUgM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Neal Matta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11633736/neal-matta"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569387665,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569686806,"creation_date":1569387034,"last_edit_date":1569686806,"question_id":58091358,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58091358","body_markdown":"I am attempting to send a POST request to a Spotify API to refresh my access token.

Could someone review and help me on this or provide some alternate solution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091342/pl-sql-ora-00947-not-enough-values","title":"PL/SQL: ORA-00947: not enough values"},{"tags":["php"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":302,"user_id":12055980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Dy1f.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Au Nguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12055980/au-nguyen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569387224,"post_id":58091341,"comment_id":102575332,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091341/php-patient-referral-form#comment102575332_58091341"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":6317583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6FDLS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roldan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6317583/roldan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569388345,"creation_date":1569388345,"answer_id":58091551,"question_id":58091341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58091551","body_markdown":" **continue** should be used only inside **Loops** or any other structured statement.\r\n[https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.continue.php][1]\r\n\r\nChange your validation:\r\n\r\n    if (!isset($variable) || $variable == &#39;&#39;){\r\n       die(&#39;Variable is empty&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/control-structures.continue.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58091341/php-patient-referral-form/58091551#58091551","title":"PHP patient referral form"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":7096805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ddkna.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bilal Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7096805/bilal-ahmed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66,"user_id":7096805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ddkna.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bilal Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7096805/bilal-ahmed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569394283,"last_edit_date":1569394283,"creation_date":1569393912,"answer_id":58092546,"question_id":58091341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58092546","body_markdown":"You can stop the code flow by just using die or exit methods.\r\nYou can use like this.\r\nDepending on data type which you have to check and i assume that you have string data in variable.\r\nyou can use condition like this.\r\n\r\n    if(empty($variable_name) OR $variable_name = &#39;&#39;){\r\n    exit; //or die;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nContinue statement cannot be used in if conditions because if is a decision making statement.

firstly check [this code sample][1] , which use OpenID Connect to sign in users and use MSAL to get the Microsoft Graph API token to retire groups .\r\n\r\nIf config the your application to receive group claims by editing the manifest :\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      &quot;errorUrl&quot;: null,\r\n      &quot;groupMembershipClaims&quot;: &quot;SecurityGroup&quot;,\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\nThe object id of the security groups the signed in user is member of is returned in the groups claim of the token.\r\n\r\n&gt;If a user is member of more groups than the overage limit (150 for SAML tokens, 200 for JWT tokens), then the Microsoft Identity Platform does not emit the groups claim in the token. Instead, it includes an overage claim in the token that indicates to the application to query the Graph API to retrieve the user’s group membership.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      ...\r\n      &quot;_claim_names&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;groups&quot;: &quot;src1&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n       &quot;_claim_sources&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;src1&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;endpoint&quot;:&quot;[Graph Url to get this user&#39;s group membership from]&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n      ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo you can follow the process :\r\n\r\n&gt;1. Check for the claim _claim_names with one of the values being groups. This indicates overage.\r\n\r\n&gt;2. If found, make a call to the endpoint specified in _claim_sources to fetch user’s groups.\r\n\r\n&gt;3. If none found, look into the groups claim for user’s groups.\r\n\r\nOf course , you can directly call Microsoft Graph API to retire current user&#39;s groups **without** using `group claims` :\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-list-memberof?view=graph-rest-1.0&amp;tabs=http\r\n\r\nYou can then authorize based on that groups .
