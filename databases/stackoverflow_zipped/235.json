It will also insert a log to `Asset Logs` that will duplicate the entry. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve already tried using if statements like `!empty` and `!=` at the same time.\r\nI also tried using if else but I don&#39;t think that would fix it.\r\n\r\nright now I have `if (!empty($assignedHeadset) || $assignedHeadset != $hserial) {`\r\nI tested to query the headset serial from the database and match it to the new or existing serial in the select field. but it doesn&#39;t work\r\n\r\nI use !empty only to insert if the field is fresh.\r\n\r\nI tried to remove the `|| $assignedHeadset != $hserial)` but that will keep insert a log whenever I add a serial or update the comments of the serial. \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: php --&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is where I check the existing `Headset Serial` from the database.\r\n\r\n    //Check Headset ID\r\n    $sql_headset_id = &quot;SELECT id, serial_number FROM asset_inventory WHERE serial_number=&#39;$assignedHeadset&#39;&quot;;\r\n    $result = $conn-&gt;query($sql_headset_id);\r\n    if ($result-&gt;num_rows &gt; 0) {\r\n    \twhile($row = $result-&gt;fetch_assoc()) {\r\n    \t\t$headset_id = $row[&#39;id&#39;];\r\n    \t\t$hserial = $row[&#39;serial_number&#39;];\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd this is where the `$assignedHeadset` coming from. It&#39;s from the `Select Field`. \r\n\r\n    $assignedHeadset = $_POST[&#39;assignedHeadset&#39;];\r\n\r\nAnd this is the code that I am having issues on inserting the asset logs.\r\n\r\n    if (!empty($assignedHeadset) || $assignedHeadset != $hserial) {\r\n        //asset logs\r\n        $sql_log = &quot;INSERT INTO asset_logs (username, inventory_id, claim_status, processed_by, date_processed) VALUES (?,?,?,?,?)&quot;;\r\n        $stmt_log = mysqli_stmt_init($conn);\r\n        if(!mysqli_stmt_prepare($stmt_log, $sql_log)) {\r\n    \t    die (&quot;LOG QUERY FAILED&quot; . mysqli_error($conn));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI expect only to insert a log if the field is empty or the serial is changed.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance I hope you can help me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480241/how-to-insert-value-only-if-the-input-is-blank-or-not-identical","title":"How to insert value only if the input is blank or not identical"},{"tags":["r","return"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11756145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1147705335247779/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hoa Ngoc Quynh Le","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11756145/hoa-ngoc-quynh-le"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571636454,"post_id":58480296,"comment_id":103292623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480239/r-error-non-numeric-argument-to-binary-operator/58480296#comment103292623_58480296"},{"owner":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11756145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1147705335247779/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hoa Ngoc Quynh Le","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11756145/hoa-ngoc-quynh-le"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571636542,"post_id":58480296,"comment_id":103292647,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480239/r-error-non-numeric-argument-to-binary-operator/58480296#comment103292647_58480296"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11756145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1147705335247779/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hoa Ngoc Quynh Le","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11756145/hoa-ngoc-quynh-le"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571636867,"post_id":58480296,"comment_id":103292734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480239/r-error-non-numeric-argument-to-binary-operator/58480296#comment103292734_58480296"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571636512,"last_edit_date":1571636512,"creation_date":1571636059,"answer_id":58480296,"question_id":58480239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58480296","body_markdown":"Use `paste` here:\r\n\r\n    return(paste0(&quot;Of &quot;, class, &quot; class&quot;, rate2, &quot; % of women and children survived and &quot;, rate1, &quot; % of men survived.&quot;))\r\n\r\nUnlike several other programming languages (such as Java, C#, and Python), R does _not_ overload the `+` operator to allow for string concatenation.

The number of workers greatly depends on the type of application and availability/management of resources on the runtime system.\r\n\r\nOf course, when your system has more than 4 cores, you&#39;d want a higher number in order to use more available computing power. But you don&#39;t necessarily want to saturate all cores, depending on what else is running on the system. Especially IO-bound applications won&#39;t necessarily benefit from having too many worker threads. So setting `CRYSTAL_WORKERS=$(nprocs)` is probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\n`CRYSTAL_WORKERS=4` is just a default value, because there needs to be one. It&#39;s a pretty common default because a) it should provide a reasonable improvement over single-threaded execution and b) modern CPUs have typically at least 4 cores.\r\n\r\nWhenever your deploying an application to a runtime system, you need to consider what is an appropriate worker number for this specific environment and configure it accordingly.

Thank you.\r\n\r\nHere is the original code from the book, which is working.\r\nalien_invasion.py\r\n\r\n    import sys, pygame\r\n    \r\n    from settings import Settings\r\n    from ship import Ship\r\n    from bullet import Bullet\r\n    \r\n    class AlienInvasion:\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;Overall class to manage game assests and behavior.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Initialize the game and create game resources.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            pygame.init()\r\n            self.settings = Settings()\r\n    \r\n            self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(\r\n                (self.settings.screen_width, self.settings.screen_height))\r\n            pygame.display.set_caption(&quot;Alien Invasion&quot;)\r\n            \r\n            self.ship = Ship(self)\r\n            self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group()\r\n    \r\n        def run_game(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Start the main loop for the game.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            while True:\r\n                self._check_events()\r\n                self.ship.update()\r\n                self.bullets.update()\r\n                self._update_screen()\r\n                    \r\n        def _check_events(self):\r\n            &quot;&quot;&quot;Respond to keypresses and mouse events.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n            for event in pygame.event.get():\r\n                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\r\n                    sys.exit()\r\n                elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\r\n                    self._check_keydown_events(event)\r\n                elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:\r\n                    self._check_keyup_events(event)\r\n    \r\n        def _check_keydown_events(self, event):\r\n            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\r\n                self.ship.moving_right = True\r\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\r\n                self.ship.moving_left = True\r\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_q:\r\n                sys.exit()\r\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:\r\n                self._fire_bullet()\r\n    \r\n        def _check_keyup_events(self, event):\r\n            if event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:                                    \r\n                self.ship.moving_right = False\r\n            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\r\n                self.ship.moving_left = False\r\n        \r\n        def _fire_bullet(self):\r\n            new_bullet = Bullet(self)\r\n            self.bullets.add(new_bullet)\r\n    \r\n        def _update_screen(self):\r\n            #

You can do this by creating a function/arrow function that returns the props, like this (if you&#39;re using a function to perform the action, make sure to IMPORT the function as well):\r\n\r\n    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; {\r\n     return {\r\n     someAction: () =&gt; dispatch(actionFunction())\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can also dispatch directly the type of action:\r\n\r\n    const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) =&gt; {\r\n     return {\r\n     someAction: () =&gt; dispatch({type: &quot;ACTION_TYPE&quot;})\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand then connect it to the function:\r\n\r\n    export default connect ({}, mapDispatchToProps) (yourComponent);\r\n\r\nYou can see more in the doc

reason is the execution order of the code.\r\n\r\nThe key point is `beforeAll` function is executed before calling `it`, not before calling `sample.sampleTestFunction()`.

I do not think this is doable in old api but luckily you are on new api already ...\r\n\r\n4. if none of above is enough\r\n\r\n You can stack up more frustrums together at a cost of multiple rendering of the same geometry. for more info see:\r\n\r\n - [Is it possible to make realistic n-body solar system simulation in matter of size and mass?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28020934/2521214)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480157/polygon-tearing-in-opengl/58481799#58481799","title":"Polygon tearing in OpenGL"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2282,"user_id":558366,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c9348270fd077842628ea3bf281fc1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bcmpinc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/558366/bcmpinc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571671580,"creation_date":1571671580,"answer_id":58489479,"question_id":58480157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489479","body_markdown":"How do you initialize OpenGL? \r\n\r\n**Are you using GL_BLEND?**\r\nUsing blending is nice to get anti-aliased polygon edges, however it also means your z-buffer gets updated even when a very translucent fragment is drawn. This prevents other opaque fragments with the same z-depth from being drawn, which might be what is causing those holes. You could try disabling `GL_BLEND` to see if the issue goes away.\r\n\r\n**What depth function are you using?** \r\nBy default it is set to `GL_LESS`. You might want to try `glDepthFunc(GL_LEQUAL);` So fragments with the same z-depth will be drawn. However, due to rounding errors this might not solve your problem entirely.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480157/polygon-tearing-in-opengl/58489479#58489479","title":"Polygon tearing in OpenGL"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9455335,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-iLPaidJb9sI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAU0/rOrEV_0FLxU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Prabh Jot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9455335/prabh-jot"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43551,"user_id":44729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyWaU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"genpfault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/44729/genpfault"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58481799,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571671580,"creation_date":1571635149,"last_edit_date":1571662768,"question_id":58480157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58480157","body_markdown":"500x500 grid with 1000 sub Divisions:\r\n\r\n![img][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nJust one question.\r\n\r\nWhy is this happening ?\r\n \r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;sstream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n#define GLEW_STATIC\r\n#include &lt;GL/glew.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;GLFW/glfw3.h&gt;\r\n#include &quot;glm/glm.hpp&quot;\r\n#include &quot;glm/gtc/matrix_transform.hpp&quot;\r\n\r\n#include &quot;GameEngine.hpp&quot;\r\n#include &quot;ShaderProgram.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;Camera.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;Mesh.h&quot;\r\n\r\nconst char *title = &quot;Terrain&quot;;\r\n\r\nGameEngine engine;\r\nOrbitCamera orbitCamera;\r\nfloat gYaw = 0.0f;\r\nfloat gPitch = 1.0f;\r\nfloat gRadius = 200.0f;\r\nconst float MOUSE_SENSTIVITY = 0.25f;\r\n\r\nbool gWireFrame = false;\r\nvoid glfw_onKey(GLFWwindow *window, int key, int scancode, int action, int mode);\r\nvoid glfw_onMouseMove(GLFWwindow *window, double posX, double posY);\r\nvoid glfw_onMouseScroll(GLFWwindow *window, double deltaX, double deltaY);\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    if (!engine.init(1024, 768, title))\r\n    {\r\n        std::cerr &lt;&lt;

And how can I make the scroll work when nzPlacement is at the bottom.\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480128/content-in-drawer-cannot-scroll","title":"Content in drawer cannot scroll"},{"tags":["r","xts","zoo"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":248,"user_id":6719765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/914e1dcd827ba8bc28e52f4996e65912?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"math4everyone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6719765/math4everyone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571670901,"post_id":58482396,"comment_id":103308852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480126/dateformat-in-as-xts-function/58482396#comment103308852_58482396"},{"owner":{"reputation":15312,"user_id":4985176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80528e26faef4f0767c16e4483503c41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"phiver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4985176/phiver"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":248,"user_id":6719765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/914e1dcd827ba8bc28e52f4996e65912?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"math4everyone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6719765/math4everyone"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571676150,"post_id":58482396,"comment_id":103311521,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480126/dateformat-in-as-xts-function/58482396#comment103311521_58482396"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15312,"user_id":4985176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80528e26faef4f0767c16e4483503c41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"phiver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4985176/phiver"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571646142,"creation_date":1571646142,"answer_id":58482396,"question_id":58480126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482396","body_markdown":"You can adjust the index format after you created the xts with the `indexFormat` function.\r\n\r\nIn this case:\r\n\r\n    indexFormat(co2_xts) &lt;- &quot;%B %Y&quot; \r\n\r\nNote that this only changes the display format.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480126/dateformat-in-as-xts-function/58482396#58482396","title":"dateFormat in as.xts function"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9541415,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDG5N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tech Commodities","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9541415/tech-commodities"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571646602,"creation_date":1571646602,"answer_id":58482504,"question_id":58480126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58482504","body_markdown":"Have you thought about the timetk package and saving the tibble?\r\n\r\n    require(timetk)\r\n    co2_tbl &lt;- tk_tbl(co2, start = start(co2), freq = 12)\r\n\r\nThen use the more generic write.csv, or one of the faster methods, e.g. fread::write_csv if a long file:\r\n\r\n    write.csv(co2_tbl, file=&quot;demo.csv&quot;, row.names=FALSE)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480126/dateformat-in-as-xts-function/58482504#58482504","title":"dateFormat in as.xts function"}],"owner":{"reputation":248,"user_id":6719765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/914e1dcd827ba8bc28e52f4996e65912?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"math4everyone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6719765/math4everyone"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58482396,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571646602,"creation_date":1571634846,"question_id":58480126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58480126","body_markdown":"I want to convert the dataset &quot;co2&quot; that comes in R to a CSV.\r\nMy code is the following:\r\n\r\n    require(xts)\r\n    require(zoo)\r\n    co2_xts &lt;- as.xts(co2)\r\n    write.zoo(co2_xts, file=&quot;demo.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;)\r\n\r\nThis works fine.

This is apparently caused because the client libraries and your server expect different lifespans for the connection. Or something. Honestly, I&#39;m not 100% sure on the why, but the solutions below all suggest that&#39;s what is happening.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 different ways to solve this one:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n 1. Disable KeepAlive on your server\r\n\r\n    This will cause new connections to be re-created for each new    request. Depending on the pattern in which you talk to the server   \r\n    this may be inconsequential ... or it may be performance concern.\r\n\r\n 2. Leave KeepAlive ON but make KeepAliveTimeout longer than 30s\r\n\r\n This is\r\n    the opposite tradeoff as #1. It will be faster and if you&#39;re hitting\r\n    the server a lot you may notice it. \r\n    This will however cause your server to build up connections and reduce the number of concurrent users you can support. The performance impact of either choice\r\n    depends somewhat on what server you&#39;re running and you should be\r\n    able to decide with a little googling around for &quot;KeepAlive best\r\n    practices&quot;.\r\n\r\n 3. Detect the error code and immediately retry the same query.\r\n\r\n When you receive this error - check the error code and immediately retry the\r\n    same request. If the error is caused by using a defunct connection, the new query will create a new connection automagically and should work. If the network is genuinely gone the you&#39;ve got bigger problems.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s possible that this error will come from other sources, but I&#39;ve tried all 3 of these approaches and each one solved the issue (obviously with different tradeoffs).\r\n\r\nrefer to : [this post][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25372318/error-domain-nsurlerrordomain-code-1005-the-network-connection-was-lost/25996971#25996971","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480106/the-network-connection-is-lost-only-in-ios-13-1-3-alamofire/58480965#58480965","title":"The network connection is lost only in iOS 13.1.3 (Alamofire)"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":5294561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d910b102646741a0f34e2c72a1dbc61c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iOSLover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5294561/ioslover"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":5294561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d910b102646741a0f34e2c72a1dbc61c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iOSLover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5294561/ioslover"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571639924,"creation_date":1571634660,"last_edit_date":1571637612,"question_id":58480106,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58480106","body_markdown":"My app connects to a localhost API through Alamofire.

It would be safer to test the string message or the class type. I would prefer that the test detect the type rather than the message, as the string message should not be used for control flow, it is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(Objects.equals(\r\n        new IllegalArgumentException(), \r\n        new IllegalArgumentException()));\r\n    // false\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(Objects.equals(\r\n        new IllegalArgumentException().getClass(),\r\n        new IllegalArgumentException().getClass()));\r\n    // true\r\n\r\nSo to mock this I would use matchers:\r\n\r\n    any(IllegalArgumentException.class), eq(Class1.class.getSimpleName())\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n###Issues with your design:\r\n\r\nI&#39;m going to end with an argument against how this code is structured, being that it is not built around dependency injection. Rather than calling the static method `Class2::write`, you could be calling an instance method. \r\n\r\nFor example, create the interface:\r\n\r\n    public interface Writer {\r\n        void write(Exception e, String source);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can now refactor the class to provide two ctors, one that accepts any writer, and one that defaults to `Class2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class Class1 {\r\n        private final Writer writer;\r\n    \r\n        public Class1() {\r\n            this(Class2::write);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public Class1(Writer writer) {\r\n            this.writer = writer;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        protected void execute(String a, String b) {\r\n            try {\r\n                process(a,b);\r\n            }\r\n            catch (Exception E) {\r\n                writer.write(e, Class1.class.getSimpleName());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsing this strategy you can now simply create an instance mock of `Writer`. This avoids having to mock as static method which changes the bytecode of your application, and also make your class more flexible as it can support many different writer implementations now. Anything that is modifying the bytecode of the application should be used very sparingly, such as replacing static method calls, does not truly validate the runtime execution of your code.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the majority of the PowerMockito/PowerMock only help verify code which was not built with testability / flexibility in mind. You shouldn&#39;t need to use anything outside of the Mockito/EasyMock tool-set for well structured code. There are some exceptions but the tool-set should be used very sparingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58480098/arguments-are-different-wanted/58480439#58480439","title":"Argument(s) are different!

couple of ways to set height for your grid.\r\n\r\n1- Set `domLayout: &#39;autoHeight&#39;` on grid property (**It&#39;s a nightmare for large numbers of rows**)\r\n\r\nWhen you&#39;re setting autoHeight you&#39;re able to set min height for your grid but it&#39;s not possible to specify a max height.\r\n\r\n   As described in [it&#39;s documentation](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-width-and-height/#auto-height):\r\n\r\n&gt; When `domLayout=&#39;autoHeight&#39;` then your application should not set height on the grid div, as the div should be allowed flow naturally to fit the grid contents. When auto height is off then your application should set height on the grid div, as the grid will fill the div you provide it.\r\n\r\n&gt; - As you set different numbers of rows into the grid, the grid will resize it&#39;s height to just fit the rows.\r\n&gt; - As the grid height exceeds the height of the browser, you will need to use the browser vertical scroll to view data (or the `iFrames` scroll if you are looking at the example embedded below).\r\n&gt; - The height will also adjust as you filter, to add and remove rows.\r\n&gt; - If you have pinned rows, the grid will size to accommodate the pinned rows.\r\n&gt; - Vertical scrolling will not happen, however horizontal scrolling, including pinned columns, will work as normal.\r\n&gt; - It is possible to move the grid into and out of &#39;full height&#39; mode by using the `api.setDomLayout()` or by changing the bound property `domLayout`.\r\n\r\n\r\n2- Set it in your scripts (**Somehow better than autoheight**):\r\n\r\n    gridOptions.api.setDomLayout(&#39;normal&#39;);\r\n    document.querySelector(&#39;#results&#39;).style.height = &#39;400px&#39;;\r\n\r\n3- If you prefer to use css you can do it using general css rules like below:\r\n\r\n    .ag-theme-balham .ag-cell\r\n    {\r\n        height: 300px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n4- Or, If you like to use grid layout framework you can find it&#39;s example [here](https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-responsiveness/#inside-css-grid-container).\r\n\r\nHere is the final view implemented on your example (I reduced the amount of data to not touch the the edge of SO character limit):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\t$(function() {\r\n\r\n\t  let res =
