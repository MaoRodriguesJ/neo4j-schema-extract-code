This would probably look like this (I have added a ternary operation as an example of how you can show and hide your component):\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n      console.log(this.state.show);\r\n      return this.state.show ? &lt;MyComponent /&gt; : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut if you really want to check if the state changed just after using the `setState` function, for example inside another function (and not `render()`), you will need to call `console.log` inside a callback. This is because state takes some time to update and therefore synchronous code would fail. `setState` takes callback functions as a second parameter. So, you can just re-write like this:\r\n\r\n    this.setState({ show: true }, () =&gt; console.log(&quot;this.state.show: &quot; , this.state.show));\r\n\r\nHope that helped...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175500/react-dynamically-created-state-variable/58175620#58175620","title":"React: Dynamically created state variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7201312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HzEsP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KennyLogin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7201312/kennylogin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":569,"user_id":8138584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aYj08st4R08/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKM/GS-Y-F8B3is/photo.jpg=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Naveen Jain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8138584/naveen-jain"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569885229,"creation_date":1569878865,"last_edit_date":1569885229,"question_id":58175500,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175500","body_markdown":"I tried to run the code below, but I got an `undefined` from the `console.log` statement.

your code could be simplified to something like this:\r\n\r\n    public void SpawnEachEnemy(GameObject Enemy)\r\n    {\r\n        Vector3 futurePosition;\r\n        do\r\n        {\r\n            futurePosition = new Vector2(\r\n                UnityEngine.Random.Range(UpperLeft.transform.position.x, DownRight.transform.position.x),\r\n                UnityEngine.Random.Range(UpperLeft.transform.position.y, DownRight.transform.position.y)\r\n            );\r\n    \r\n        } while (Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll(futurePosition,0.2f).Length &gt;

recommend adding a safety counter to your loop, to avoid an infinite loop if there is no room to be found.\r\n\r\nNow, a lot of things could be wrong:\r\n\r\n* Maybe the `OverlapCircle` and the spawn don&#39;t happen in the same place? While setting the parent won&#39;t modify the world position, I would still set the position after setting the parent. Not the issue here.\r\n\r\n* Maybe the size of the overlap is too small ? Are you sure your enemies are 0.2 units in radius? Consider using `Debug.DrawLine` to draw the radius of the scanned circle.\r\n\r\n* Maybe your enemies are in a layer not in the `DefaultRaycastLayers` ? Try using a much larger circle radius and add a `Debug.Log` whenever `OverlapCircleAll` actually works.\r\n\r\n* There are a few other possible reasons, like disabled colliders, or colliders that are too small, etc. This should however cover most likely mistakes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175470/physics2d-overlapcircleall-not-detecting-other-gameobjects/58176602#58176602","title":"Physics2D.OverlapCircleAll not detecting other gameobjects"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12145353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99647ac83d3c54b0af3847a206586d02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ams1980","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145353/ams1980"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569954836,"post_id":58178733,"comment_id":102760412,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175470/physics2d-overlapcircleall-not-detecting-other-gameobjects/58178733#comment102760412_58178733"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9476,"user_id":1092820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc78da24118b403595f62fa7856e1b6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ruzihm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1092820/ruzihm"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9476,"user_id":1092820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc78da24118b403595f62fa7856e1b6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ruzihm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1092820/ruzihm"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569955270,"last_edit_date":1569955270,"creation_date":1569908923,"answer_id":58178733,"question_id":58175470,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58178733","body_markdown":"Louis Garczynski mentioned a few of the possibilities but one that wasn&#39;t mentioned is that if these are all instantiating in the span of a single frame (a guess based on a comment saying `SpawnEachEnemy` is called in a loop), then you may need to enable `Auto Sync Transforms` under **Physics2D Settings**:\r\n\r\n[![Auto Sync Transforms enabled][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThis [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) when attached to the camera in a new 3D project&#39;s scene should work as you intend with `Auto Sync Transforms` enabled and it will fail to prevent overlaps when it is disabled.

There is not `@SpringBootApplication` anywhere in that project so in the same package as the Tests I added a test configuration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @SpringBootConfiguration\r\n    @EnableAutoConfiguration\r\n    @ComponentScan(&quot;com.to.config&quot;) \r\n    public class LibTestConfiguration {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd it does not work. Same for classes that are `@Service`. They are not in the context. How can I make it behave like a normal Spring boot application without it actually beeing one and load the configs and contexts from the configurations files I need? The default and test profile share most of their properties (for now) and I want them to be loaded like I would start a tomcat.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175467/testing-spring-boot-library-modules","title":"Testing Spring Boot Library Modules"},{"tags":["amazon-redshift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569895765,"post_id":58175466,"comment_id":102734998,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175466/not-able-to-dynamically-truncate-table-in-redshift-stored-procedure#comment102734998_58175466"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":3315294,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1826185881/picture?type=large","display_name":"kushagraagarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3315294/kushagraagarwal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570036878,"post_id":58175466,"comment_id":102790796,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175466/not-able-to-dynamically-truncate-table-in-redshift-stored-procedure#comment102790796_58175466"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":3315294,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1826185881/picture?type=large","display_name":"kushagraagarwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3315294/kushagraagarwal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569949782,"creation_date":1569949782,"answer_id":58189453,"question_id":58175466,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58189453","body_markdown":"It looks like I have found the answer.

it depends on what UI you want to build up.\r\nThere are various panels and, usually, **there is NO need to use absolute position in most cases**.\r\n\r\nUsually, the `Grid` panel is used to create flexible layouts, by adding rows and columns: for example, if you want to create a page with some content and a bottom app bar with buttons on it, you usually create a `Grid` with as many rows as you need for your content controls, plus one for the bottom appbar itself.\r\n\r\nYears ago, I also started building UIs by using absolute position for every element, but then times passes and you start having a flexible mind in order to build flexible layouts.\r\n\r\nSorry to not answer any further, but your question is just TOO broad to give any precise answer.\r\n\r\nBest

observables with [debounceTime()][2], [distinctUntilChanged()][3], and [switchMap()][4] operators can be used to do this optimally.\r\n\r\nThis approach ensures that data isn&#39;t filtered on every key press (waits for given time and groups characters), ignores filtering again when same key is entered immediately, and has other advantages.\r\n\r\nRefer this [Building a Real Time Search in Angular With RxJS][5] post where this is implemented in search.\r\n\r\nHere is an outline of how it can be done.\r\n\r\n**Template:**\r\n\r\n    &lt;input [ngModel]=&quot;filterKey&quot; (ngModelChange)=&quot;onFilterKeyChange($event)&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n**Component:**\r\n\r\n    filterKey: string;\r\n    inputs$ = new Subject&lt;any&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    onFilterKeyChange(key) {\r\n      this.filterKey = key;\r\n      this.inputs$.next({ &#39;filterKey&#39;: this.filterKey });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    inputs$.pipe(\r\n      debounceTime(750), // Waits until there is no new data for given time.\r\n      distinctUntilChanged( // Only allows distinct data to pass through.\r\n        (p, q) =&gt; p.filterKey === q.filterKey\r\n      ),\r\n      switchMap(input =&gt; {\r\n        // Has cancelling effect, ignores previous input when new key is entered.\r\n        \r\n        let key = input.filterKey.trim();\r\n\r\n        // Filter the data.\r\n        let result = this.items.filter(item =&gt; \r\n          item.toLowerCase().includes(key.toLowerCase())\r\n        );\r\n\r\n        return of(result);\r\n      })\r\n      .subscribe((result) =&gt; {\r\n        this.filteredData = result;\r\n      });\r\n\r\nWhen you have thousands of records, it is better to filter them at the backend. In such case, just replace filtering logic in `switchMap()` with an API call.\r\n\r\n    .switchMap((input) =&gt; {\r\n        let key = input.filterKey.trim();        \r\n        return dataService.getFilteredData(key);\r\n    })\r\n\r\nLive demo on StackBlitz: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-filtering-using-rxjs\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com\r\n  [2]: https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/debouncetime.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/filtering/distinctuntilchanged.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.learnrxjs.io/operators/transformation/switchmap.html\r\n  [5]: https://alligator.io/angular/real-time-search-angular-rxjs/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175424/what-event-change-keyup-etc-should-i-choose-to-filter-data-from-an-array-us/58175817#58175817","title":"what event (change, keyup, etc.) should I choose to filter data from an array using an input text using a optimal way"}],"owner":{"reputation":777,"user_id":5357758,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/266d83febb1a6e98f03837ea1ad3c411?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"yavg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5357758/yavg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58175817,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569971515,"creation_date":1569878302,"question_id":58175424,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175424","body_markdown":"\r\nI have a project in which I want to filter data in an array of more than a thousand positions, but for performance reasons I suppose that it is very ineffective to repeat actions key by key (when the user writes letter by letter).

trying to employ `ArrayFormula` to import value from another sheet inside the same workbook, but I can&#39;t find anything that works except `ImportRange`, and that requires the current workbook&#39;s URL which is tedious.\r\n\r\nI have two sheets set up: &quot;Sheet Name1&quot; and &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; (notice the spaces) inside the same workbook.\r\nInside &quot;Sheet Name1&quot; I have a list of people:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   A      B        C\r\n1 Bob   Smith      http://bobsmith.com\r\n2 Sally Buble      http://sallysmelly.com\r\n3 Tom   Shlonsky   http://tomswebsite.com\r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is their first name, last name, and a URL they own\r\n\r\nin &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; I have the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   A      B        C                      D                          E\r\n1 Bob   Smith             =MATCH(B1, &#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!B:B, 0) =CONCAT(&quot;&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C&quot;, D1)\r\n2 Sally Buble      \r\n3 Tom   Shlonsky   \r\n4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like cell C in &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; to also display those websites. HOWEVER, I can&#39;t just make a reference like `=&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C1` because if Sally gets deleted in &quot;Sheet Name1&quot; (i.e. her row is deleted, not cleared but DELETED), then Sally in &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; will display Tom&#39;s website.\r\n\r\nI tried the following formula set:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In cell D1 of &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; I go `=MATCH(B1, &#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!B:B, 0)` which gives me 1\r\n2. In cell E1 of &quot;Sheet Name2&quot; I go `=CONCAT(&quot;&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C&quot;, D1)` which gives me `&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C1`\r\n3. But now when I go `=ArrayFormula(E1)` I get `&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C1` again. While if I go `=ArrayFormula(&#39;Sheet Name1&#39;!C1)` I get the URL I want, `http://bobsmith.com`.\r\n\r\nI know I can use `ImportRange` but that requires the URL of the current workbook and this workbook will be duplicated many times with different people working on it, so I&#39;d like to remove that extra step.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175407/how-can-i-dynamically-import-value-from-the-same-workbook-using-a-formula","title":"How can I dynamically import value from the same

you extract `time` from the variables in `time=f.variables[&#39;time&#39;][:]`, it will lose it&#39;s associated unit (time is just a masked array, as the error says).\r\nWhat you have to feed to `num2date()` is `variables[&#39;time&#39;].units`, e.g.\r\n```python\r\nfrom netCDF4 import date2num, num2date, Dataset\r\nfile = ... # your nc file\r\n\r\nwith Dataset(file) as root:\r\n    time = root.variables[&#39;time&#39;][:]\r\n    dates = num2date(time, root.variables[&#39;time&#39;].units)\r\n    ## directly get UTC hours here:\r\n    # unit_utchours = root.variables[&#39;time&#39;].units.replace(&#39;seconds&#39;, &#39;hours&#39;)\r\n    ## would e.g. be &#39;hours since 2019-08-15 00:00:00&#39;\r\n    # utc_hours = date2num(dates, unit_utchours)\r\n\r\n# check:\r\nprint(dates[0].strftime(&#39;%Y%m%d%H&#39;))\r\n# e.g. prints 2019081516\r\n```\r\n...to get the dates as a number, you could e.g. do\r\n```python\r\nnum_dates = [int(d.strftime(&#39;%Y%m%d%H&#39;)) for d in dates]\r\n# replace int with float if you need floating point numbers etc.\r\n```\r\n...to get the dates in UTC hours, see the commented section in the first code block. Since the dates array contains objects of type [datetime.datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html), you could also do\r\n```\r\nutc_hours = [d.hour+(d.minute/60)+(d.second/3600) for d in dates]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175390/netcdf-dataset-conversion-from-seconds-from-starting-time-to-utc-hours/58180403#58180403","title":"Netcdf dataset conversion from seconds from starting time to utc hours"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12145393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a76222fe9a26576e61e6da4f7635f1f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wam_salley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145393/wam-salley"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1345,"user_id":10197418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/be8Y6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFuppes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10197418/mrfuppes"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58180403,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570039570,"creation_date":1569878088,"last_edit_date":1569919356,"question_id":58175390,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175390","body_markdown":"I am working with a netcdf format code and I need to convert the time from seconds from the starting time (2016-01-01 00:00:00.0) to time in UTC.

haven&#39;t got a complete solution, but maybe you can use this as a starting point: The following gets you the longest common starting sequence for the strings in an array of length 2:\r\n\r\n    var s=[&quot;This is option: one&quot;,&quot;This is option: two&quot;]; \r\n    var same=s.join(&#39;|&#39;).match(/(.*)(.*?)\\|\\1.*/)[1];\r\n    // same=&quot;This is option: &quot;\r\n\r\nIn `same` you will find the longest possible beginning of the two strings in array `s`. I achieve this by using a regular expression with a greedy and a non-greedy wildcard group and forcing the first group to be repeated.\r\n\r\nYou could apply this method on `slice()`-d short arrays of your original sorted input array and monitor whether `same` stays the same for a number of these sub-arrays.

While every async call will be within a `useEffect` construct, is it preferable to have all of them in the Context or is it fine to mix them between the Context and the Components?  An example would be the Add Users modal I&#39;m building right now.  It has a Context, a parent component (AddUsers) and a child component (AddUser).  Within AddUsers there will need to be a call to one endpoint.  Within AddUser there will need to be a call to another endpoint.  When the Submit button is pressed, there will need to be a call to other endpoints; all of the validation and the POST request, I thought best to handle directly within the Context.\r\n - When naming a Context file, is it common to include &quot;Context&quot; in the filename, like &quot;UsersContext&quot; or &quot;SessionContext&quot;, etc.?  We&#39;re wondering about this because inside the `contexts` folder we have `actions` and `reducers` sub-folders.  For `UsersContext`, for example, there is a companion &quot;Users&quot; actions file and a &quot;Users&quot; reducers file in their respective sub-folders.  So we&#39;re wondering if renaming &quot;UsersContext&quot; to just &quot;Users&quot; would make more sense.\r\n - Is there any best practice about using Actions vs. ActionCreators?  Ex. is it best to call `dispatch({type: TOGGLE_MODAL})` or `dispatchToggleModal()` ?\r\n\r\nLots of questions, I know.  The first one is by far the most important!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175373/seeking-best-practices-with-react-context-hooks","title":"Seeking Best Practices with React Context &amp; Hooks"},{"tags":["php","file-upload","podio"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":6449659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b7525491d5260aea5fa8f0a5841db06b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Clint","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6449659/clint"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569878696,"post_id":58175372,"comment_id":102731647,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175372/passing-file-attachment-with-php-post#comment102731647_58175372"},{"owner":{"reputation":368,"user_id":12084800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VIPVMK7G27s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfC_VSYdmXWEjUHm9p951DskCjfDA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084800/eric"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569884593,"post_id":58175372,"comment_id":102733073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175372/passing-file-attachment-with-php-post#comment102733073_58175372"},{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11886289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-liIvm11i87U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAUw/1F4-AujYogY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ancel Designs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11886289/ancel-designs"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":368,"user_id":12084800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VIPVMK7G27s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfC_VSYdmXWEjUHm9p951DskCjfDA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084800/eric"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569938807,"post_id":58175372,"comment_id":102752772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175372/passing-file-attachment-with-php-post#comment102752772_58175372"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":368,"user_id":12084800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VIPVMK7G27s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfC_VSYdmXWEjUHm9p951DskCjfDA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084800/eric"},"last_editor":{"reputation":368,"user_id":12084800,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-VIPVMK7G27s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfC_VSYdmXWEjUHm9p951DskCjfDA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12084800/eric"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570003918,"last_edit_date":1570003918,"creation_date":1569999280,"answer_id":58196541,"question_id":58175372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58196541","body_markdown":"Maybe like this  : you can&#39;t use a local image in your second form, because the file is not stored on the user computer.  &lt;br&gt; but  when you receive the first form : encode the image in base64 and use it in second generated form\r\n1) use  &amp;lt;img src = &quot;data:image/png;base64, xxxxxx&quot; .  to display image&lt;BR&gt;\r\n2) use  a hidden field with value=&quot;xxxxxx...&quot;  to send to 2nd script&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nnote : the picture cannot be changed.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\nyou can add a option (input check box) &quot;choose another file&quot; to allow picking another local file, then the script check if it should handle the first picture\r\n(base 64 encoded) or the new picture, according the &quot;choose another file&quot; check box value\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175372/passing-file-attachment-with-php-post/58196541#58196541","title":"Passing File Attachment with PHP Post"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11143292,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2224813510890915/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kristo Leas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11143292/kristo-leas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570002101,"creation_date":1570002101,"answer_id":58197160,"question_id":58175372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58197160","body_markdown":"change this line \r\n\r\n    &lt;form class=&quot;contact100-form validate-form&quot; action=&quot;/infotech/webforms/tickets/results.php&quot; \r\n     method=&quot;post&quot; name=&quot;it_webform&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nto this \r\n\r\n    &lt;form class=&quot;contact100-form validate-form&quot; action=&quot;/infotech/webforms/tickets/results.php&quot; \r\n    method=&quot;post&quot; name=&quot;it_webform&quot; enctype=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nas Clint pointed out, this needs to be there.

field, so it submits with the other data?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if i need to explain more.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175372/passing-file-attachment-with-php-post","title":"Passing File Attachment with PHP Post"},{"tags":["wordpress-theming"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9706782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Guna Desouza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9706782/guna-desouza"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569877933,"creation_date":1569877933,"question_id":58175364,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175364","body_markdown":"Do anyone know similar word press theme like qualtrics website.\r\n\r\niam trying to find a word press theme similar to this. i have already checked theme forest any on have suggestion.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175364/do-anyone-know-similar-wordpress-theme-like-qualtrics-website","title":"Do anyone know similar wordpress theme like qualtrics website"},{"tags":["angular","docker","nginx","docker-compose"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":252,"user_id":2682019,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f203201a9a32157621a153359f29ffd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jonnathan Q","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2682019/jonnathan-q"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569878131,"post_id":58175363,"comment_id":102731459,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175363/try-to-make-an-http-api-request-through-angular-frontend#comment102731459_58175363"},{"owner":{"reputation":699,"user_id":1486848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ErRuO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShamPooSham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1486848/shampoosham"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569878287,"post_id":58175363,"comment_id":102731515,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175363/try-to-make-an-http-api-request-through-angular-frontend#comment102731515_58175363"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":2421995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad37035668a1cbe041e65c4e77e3293d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chatzich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2421995/chatzich"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569911079,"creation_date":1569911079,"answer_id":58179111,"question_id":58175363,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58179111","body_markdown":"Calling the precise http request like \r\n\r\n      \r\n      client.get(&quot;http//service-rest:8080/api/call&quot;)\r\n\r\n is wrong\r\n\r\nthe right way is to call \r\n\r\n       client.get(&quot;/api/call&quot;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175363/try-to-make-an-http-api-request-through-angular-frontend/58179111#58179111","title":"Try to make an http api request through angular frontend"}],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":2421995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad37035668a1cbe041e65c4e77e3293d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chatzich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2421995/chatzich"},"last_editor":{"reputation":164,"user_id":2421995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad37035668a1cbe041e65c4e77e3293d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chatzich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2421995/chatzich"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569911079,"creation_date":1569877929,"last_edit_date":1569879105,"question_id":58175363,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175363","body_markdown":"I have a rest API container in java/spring and containerize to a docker service.\r\nThe frontend is written in angular and is served through NGINX server.\r\nUnfortunately the call to http://service-rest:8080/api/call fails.\r\nAny ideas on this\r\n\r\n    events {\r\n      worker_connections  4096;

You can use `XPath` and `lxml.etree._Element` calls to get it:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfor series in chart.series:\r\n    ser = series._ser\r\n    x_pts = ser.xpath(&quot;.//c:xVal//c:pt&quot;)\r\n    for pt in x_pts:\r\n        print(&quot;pt.idx == %s&quot;, pt.get(&quot;idx&quot;))\r\n        str_value = pt.xpath(&quot;./c:v&quot;)[0].text\r\n        value = float(str_value)\r\n        print(&quot;value == %s&quot; % value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d need to extend this general approach to also get Y-values, match up into (x, y) pairs based on matching `idx` (don&#39;t rely on document order), probably discarding any that don&#39;t form full sets; I vaguely remember that can happen.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175359/getting-the-x-values-from-xy-scatter-plot-in-python-pptx/58177302#58177302","title":"Getting the x_values from XY Scatter plot in python-pptx"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12145337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-M6kbY4jzG-s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdzT4Rcg8gAXud1TUaknn1QJ5L9jw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"stevo8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145337/stevo8"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570240927,"creation_date":1570240927,"answer_id":58244796,"question_id":58175359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58244796","body_markdown":"I wanted to post the final code I have base on the answer from @scanny.\r\nMy goal with this was to be able to loop through Power Point slides and extract data from XY Scatter plots that no longer had the linked excel sheet. \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom pptx import Presentation\r\nfrom pptx.chart.series import XySeries\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ndef get_chart_data(prs):\r\n    for sld in prs.slides:\r\n        for shape in sld.shapes:\r\n            if shape.has_chart:\r\n                chart = shape.chart\r\n                series_data = {}\r\n                series_data[shape.name] = {}\r\n                if isinstance(chart.series[0], XySeries): #check if XY Series\r\n                    for series in chart.series:\r\n                        x_values, y_values = read_xy(series)\r\n\r\n                        #create dictionary with Chart name and series names\r\n                        series_data[shape.name][series.name] = np.array([x_values, y_values])\r\n                    for c in series_data.keys(): #get chart keys\r\n                        for s in series_data[c].keys(): # get series keys\r\n                            data_final = series_data[c][s].T #retrieve XY data for given chart and series\r\n                            np.savetxt(f&#39;{shape.name}_{s}.csv&#39;, data_final, delimiter=&#39;,&#39;)\r\n\r\ndef read_xy(series):\r\n    xVal = {}\r\n    yVal = {}\r\n    ser = series._ser\r\n    x_pts = ser.xpath(&quot;.//c:xVal//c:pt&quot;) # get all xVals from xml with xpath query\r\n    y_pts = ser.xpath(&quot;.//c:yVal//c:pt&quot;) # get all yVals from xml with xpath query\r\n    for i in range(len(x_pts)): #loop through all xVals\r\n        x_value = get_pt_val(x_pts[i]) #call function to get each x value\r\n        y_value = get_pt_val(y_pts[i]) #call function to get each y value\r\n        xVal[x_pts[i].idx] = x_value #store x value in dictionary\r\n        yVal[y_pts[i].idx] = y_value # store y value in dictionary\r\n\r\n    # in case x &amp;

I do want to mention before proceeding that @Tom Faltesek raises a good point.  If you have any control over the HTML code, it would be best to approach this with more semantically accurate markup.  If, for example, you had the freedom to arrange it this way...\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;article class=&quot;book&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;book__info&quot;&gt;(...)&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;book__thumbnail&quot;&gt;(...)&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/article&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n...then your CSS could be done in this way:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.book {\r\n  font-size: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.book__info,\r\n.book__thumbnail {\r\n  display: inline-block;\r\n  font-size: 1rem;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.book__info {\r\n  width: 75%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.book__thumbnail {\r\n  width: 25%;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExplanation: Inline-block elements naturally follow each other because they are like block elements that display inline with the text.  That in mind, setting `font-size: 0;` on the parent avoids the natural text space that would normally appear between the elements, so that 25% + 75% only spans 100% of the width without extra text spaces between.  Remember to reset your font-size on the inner elements with this trick, though.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the way that you are asking this question, I assume you may not have control over this HTML structure.  @Gildas.Tambo &#39;s answer will work, visually, but there are challenges that come with floats.  The main issue is that float removes an element from the document&#39;s flow, so it does not contribute to the height of it&#39;s parent.  That means the parent has the potential to be 0 pixels high even if its contents are 500+ pixels high.  This can cause all sorts of weird buggy layout issues when you get into more involved css.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a good use case for CSS Grid.  At this point, [pretty much all the major browsers support it](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid), and it&#39;s a hell of a good weapon to have in your arsenal.\r\n\r\nHave a look at the code below.  Use `grid-template-areas` to quite literally mock up your layout in the form of words to correspond with elements (in this case, each of your `&lt;li&gt;`s) and you can span across multiple rows with one element by assigning it to the entire grid area.  In the example below, I provided 5 rows and marked the left column as &quot;info&quot; and the right column as &quot;thumbnail&quot;, and then to take up all the available space for thumbnail, I just assign `.bookcover` to it with `grid-area: thumbnail;`.  Don&#39;t worry too much about the fancy stuff I did with `grid-template-rows`, [but know that you can use that property to distribute the height of each row](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-template-rows).\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ul, li {\r\n      list-style: none;\r\n      padding: 0;\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .book ul {\r\n      display: grid;\r\n      grid-template-areas:\r\n        &quot;info thumbnail&quot;\r\n        &quot;info thumbnail&quot;\r\n        &quot;info thumbnail&quot;\r\n        &quot;info thumbnail&quot;\r\n        &quot;info thumbnail&quot;;\r\n      grid-template-rows: repeat(4, auto) 1fr;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .bookcover {\r\n      grid-area: thumbnail;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;li class=&quot;book&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;ul&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;bookcover&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1118008189&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;https://books.google.com/books/content?id=aGjaBTbT0o0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;img=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;edge=curl&amp;source=gbs_api&quot;\r\n                 alt=&quot;Book Cover for HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites&quot;/&gt;\r\n          &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;Jon Duckett&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;a href=&quot;https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1118008189&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;HTML and CSS: Design and Build Websites&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;publisher&quot;&gt;John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;November 2011&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;li class=&quot;isbn&quot;&gt;ISBN:  1118008189&lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175352/how-to-align-unordered-list-elements-with-css/58175844#58175844","title":"How to align unordered list elements with CSS?"}],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":11897233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QwTkNacKzlY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGk/IMAwxQT52Q0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Van Gran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11897233/van-gran"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58175422,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569882141,"creation_date":1569877861,"question_id":58175352,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175352","body_markdown":"I would like to build a sample &quot;webshop&quot; project where I would like to list books as on the picture.

On my `User` class I&#39;m using the `@validates` decorator on several attrs, including `team_id`. \r\n```\r\nclass User(Base, UserMixin, db.Model):\r\n    __tablename__ = &#39;users&#39;\r\n\r\n    @validates(&#39;team_id&#39;)\r\n    def validate_team_id(self, key, value):\r\n        assert Team.query.get(value), &quot;invalid &#39;team_id&#39;&quot;\r\n        return value\r\n```\r\nThere is of course a teams table and Team class as well. So far so good.\r\n\r\nI can delete a team:\r\n```\r\nfoo = Team.query.filter(teamname=&#39;foo&#39;).first()\r\ndb.session.delete(foo)\r\n```\r\nBut when I try to commit OR to query anything related to Team:\r\n```\r\nbar = Team.query.filter(teamname=&#39;bar&#39;).first()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis exception occurs: `TypeError: object of type &#39;NoneType&#39; has no len()` See the partial traceback below.\r\n\r\nI put `import pdb; pdb.set_trace()` inside of `validate_team_id`, so I know that it is only being called on the second query and that `value` is indeed a NoneType, but **why is it being called at all?** Commenting out the `validate_team_id` eliminates this behavior.\r\n\r\nPartial traceback:\r\n```\r\n~/miniconda3/envs/my_env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sqlalchemy/orm/util.py in

only supports: strings, numbers, booleans, null and arrays and plain objects with those as values/properties. That&#39;s it. So, no other type of object that is comprised of anything more than that is directly supported by JSON. \r\n\r\nYou have to either manually convert your object to something that can be represented with these basic types in JSON or find some other way to represent your object. The data within an object like a Map with simple values/indexes could be manually put into JSON form (perhaps in an array of objects or an array of arrays), but converting it back into a Map when deserialized will have to be done manually. \r\n\r\nYou can see the types that JSON supports here: https://www.json.org/\r\n\r\nThis means that no custom object type, even if its instance data is only composed of the above types will deserialize into the proper object type.  This would include even something like a `Date` or a `Regex` and certainly includes any non-plain object such as `Set`, or `Map`.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to manually convert your data into something that is JSON serializable and then manually deserialize into the appropriate object.  For example, you could serialize a non-nested `Map` and `Set` that only contains legal keys and values like this:\r\n\r\n    function serialize(mapOrSet) {\r\n        if (mapOrSet instanceof Map) {\r\n             // convert Map into 2D array\r\n             // [[key1, val1], [key2, val2], ....]\r\n             let data = [];\r\n             for (const [key, value] of mapOrSet) {\r\n                 data.push([key, value]);\r\n             }\r\n             return JSON.stringify({\r\n                 _customType: &quot;Map&quot;,\r\n                 _data: data\r\n             });\r\n        } else if (mapOrSet instanceof Set) {\r\n             return JSON.stringify({\r\n                 _customType: &quot;Set&quot;,\r\n                 _data: Array.from(mapOrSet);\r\n             }); \r\n        } else {\r\n             throw new TypeError(&quot;argument to serialize() must be Map or Set&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen, you&#39;d have to have a custom deserializer that could detect objects with the `_customType` property on them and call an appropriate deserializer function to convert the plain JSON into the appropriate custom object types.  You could even make the system extensible by having objects support their own serializing and deserializing functions, using some sort of `_customType` property to identify the appropriate class name to invoke.  Of course, both source and destination would have to have the appropriate serialize and deserialize extensions present to make it work properly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175334/besides-set-and-map-what-other-common-js-classes-do-not-play-nice-with-json-str/58176330#58176330","title":"Besides Set and Map, what other common JS classes do not play nice with JSON.stringify()?"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11810894"},"comment_count":24,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569885880,"creation_date":1569877765,"last_edit_date":1569877985,"question_id":58175334,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175334","body_markdown":"When we call JSON.stringify on a Map or Set, we get empty data:\r\n\r\n    console.log(JSON.stringify({foo: new Map([[1,2], [3,4]])}));\r\n\r\nwe just get:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;foo&quot;:{}}\r\n\r\nI can more or less fix the above by using:\r\n\r\n    console.log(JSON.stringify({foo: Array.from(new Map([[1,2], [3,4]]))}));\r\n\r\n*but my question is* - are there any other core JS classes that don&#39;t get serialized automatically, besides Map and Set?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175334/besides-set-and-map-what-other-common-js-classes-do-not-play-nice-with-json-str","title":"Besides Set and Map, what other common JS classes do not play nice with JSON.stringify()?"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":28336,"user_id":74015,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b7088749adc3ec3e51982d0a3bf1b34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sam Axe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/74015/sam-axe"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569878102,"post_id":58175332,"comment_id":102731446,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175332/when-a-form-is-clicked-show-a-string#comment102731446_58175332"},{"owner":{"reputation":20474,"user_id":1586174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4aa4d9e7b30a8bddace165e4c33abd85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Taplar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1586174/taplar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569878228,"post_id":58175332,"comment_id":102731489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175332/when-a-form-is-clicked-show-a-string#comment102731489_58175332"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":136042,"user_id":383904,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qCWYU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roko C.

so you have a number of problems. As the comments suggest you are not calling the actual mail() function at all currently.\r\n\r\nThe mail() function takes a number of arguments and can have a number of issues with mail actually getting delivered if not constructed correctly.\r\n\r\nThis line:\r\n\r\n     $mml($_POST[&#39;email&#39;],&#39;Reset Password&#39;,$msg,$headers);\r\n\r\nShould be:\r\n\r\n     $mnl = mail($_POST[&#39;email&#39;],&#39;Reset Password&#39;,$msg,$headers);\r\n\r\nThis will mean you will get a boolean of true/false if the FUNCTION succeded. (This does not necessarily mean your mail will get where it needs to go...) To ensure you&#39;re mail is actually going to get where it is intended you need to make sure your headers are all constructed correctly and on top of this that your DNS records are configured correctly (DKIM, SPF etc.)\r\n\r\nConsider the following code snippet:\r\n \r\n        $hostname \t\t= &quot;yourhostname.org&quot;;\r\n\t    $date \t\t\t= date(&#39;r&#39;, time());\r\n        $nameto     \t= &quot;Mr. Target&quot;;\r\n\t    $recipient      = &quot;target@targetdomain.com&quot;;\r\n        $from \t\t\t= &quot;origin_address@yourdomain.net&quot;;\r\n\t    $namefrom \t\t= &quot;Mr. Sender&quot;;\r\n    \t$subject\t\t= &quot;Password Reset Thingy&quot;;\r\n        \r\n        $headers = [];\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;MIME-Version: 1.0&quot;;\r\n\t\t//\t$headers[] = &quot;Content-type: text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;From: $namefrom &lt;$from&gt;&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Sender: $namefrom &lt;$from&gt;&quot;;\r\n\t\t//\t$headers[] = &quot;Bcc: Some Other Dude &lt;me@mydomain.net&gt;&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Reply-To: $namefrom &lt;$from&gt;&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;To: $nameto &lt;$recipient&gt;&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Subject: $subject&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Message-ID: &lt;&quot;. sha1(microtime(true)) .&quot;@$hostname&gt;&quot;; //This is essential for getting to Gmail addresses.... \r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;X-Mailer: PHP/&quot;.phpversion();\r\n\t\t$headers[] = &quot;Date: $date&quot;;\r\n\t\t$headers = implode(&quot;\\r\\n&quot;, $headers);\r\n\r\n        $mnl = mail($recipient,$subject,$body,$headers,&quot;-f $from&quot;) ;\r\n\r\nSo including the -f switch in the mail function is important (to force it to send), also the headers need to be constructed in as much detail as possible to avoid getting picked up by spam filters. You will have to read up in your own time about proper header construction it&#39;s beyond the scope of what I am willing to type out here.\r\n\r\nPHP&#39;s mail function is finicky in general however, you could look at using PHPMailer as a class which makes a lot of this stuff much easier.\r\n\r\nOr you could look at using sockets or something and write your own function to send it using SMTP which is what I do sometimes, the following function is what I usually use if the chips are down and will give you at least a starting point to work from....\r\n\r\n \r\n        function authSendEmail($from, $namefrom, $to, $nameto, $subject, $headers, $message) {\r\n\r\n\r\n\t$smtpServer = &quot;mail.yourhostname.com&quot;;\r\n\t$port = &quot;25&quot;; //Or whatever the default port on your server is\r\n\t$timeout = &quot;30&quot;;\r\n\t$username = &quot;origin@yourdomain.com&quot;;\r\n\t$password = &quot;myemailpassword&quot;;\r\n\t$localhost = &quot;yourhostname.com&quot;;\r\n\t$newLine = &quot;\\r\\n&quot;;\r\n\t$date = date(&#39;r&#39;, time()); \r\n\r\n \r\n        //Connect to the host on the specified port\r\n\t$smtpConnect = fsockopen($smtpServer, $port, $errno, $errstr, $timeout);\r\n\t$smtpResponse = fgets($smtpConnect, 515);\r\n\tif(empty($smtpConnect))\t{\r\n\t\t$output = &quot;Failed to connect:

}\t\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd then you can call it like so:\r\n\r\n    $result=authSendEmail($from,$fname,$to,$nameto,$subject,$headers,$message) ; //Use SMTP\r\n    var_dump($result);\r\n\r\nHope this helps

**Start_Date** being all the start dates in your look up table;\r\n - **End_Date** being all the end dates (which is `Start_Date + Nights`) in your look up table;\r\n - **CCO** being all the critical-change-over dates which can be found using the following formula if you have named the columns as shown below in a **Table**: `=IF(MATCH([@[End Date]],[Start Date],0)&gt;0,[@[End Date]],&quot;&quot;)`\r\n\r\n[![Named Ranges][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThen follow the steps to set up the conditional formatting. **Please note the following are performed in Excel but not google-sheets**.\r\n\r\nTo set up the formatting for the critical-change-over date, you may highlight the following ranges on your worksheet: `=$U$5,$U$12,$U$19,$U$26,$U$33,$U$40`, then use the following formula as the formatting rule:\r\n\r\n    =MATCH(V5,CCO,0)&gt;0\r\n\r\nTo highlight the days on the calendar, you may highlight the following ranges on your worksheet: `=$B$5:$D$5,$B$12:$D$12,$B$19:$D$19,$B$26:$D$26,$B$33:$D$33,$B$40:$D$40`, then use the following formula as the formatting rule:\r\n\r\n    =COUNTIFS(Start_Date,&quot;&lt;=&quot;&amp;$D5,End_Date,&quot;&gt;=&quot;&amp;$D5)&gt;0\r\n\r\nThen you need to highlight `B5:D40`, use **Format Painter** to copy and paste the format to the following ranges **one range at a time**:`E5:G40`,`H5:J40`,`K5:M40`,`N5:P5`,`Q5:S5`\r\n\r\nThen you need to manually replace `$D5` within the formatting rule for each range with `$G5`,`$J5`,`$M5`,`$P5`,`$S5`.\r\n\r\nThe formatting for the last day (Saturday) is a little bit complicated as there are actually three separate columns: T, U and V and the rules for `Column T` and `Column V` are different.\r\n\r\nTo set up the formatting for `Column T`, you need to highlight the following ranges: `=$T$5,$T$12,$T$19,$T$26,$T$33,$T$40`, then use the following formula as the formatting rule:\r\n\r\n    =COUNTIFS(Start_Date,&quot;&lt;=&quot;&amp;$S5,End_Date,&quot;&gt;=&quot;&amp;$S5)&gt;0\r\n\r\nTo set up the formatting for `Column V`, you need to highlight the following ranges: `=$V$5,$V$12,$V$19,$V$26,$V$33,$V$40`, then use the following formula as the formatting rule:\r\n\r\n    =COUNTIFS(Start_Date,&quot;&lt;=&quot;&amp;$V5,End_Date,&quot;&gt;=&quot;&amp;$V5)&gt;0\r\n\r\nThe formatting for `Column U` has been explained previously in relation to critical-change-over dates.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n&gt;In the above demonstration, I have also added the conditional formatting for critical change over dates within the week not just for Saturday. If that&#39;s not necessary you can ignore. If you also want to have that set up, you can borrow the idea of setting up the formatting for `Column U`, highlight the relevant cells in Column C, F, I, L, O, and R **altogether**, and use the same formula but replace `V5` with `D5`.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any questions.

(The list/data is greyed out to the right of the calendar in the shared link above.)\r\n\r\nThe property is empty for some weeks hence the gaps between some check-in dates. Check-out is calculated from `=[check-in]+[Nights]`. Critical change overs (CCO) are calculated by the formula `=IFERROR(IF(AND(VLOOKUP([Check out of departing guest],[Check In_range],1,0),LEN([Check in of departing guest])&gt;0,LEN([Check in of arriving guest])&gt;0),[Check in of departing guest],&quot;&quot;),&quot;&quot;)` \r\n\r\nThe month and year can be changed (circled green below) to dynamically change guest names per arrival date. \r\n\r\nCritical change overs have been highlighted dynamically in the calendar if the month is changed (circled dark red below).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI now need to make the conditional formatting dynamic so the colours in the date cells (01, 02 etc) automatically style cells if the property is occupied (light red) based upon the arrival date and number of nights the guest is staying for. Each date has 3 cells, one left, one centre and one right. There are 3 to help identify events when guests arrive/depart. The best way to illustrate the desired effect is from the graphic below. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nImportantly, on 14th December, there is a critical change-over, and the center cell is shaded deep red. \r\n\r\nWhat formula can I use to make the colours change dynamically? \r\n\r\n 1.

The two versions are bellow:\r\n\r\nMethod 1\r\n```\r\ndef corpus_word_frequency(corpus_text):\r\n\r\n    bag_of_words = &quot; &quot;.join(corpus_text).split()\r\n    tokens = set(bag_of_words)\r\n\r\n    words_frequency = {}\r\n\r\n    for doc in corpus_text:\r\n        text = doc.split()\r\n\r\n        for word in tokens:\r\n            if word in text:\r\n                if word in words_frequency.keys():\r\n                    words_frequency[word] += 1\r\n                else:\r\n                    words_frequency[word] = 1\r\n\r\n    return words_frequency\r\n```\r\n\r\nMethod 2\r\n```\r\ndef corpus_word_frequency(corpus_text):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;docstring&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n    bag_of_words = &quot; &quot;.join(corpus_text).split()\r\n    tokens = set(bag_of_words)\r\n\r\n    return {\r\n        token: sum(\r\n            map(lambda doc: 1 if token in doc.split() else 0, corpus_text))\r\n        for token in tokens\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is: Method 1 is slow for my case but it&#39;s feasible but Method 2 I just couldn&#39;t stand to wait until it ends, it&#39;s just too much. So, is list comprehensions performance the problem here? the use of map and lambda? something else? There is any way to make the Method 2 more efficient?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175311/dict-list-comprehension-performance-on-text-tada","title":"dict/list comprehension performance on text tada"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","dock"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569877788,"post_id":58175310,"comment_id":102731343,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175310/dock-a-panel-to-the-right-of-the-winform-dockstyle-right-but-also-specify-a-hei#comment102731343_58175310"},{"owner":{"reputation":332,"user_id":4538529,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/661c8c2d040934ba90bf74749ed88636?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4538529/andreas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569877831,"post_id":58175310,"comment_id":102731358,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175310/dock-a-panel-to-the-right-of-the-winform-dockstyle-right-but-also-specify-a-hei#comment102731358_58175310"},{"owner":{"reputation":332,"user_id":4538529,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/661c8c2d040934ba90bf74749ed88636?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4538529/andreas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44065,"user_id":3152130,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RqxLT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TaW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3152130/taw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569878117,"post_id":58175310,"comment_id":102731450,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175310/dock-a-panel-to-the-right-of-the-winform-dockstyle-right-but-also-specify-a-hei#comment102731450_58175310"}],"owner":{"reputation":332,"user_id":4538529,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/661c8c2d040934ba90bf74749ed88636?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4538529/andreas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":28336,"user_id":74015,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b7088749adc3ec3e51982d0a3bf1b34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sam Axe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/74015/sam-axe"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569878433,"creation_date":1569877661,"last_edit_date":1569878433,"question_id":58175310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175310","body_markdown":"I am trying to find a way to dock a panel to the right of the winform but to specify\r\na height of the panel like 100.\r\nThe form height is 1000.\r\n\r\nBut the default behaviour is that the dock to the right fills the entire height of the form (1000)\r\n\r\nIs it possible in any way to specify a height as I only want a height of 100 to the right in the MIDDLE of the form?\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want a panel that covers the entire right of the form with a width of 100. \r\n```\r\n                panel1.Dock = DockStyle.Right;\r\n                panel1.Height = 100;\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175310/dock-a-panel-to-the-right-of-the-winform-dockstyle-right-but-also-specify-a-hei","title":"Dock a panel to the right of the winform DockStyle.Right, but also specify a height"},{"tags":["proxy","firefox-addon"],"owner":{"reputation":1690,"user_id":784741,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e2d4fb2f924bfe6fa88baf868a39913?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RJ Cole","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/784741/rj-cole"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569877661,"creation_date":1569877661,"question_id":58175309,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175309","body_markdown":"I am writing an extension that allows for fast adding of proxy servers to a list and fast switching between them, but my add on, once used to set ff’s proxy server, takes over as the proxy manager for ff.

discovered a slightly strange corner of Python I was hoping to get some help understanding. \r\n\r\nSuppose I have a class `B` that I want to attach as a method for class `A`. I can do:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A:\r\n  def __init__(self):\r\n    print(&quot;a self is %s &quot; % self)\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n  def __init__(self):\r\n    print(&quot;b self is %s &quot; % self)\r\n\r\nsetattr(A, &quot;B&quot;, B)\r\n\r\na = A()\r\na.B()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I call `a.B()`, in the `B.__init__` I get a `self` object for a new B instance.\r\n\r\nNow suppose I want to capture the actual value of the `a` instance in the `B` constructor. I figured out you can do it with a wrapper function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass A:\r\n  def __init__(self):\r\n    print(&quot;a self is %s &quot; % self)\r\n\r\nclass B:\r\n  def __init__(self, a_instance):\r\n    print(&quot;b self is %s a_instance is %s &quot; % (self, a_instance))\r\n\r\ndef _(*args, **kwargs):\r\n  return B(*args, **kwargs)\r\nsetattr(A, &quot;B&quot;, _)\r\n\r\na = A()\r\na.B()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the wrapper function, `a_instance` will be passed in with the actual instance reference of the `a` object.\r\n\r\nThis is helpful to know, my problem is I really don&#39;t understand what&#39;s going on. I was hoping someone could provide a clearer explanation of why, if I just `setattr` with the B class, I do not get the `a` instance, but if I `setattr` with a wrapper around the B class that just calls it, I then do get the `a` instance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175301/attaching-class-as-method","title":"Attaching class as method"},{"tags":["azure"],"owner":{"reputation":13955,"user_id":162410,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97a472a751e503a7f8e5d88ba087a87c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cedric Beust","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/162410/cedric-beust"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569877581,"creation_date":1569877581,"question_id":58175297,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58175297","body_markdown":"I am receiving a\r\n\r\n```\r\nResult: {&quot;error&quot;:{&quot;code&quot;:401000,&quot;message&quot;:&quot;The request is not authorized because credentials are missing or invalid.&quot;}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the following snippet of code.

/&gt;\r\n        &lt;li is=&quot;feedback-component&quot; class=&quot;portfolio__feedback&quot;&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nimport portfolio from &#39;@assets/data/portfolio.json&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport StoryComponent from &#39;./StoryComponent&#39;;\r\nimport FeedbackComponent from &#39;./FeedbackComponent&#39;;\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  components: {\r\n    StoryComponent,\r\n    FeedbackComponent,\r\n  },\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      portfolio,\r\n    };\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s html of my ***StoryComponent.vue***\r\n```\r\n&lt;template&gt;\r\n  &lt;li class=&quot;story&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;span class=&quot;story__name&quot;&gt;{{ storyName }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;span class=&quot;story__title&quot;&gt;{{ storyTitle }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n  &lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;\r\n```\r\nHope that&#39;s enough and I&#39;ve explained that clear.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175285/vue-insert-the-component-inside-the-array-list","title":"VUE Insert the component inside the array list"},{"tags":["java","if-statement"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":445,"user_id":5809739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f32c739c1ddebf4a220a79bc1c48868?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Niklas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5809739/niklas"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569877587,"post_id":58175283,"comment_id":102731271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175283/what-is-the-best-way-to-refactor-multiple-conditions-in-an-if-statement#comment102731271_58175283"},{"owner":{"reputation":97233,"user_id":3788176,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c18d321d8948803c05643d87b003dc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andy Turner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788176/andy-turner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569877667,"post_id":58175283,"comment_id":102731300,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175283/what-is-the-best-way-to-refactor-multiple-conditions-in-an-if-statement#comment102731300_58175283"},{"owner":{"reputation":666,"user_id":2615510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ysddf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrey Lebedenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2615510/andrey-lebedenko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569924001,"post_id":58175283,"comment_id":102744603,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175283/what-is-the-best-way-to-refactor-multiple-conditions-in-an-if-statement#comment102744603_58175283"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14784,"user_id":9959152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSjIJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deadpool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9959152/deadpool"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14784,"user_id":9959152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XSjIJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deadpool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9959152/deadpool"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569878145,"last_edit_date":1569878145,"creation_date":1569877783,"answer_id":58175337,"question_id":58175283,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58175337","body_markdown":"First collect all the keys into list and using java-8 `streams.anyMatch`\r\n\r\n    List&lt;String&gt;
