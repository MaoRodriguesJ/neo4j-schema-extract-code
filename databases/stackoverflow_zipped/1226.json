Oracle was using the Oracle Binary Code License (OBCL) for Java.  This had field of use restrictions (you needed a commercial license for embedded use) but granted free use of the Oracle JDK for general purpose development and deployment.\r\n 2. As of JDK 11, the license changed to the Oracle Technology Network License Agreement (OTNLA), which requires you to purchase a Java SE Subscription for use in commercial production.  This license has also been applied to updates of JDK 8 since April (update 211/212).\r\n 3. As of JDK 11, Oracle eliminated all functional differences between the Oracle JDK and a binary built purely from the OpenJDK source code.  The important things no longer in the Oracle JDK 11 are the browser plugin, Java Web Start and JavaFX.\r\n 4. You can continue to use any public Oracle binaries of JDK 7 (and earlier) in production without the need for a Java SE subscription, as the license is still the OBCL (it has not been changed retrospectively).  You can also, as you say, use JDK 8 up to update 202 under the OBCL without cost.\r\n 5. There are several options for continuing to use JDK 8 with updates for free.  One of those is Zulu Community from Azul (who I work for).  This is a free, TCK-tested binary with a couple of additional backported features (TLS 1.3 and Java Flight Recorder).  Since this passes the TCK, from a functional perspective, it is identical to the Oracle JDK.  Unless you are using Applets or Web Start your applications will work in the same way as with the Oracle JDK.\r\n 6. If you want to move to JDK 11 (the current long-term support release, as defined by Oracle but followed by all other JDK providers), then you will need to choose one of the free distributions (like Zulu Community).\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended to ensure your JDK is up to date and contains all relevant security patches.  Continuing to use an older version could expose you to significant security exploits.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250782/which-free-version-of-java-can-i-use-for-production-environments-and-or-commerci/58257869#58257869","title":"Which free version of java

Any other use, needs a **Commercial License**\r\n- (2) Legacy versions prior to 7, does not have and will not have any update. Maybe a sales contact could be a solution if an update in these versions are required for Legacy Systems Support.\r\n- (3) If I want to use java 8 oracle version for **commercials purposes** and **FREE**, I need to use a previous version of **April 16, 2019 8u221 update**\r\n- (4) An alternative to oracle java 8 version for **commercials purposes** and **FREE** are these [java open implementations](https://gist.github.com/jrichardsz/83db09163ca9a0db4c9cd4f91cbf0598)\r\n- (5) Oracle Java 9 y 10 has reached end of support.  \r\n  - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html\r\n  - https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk10-downloads-4416644.html\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n\r\nAccording to my conclusions:\r\n\r\n- If my development strictly needs or was developed with **JDK 8**, Can I only use Oracle Java SE 8 [JDK 8u202 and earlier versions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html?printOnly=1) for **FREE** and **commercial purposes** accepting issues and security problems?\r\n- If I can change my development **and** I want still **FREE**, **and** I want to have improvements and security updates, I must use one of these  [java open implementations](https://gist.github.com/jrichardsz/83db09163ca9a0db4c9cd4f91cbf0598)?\r\n\r\n---\r\n# References\r\n\r\n- [End of Public Updates for Oracle JDK 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/java-se-support-roadmap.html)\r\n- [The Oracle JDK License has changed for releases starting April 16, 2019.](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\r\n- [Official List of updates and release versions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u-relnotes-2225394.html)\r\n- [Java official supported versions](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)\r\n- [Oracle Java 8 download alert](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)\r\n- [Oracle Java 8 unsupported but free version](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-javase8-2177648.html?printOnly=1)\r\n- [Java 4 legacy official download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase-v14-downloads.html)\r\n- [Java 5 legacy official download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-archive-javase5-downloads.html)\r\n- [Java 6 legacy official download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-java-archive-javase6-downloads.html)\r\n- [Java 7 legacy official download page](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase7-521261.html)\r\n\r\n# Note\r\n\r\n&gt;

Make `myFilter` a struct instead of class and name it properly as `MyFilter`.\r\n2. You never initialize your `filterArray`, you only declare it.\r\n3. You need to create a new instance of `MyFilter` for each url/name pair you want to add to the array.\r\n4. You don&#39;t need to use `enumerated` in this case.\r\n4. You have the wrong return type for your `getFilter` function (I think).\r\n5. Use proper naming conventions.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s cleaned up code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct MyFilter {\r\n    var myURL: URL?\r\n    var name: String\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc getFilters() -&gt; [MyFilter] {\r\n    var filterArray = [MyFilter]()\r\n    if let filters = QuartzFilterManager.filters(inDomains: nil) {\r\n        for eachFilter in filters {\r\n            let filter = MyFilter(myURL: (eachFilter as!

Having to cast `eachFilter` using `as! QuartzFilter` is clunky.\r\n\r\nAnd other uses of `!` are bad. Force-unwrapping the call to `localizedName()` can crash.

I already can use methods which interact with entity `A`(or which doesn&#39;t even have an entity) in the `B` entity repository (`JpaRepository&lt;B, ID&gt;`), so obviously this is not a problem for `JPA`.

Those operate in compiled code.\r\n\r\nFor example with your case:\r\n\r\nDefine an array:\r\n\r\n    In [10]: a = np.random.randint(0,10,9)                                          \r\n    In [11]: a                                                                      \r\n    Out[11]: array([6, 0, 2, 5, 0, 5, 2, 0, 1])\r\n\r\nCompare it with the range of `n` values - using whole array `==` test (and `broadcasting`.  The result is a boolean array, a True/False value for each (i,j):\r\n\r\n    In [12]: np.arange(8)[:,None]==a                                                \r\n    Out[12]: \r\n    array([[False,  True, False, False,  True, False, False,  True, False],\r\n           [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False,  True],\r\n           [False, False,  True, False, False, False,  True, False, False],\r\n           [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n           [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n           [False, False, False,  True, False,  True, False, False, False],\r\n           [ True, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n           [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]])\r\n\r\nGiven that, it&#39;s easy to map it onto a (-1,1) values.  `np.where` is just one such way:\r\n\r\n    In [13]: np.where(np.arange(8)[:,None]==a, 1, -1)                               \r\n    Out[13]: \r\n    array([[-1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  1],\r\n           [-1, -1,  1, -1, -1, -1,  1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [ 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]])\r\n\r\nCloser to your map idea, we could define a function that operates on a pair of scalar values:\r\n\r\n    def foo(i,x):\r\n        if i==x:\r\n            return 1\r\n        else:\r\n            return -1\r\n\r\nand use `np.vectorize` to make a function that takes 2 arrays, and passes pairs of scalars to this function.\r\n\r\n    In [16]: np.vectorize(foo)(np.arange(8)[:,None], a)                              \r\n    Out[16]: \r\n    array([[-1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1, -1,  1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1,  1],\r\n           [-1, -1,  1, -1, -1, -1,  1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1,  1, -1,  1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [ 1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n           [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]])\r\n\r\nBut this is MUCH slower than the first approach.\r\n\r\nA list comprehension approach:\r\n\r\n    In [22]: [[(1 if i==x else -1) for x in a] for i in range(8)]                   \r\n    Out[22]: \r\n    [[-1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1, -1],\r\n     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 1],\r\n     [-1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1, 1, -1, -1],\r\n     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n     [-1, -1, -1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n     [1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],\r\n     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1]]\r\n\r\nwhich can then be made into an array (this may actually be faster than the `vectorize` approach).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250744/how-to-generate-a-matrix-as-follows/58251743#58251743","title":"How to generate a matrix as follows?"}],"owner":{"reputation":234,"user_id":9969435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1c80a14a471ff836f26cf7880f4d3ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user42493","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9969435/user42493"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58251743,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570304843,"creation_date":1570296842,"last_edit_date":1570300654,"question_id":58250744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250744","body_markdown":"So given number `n` and an array `a`, we need to create a `n` by `len(a)` matrix where the `i,j`th entry of the matrix is `1` if `i` equals to `j`th entry of `a` and `-1` otherwise.

There are two things that I&#39;d change:\r\n\r\n - Define the argument of the inline function as unit so that there is no confusion about its type\r\n - Keep the mutable `IdInt`  variable local to the `idGenerator` so that it&#39;s hidden (and you can also use more idiomatic `camelCase` naming for it)\r\n\r\nSo, my slightly modified version would be:\r\n\r\n    let idGenerator = \r\n        let mutable idInt = 0\r\n        fun () -&gt;\r\n            idInt &lt;-  idInt + 1\r\n            idInt |&gt; Id\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it is also useful to make this a function that creates new generators (in case you want to have more local generators rather than one global):\r\n\r\n\r\n    let makeIdGenerator () = \r\n        let mutable idInt = 0\r\n        fun () -&gt;\r\n            idInt &lt;-  idInt + 1\r\n            idInt |&gt; Id\r\n\r\n    let idGen1 = makeIdGenerator ()\r\n    let idGen2 = makeIdGenerator ()\r\n\r\nThe two generators will independently generate IDs starting from 1.

generators.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250721/how-to-implement-a-simple-id-generator/58250763#58250763","title":"How to implement a simple

this is more difficult than I though, due to some broadcasting issues of sparse matrices. Additionally, in the short period of time I was not able to fully vectorize it. \r\n\r\nI added an additional text row to the frame:\r\n```\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&quot;id&quot;,&quot;text&quot;],index=None)\r\ndf.loc[0] = [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;this is a sample text&quot;]\r\ndf.loc[1] = [&quot;2&quot;,&quot;this is a second sample text&quot;]\r\n\r\nimport collections\r\n\r\nsample_dict = collections.defaultdict()\r\nsample_dict[&quot;r1&quot;] = &quot;this is sample 1&quot; \r\nsample_dict[&quot;r2&quot;] = &quot;is sample&quot; \r\nsample_dict[&quot;r3&quot;] = &quot;sample text 2&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will use the following modules/functions/classes:\r\n```\r\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\r\nfrom scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n```\r\n\r\nand define a CountVectorizer to create character based n_grams\r\n```\r\nngram_vectorizer = CountVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 2), analyzer=&quot;char&quot;)\r\n```\r\nfeel free to choose the n-grams you need. I&#39;d advise to take an existing tokenizer and n-gram creator. You should find plenty of those. Also the CountVectorizer can be tweaked extensively (e.g. convert to lowercase, get rid of whitespace etc.)\r\n\r\nWe concatenate all the data:\r\n```\r\nall_data = np.concatenate((df.text.to_numpy(),np.array(list(sample_dict.values()))))\r\n```\r\nwe do this, as our vectorizer needs to have a common indexing scheme for all the tokens appearing.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s fit the Count vectorizer and transform the data accordingly:\r\n```\r\nngrammed = ngram_vectorizer.fit_transform(all_data) &gt;0\r\n```\r\n`ngrammed` is now a sparse matrix containing the identifiers to the tokens appearing in the respective rows and not the counts anymore as before. you can inspect the [`ngram_vecotrizer` ](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) and find a mapping from tokens to column ids.\r\n\r\nNext we want to compare every grammes entry from the sample dict against every row of our ngrammed text data. We need some magic here:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntexts = ngrammed[:len(df)]\r\nsamples = ngrammed[len(df):]\r\ntext_rows = len(df)\r\n\r\njaccard_similarities = []\r\nfor key, ngram_sample in zip(sample_dict.keys(), samples):\r\n    repeated_row_matrix = (csr_matrix(np.ones([text_rows,1])) * ngram_sample).astype(bool)\r\n    support = texts.maximum(repeated_row_matrix)\r\n    intersection = texts.multiply(repeated_row_matrix).todense()\r\n    jaccard_similarities.append(pd.Series((intersection.sum(axis=1)/support.sum(axis=1)).A1, name=key))\r\n```\r\n`support` is the boolean array, that measures the union of the n-grams over both comparable. `intersection` is only True if a token is present in both comparable. Note that `.A1` represents a `matrix`-object as the underlying base array.\r\n\r\nNow\r\n```\r\npd.concat(jaccard_similarities, axis=1)\r\n```\r\ngives\r\n```\r\n         r1        r2        r3\r\n0  0.631579  0.444444  0.500000\r\n1  0.480000  0.333333  0.384615\r\n```\r\nyou can concat is as well to `df` and obtain with\r\n```\r\npd.concat([df, pd.concat(jaccard_similarities, axis=1)], axis=1)\r\n  id                          text        r1        r2        r3\r\n0  1         this is a sample text  0.631579  0.444444  0.500000\r\n1  2  this is a second sample text  0.480000  0.333333  0.384615\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250720/how-to-build-features-using-pandas-column-and-a-dictionary-efficiently/58251672#58251672","title":"How to build features using pandas column and a dictionary efficiently?"}],"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":3619334,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFvky.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shreyas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3619334/shreyas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":102,"user_id":3619334,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lFvky.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shreyas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3619334/shreyas"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":94,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58251672,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571251644,"creation_date":1570296658,"last_edit_date":1570300044,"question_id":58250720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250720","body_markdown":"I have a machine learning problem where I am calculating bigram Jaccard similarity of a pandas dataframe text column with values of a dictionary.

Or you can even create a unique index on all 3 columns. These two ideas are thus code free.\r\n\r\nLast but least, you could use a Before change  macro,and do a search (lookup) in  the table to check if the existing record exists. So far, given your information, likely a unique index is the least effort, and does not require you to change the PK to all 3 columns (which as noted is a another solution).\r\n\r\nSo, you could consider a before change  macro. And use this:\r\n\r\n    Lookup a Record in MyTable\r\n       Where Condition = [z].[Field1]=[MyTable].[Field1] And \r\n                         [z].[Field2]=[MyTable].[Field2] And \r\n                         [z].[ID]&lt;&gt;[MyTable].[ID]\r\n       Alias Z\r\n       RaiseError   -123\r\n       Error Description: There are other rows with this data\r\n\r\nSo, you can use a data macro, use the before change table macro. Make sure you have the raise error code indented &quot;inside&quot; of the look up code. And note how we use a alias for the look up, since the table name (MyTable) is already in context, and is already the current row of data, so we lookup using &quot;z&quot; as a alias to distinguish between the current row, and that of lookup record.\r\n\r\nSo, from a learning point of view, the above table macro can be used, but it likely less work and effort to simply setup a uniquie index  on all 3 columns. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250680/avoid-duplicate-records-with-beforechange-table-event/58251154#58251154","title":"Avoid Duplicate Records with BeforeChange Table Event"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12169535,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCdJJkRqlm1W0qK83oAQt_tmdZ_VBh-9GATVmOQig=k-s128","display_name":"Milan Krivic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169535/milan-krivic"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10285,"user_id":7531598,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DKnSq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lee Mac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7531598/lee-mac"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570300046,"creation_date":1570296275,"last_edit_date":1570296667,"question_id":58250680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250680","body_markdown":"I have a situation in MS Access database that I must prevent duplicate records based on combination of three attributes:\r\n\r\n* `StudentNumber`\r\n* `ColleagueID`\r\n* `TypeOfAttending`\r\n\r\nSo, for one combination (`StudentNumber` &amp;

Consider the following operations:\r\n\r\n1. Open a connection window 1 in SQL Server Management Studio\r\n2. `BEGIN` a transaction, then delete about 2000 rows of data from table A\r\n3. Open another connection window 2 in SQL Server Management Studio\r\n4. Insert one new row of data into table A in window 2 (no transaction), it runs successfully right now\r\n \r\nThen, I repeat the same operation, but in STEP 2 I delete 10k rows of data, in that case, STEP 4 can&#39;t run successfully. I had already waited for half an hour. \r\n\r\nIt shows that it is executing SQL...can&#39;t finish.  Finally, I insert the data using connection window 1, it works right now.\r\n\r\nWhy does it work with 2k rows but not 10k rows?\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________\r\n**The Sql sentence I execute:**\r\n\r\nIn connection windows A, I execute\r\n  BEGIN TRAN\r\n  Delete from tableA (10K rows)\r\n\r\nIn connection windows B, I execute\r\n   Insert into tableA(..) VALUES (...)\r\n\r\nwindows B can&#39;t executes successfully.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nMany thanks @Gordon \r\n\r\n**The cause**:\r\n\r\nI search the keyword about lock escalation.\r\nI try to track lock escalation using SQL Server Profiler, and I get a\r\nlock:escalation when I delete many data in a transaction(I don&#39;t commit or rollback).\r\n\r\nSo, I know the concept of lock escalation.\r\nI delete too much data in a table ,then the row locks escalation to table escalation.I didn&#39;t commit or rollback them, other connection (or application)\r\ncan&#39;t access the table with table lock.\r\n[trace lock escalation in sql profiler ][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GNd6A.png\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n**When the lock escalation happens in MSSQL Server**\r\n\r\n&quot;The locks option also affects when lock escalation occurs. When locks is set to 0, lock escalation occurs when the memory used by the current lock structures reaches 40 percent of the Database Engine memory pool. When locks is not set to 0, lock escalation occurs when the number of locks reaches 40 percent of the value specified for locks.&quot;\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\n**How to set Using SQL Server Management Studio that will impact lock escalation:**\r\n\r\nTo configure the locks option\r\nIn Object Explorer, right-click a server and select Properties .\r\n\r\nClick the Advanced node.\r\n\r\nUnder Parallelism , type the desired value for the locks option.\r\n\r\nUse the locks option to set the maximum number of available locks, such limiting the amount of memory SQL Server uses for them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250674/why-sql-statement-doesnt-work-how-do-transactions-work","title":"Why SQL statement doesn&#39;t work?

This will update all Customers because I have no WHERE clause, right?\r\n\r\nYes. Consider adding a WHERE clause such as:\r\n\r\n    WHERE Id IN (SELECT DISTINCT CustomerId FROM @CustomerBalances)\r\n\r\nThis prevents updating balances that haven&#39;t changed.\r\n\r\n&gt;2. This correctly handles cases where a customer has more than one matching row in the @CustomerBalances table, right?\r\n\r\nYes. Because you use SUM() to aggregate them.\r\n\r\n&gt;3. Is the EXISTS clause needed here?\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s recommended rather than essential. It&#39;s good practice so that you only attempt to update balances when records have been archived.\r\n\r\n&gt;4. Will SUM() return 0 or NULL if there are no matching rows?\r\n\r\nYes, this is a bug that will cause balances to be set to NULL (or error if NULL not allowed) for customers who had no transactions archived. This will be fixed by adding the WHERE clause noted above. If you&#39;re trying to avoid the WHERE for some reason you can fix it with COALESCE(SUM(Amount),0.00)\r\n\r\n&gt;5. Does everything get cleaned up if I don&#39;t have the final DELETE statement?\r\n\r\nYes. When the procedure completes, the table variable will go out of scope automatically, so the DELETE isn&#39;t need, as far as this snippet shows.\r\n\r\n&gt;6. It is critical that no changes are made to the Transactions or Customers table while I&#39;m doing this. Does my use of TABLOCK make sense here?\r\n\r\nYes, but you should also specify HOLDLOCK to keep the lock until the transaction completes.\r\n\r\n&gt;7. Any suggestions about the overall approach I&#39;m taking?\r\n\r\nSee above, but in general it looks to be reasonable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250656/questions-about-stored-procedure-to-update-row-with-total-value-of-rows-deleted/58251142#58251142","title":"Questions about stored procedure to update row with total value of rows deleted"}],"owner":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58251142,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570300450,"creation_date":1570296077,"question_id":58250656,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250656","body_markdown":"I want to delete rows from a `Transactions` table (which has a foreign key to my `Customers` table), and then update `Customers.StartingBalance` to reflect the sum of the deleted amounts.\r\n\r\nSo I have created a stored procedure.

THe number of rows visible (whether there is data available for them or not) should also increase or decreased based on the available table/container height\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250634/set-minimum-number-of-rows-on-angular-material-table","title":"Set minimum number of rows on angular material table"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":495,"user_id":10294689,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ace5f1e6d8a8387d0290f1eeffef00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex_P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10294689/alex-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570296157,"post_id":58250633,"comment_id":102871677,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250633/r-fsolve-help-for-variable#comment102871677_58250633"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12169537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e13a25f7257295895e3869ca3dcaa5fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"comphelp-89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169537/comphelp-89"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":495,"user_id":10294689,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ace5f1e6d8a8387d0290f1eeffef00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex_P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10294689/alex-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570297145,"post_id":58250633,"comment_id":102871939,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250633/r-fsolve-help-for-variable#comment102871939_58250633"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12169537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e13a25f7257295895e3869ca3dcaa5fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"comphelp-89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169537/comphelp-89"},"last_editor":{"reputation":495,"user_id":10294689,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ace5f1e6d8a8387d0290f1eeffef00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex_P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10294689/alex-p"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570299926,"creation_date":1570295862,"last_edit_date":1570299926,"question_id":58250633,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250633","body_markdown":"I have a function that has been defined as\r\n\r\n```\r\nff&lt;-function(x,y){\r\nresult&lt;-(2*x*y)+(2*x)-(x^2)-(2*(y^2))\r\nreturn(result)\r\n}\r\n\r\nh=numeric()    \r\ngradient&lt;-function(fun,x0,y0,fx, fy){\r\n    ff2&lt;-replace(of,c(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;),c((x0+(fx*h)),(y0+(fy*h))))\r\n  grad&lt;-solve(ff2,0)\r\n  return (grad)\r\n}\r\ngradient(ff, -1,1,6,-6)\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to create a new function called `ff2` by replacing all of the Xs with (-1+6h) and Ys with (-1+-6h) from ff\r\nand solve for Y\r\nh is a variable that has been declared as `h=numeric()`\r\nI&#39;m encountering two issues:\r\n\r\n 1.

I verified this with Bluehost chat support. And using SSH shell access, you can then run the socket.io server continuously in the background. Does this seem right? It seems like a lot of trouble for something that a lot of apps probably use...\r\n\r\nEven when I run this off the localhost, I have to use node in the terminal to run the socket.io server.\r\n\r\nAnd it looks like a dedicated server is required to be able to open ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36182900/php-websocket-on-bluehost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250610/react-native-how-to-get-socket-io-to-work-on-live-server","title":"React-Native: How to get socket.io to work on live server"},{"tags":["c#","debugging","asp.net-core",".net-core","asp.net-core-3.0"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570385363,"post_id":58259932,"comment_id":102888675,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250609/issue-after-migrating-from-2-2-to-3-0-default-works-but-cant-access-area-is-t/58259932#comment102888675_58259932"},{"owner":{"reputation":2117,"user_id":1196886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5143984de4abf18cfe2aaef3f1fff7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ronan Thibaudau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1196886/ronan-thibaudau"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570395729,"post_id":58259932,"comment_id":102890954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250609/issue-after-migrating-from-2-2-to-3-0-default-works-but-cant-access-area-is-t/58259932#comment102890954_58259932"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2117,"user_id":1196886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5143984de4abf18cfe2aaef3f1fff7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ronan Thibaudau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1196886/ronan-thibaudau"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570384804,"creation_date":1570384804,"answer_id":58259932,"question_id":58250609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58259932","body_markdown":"I fixed it by going with a static url start instead of the {area:exists} as i found that in a sample online, this doesn&#39;ts sound like a &quot;clean&quot; fix but it does fix my issue so my solution was to go from \r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        endpoints.MapAreaControllerRoute(&quot;areas&quot;, &quot;areas&quot;, &quot;{area:exists}/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}&quot;);\r\n        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(&quot;default&quot;,&quot;{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nTo \r\n\r\n\r\n    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        endpoints.MapAreaControllerRoute(&quot;Back&quot;, &quot;Back&quot;, &quot;back/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}&quot;);\r\n        endpoints.MapControllerRoute(&quot;default&quot;,&quot;{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nAlso note sure if it caused the issue or if it was already there but it broke identity ui routing (only that area has authentication so now instead of a blank page i&#39;m redirected to /Identity/... as expected, but that page is now blank)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58250609/issue-after-migrating-from-2-2-to-3-0-default-works-but-cant-access-area-is-t/58259932#58259932","title":"Issue after migrating from 2.2 to 3.0, default works but can&#39;t access area, is there anyway to debug the endpoint resolution?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2117,"user_id":1196886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5143984de4abf18cfe2aaef3f1fff7c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ronan Thibaudau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1196886/ronan-thibaudau"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570384804,"creation_date":1570295561,"question_id":58250609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58250609","body_markdown":"I migrated an asp.net core 2.2 app to 3.0 today, took a bit but everything recompiles and the front (default) works fine, but i can&#39;t access the back (separate area).

is a common issue of the AVPlayer framework. The fix however is quite simply assuming that your AVPlayer is inside a regular view. Firstly, make your videoPlayer or the view that it is inside a global variable. You do this by declaring it outside of any class.

Using global variables is almost always (if not always) a bad idea.

So maybe it&#39;s an idea if you use this in the view controller where you have the player. Maybe you can register for these notifications on viewDidAppear and unregister on viewDidDisappear or something like that. Or maybe just register on the viewDidLoad.

That is undefined behaviour.  \r\nYou need to use correct format specifiers to avoid that. In this case `%c`.  \r\nAdditionally, to skip the newline/return which you find in the input after scanning a number, use a blank beforehand, i.e. `&quot; %c&quot;`.\r\n\r\nEnd of the answer, with undefined behaviour, anything can happen.\r\n\r\nJust for fun however, try this code and use 2 and 257 as input:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n\r\n    int a=99, b=98;\r\n    char c=&#39;x&#39;;\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;Enter 2 numbers:\\n&quot;);\r\n    scanf(&quot;%d %d&quot;, &amp;a, &amp;b);\r\n    printf(&quot;You entered %d %d. Now enter an operator:\\n&quot;, a, b);\r\n    scanf(&quot; %s&quot;, &amp;c);\r\n    printf(&quot;After scanning a null-terminated string into a char variable, a and b are now %d %d.\\n&quot;, a,b);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n If we are lucky and you get the same effect of undefined behaviour as I do, then you have now learned something about where the 0 at the end of the operator string ends up. Namely in one of the bytes of the variable `b`.\r\n\r\nWith the proposed input you probably get 2 and 256.
