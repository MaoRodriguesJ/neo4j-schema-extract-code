It is intended for administrative purposes, for example as a database to connect to if you want to run `CREATE DATABASE`.\r\n\r\n  This has nothing to do with users.\r\n\r\n- Users are cluster-wide, that is, all databases in a cluster share the same users. Note that that does not imply that every user can connect to each database.\r\n\r\n- PostgreSQL command line programs have two defaults:\r\n\r\n  - If you don&#39;t specify a database user, the default is the database user that is called like the operating system user.\r\n\r\n  - If you don&#39;t specify a database, the default is the database with the same name as the database user.\r\n\r\nI assume that it is this last default that inspires your question.\r\n**This is just a default value and should not influence your database design.**\r\n\r\n- Create one database for each separate body of data, like all the data that belong to one application.\r\n\r\n- Create users as your application and data maintenance procedures require. It is a good idea to use different users for different tasks. For example, the user that performs the backup should not be used by your application to connect to the database.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020420/should-i-create-a-database-for-every-user-in-postgresql/58023228#58023228","title":"Should I create a database for every user in PostgreSQL?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2550,"user_id":3841161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acf3ec13097b93112cf97da8cf4e06a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"coladict","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3841161/coladict"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568963539,"creation_date":1568963539,"answer_id":58023454,"question_id":58020420,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023454","body_markdown":"No. Even if it&#39;s a local admin user so you don&#39;t need to go through `sudo`, you should just add `export PGDATABASE=postgres` to your `.bashrc` or `.profile`.

Then use a combination of join/split to achieve the desired result:\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    st = &#39;1. John Smith1, John Smith2, John Smith3, etc.&lt;br&gt;&#39;\r\n    re2 = r&quot;(\\d+\\.\\s+)(.+)(&lt;br&gt;)$&quot;\r\n    sections = re.findall(re3, st)\r\n\r\n    # just to make it clearer i&#39;ll split the sections\r\n    the_number, the_core, the_end = sections[0]\r\n\r\n    # rework the core\r\n    the_core = &#39;]], [[&#39;.join(the_core.split(&#39;,&#39;))\r\n\r\n    # glue all the pieces together adding what&#39;s missing\r\n    new_st = the_number + &#39;[[&#39; + the_core + &#39;]]&#39; + the_end\r\n\r\nwhich gives as result:\r\n    \r\n    &#39;1.

John Smith1, John Smith2, John Smith3, etc.&lt;br&gt;```\r\n\r\nWhat I want to end up with is:  \r\n```1. [[John Smith1]], [[John Smith2]], [[John Smith3]], [[etc.]]&lt;br&gt;```\r\n\r\nI tried using this regex:  \r\n```(.+?)(?:, |(&lt;br&gt;)$)```\r\n\r\nwith this replacement:  \r\n```[[\\1]], \\2```\r\n\r\nBut it is giving this result:  \r\n```[[1. John Smith1]], [[John Smith2]], [[John Smith3]], [[etc.,]]&lt;br&gt;```\r\n\r\n1. How do I move the initial &quot;\\d\\.\\s&quot; outside the first name capture?\r\n2. How do I prevent the final comma after the last name (in this case, etc. instead of etc.,)?\r\n\r\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**  \r\nMy apologies for not being more specific. When I stated I wanted to match this, I should have said match &quot;only&quot; this pattern.\r\n\r\nWhen I used this regex: ```(?&lt;=\\.\\s|,\\s)([^,\\r\\n]+)\\s*(?=&lt;br&gt;|,)``` and this replacement ```[[\\1]]```it did two unexpected things.  \r\n1. Although it works in regex101.com, when I look at the output in Notepad++, all the names are changed to SOH, and in Notepad they become non-printing characters.  \r\n2. It is too aggressive, so it changed every instance of multiple items separated by commas.\r\nSo the output from this:  \r\n```1. John Smith1, John Smith2, John Smith3, John Smith4&lt;br&gt;```  \r\n```This is the reason why John Smith1, John Smith2, John Smith3, and John Smith4 did what they did.&lt;br&gt;```\r\n  \r\nlooks like this in Notepad++: \r\n\r\n```1. [[SOH]], [[SOH]], [[SOH]], [[SOH]]&lt;br&gt;```  \r\n```This is the reason why John Smith1, [[SOH]], [[SOH]], and John Smith4 did what they did.&lt;br&gt;```  \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll give the other suggestions a try to see if any work.\r\n\r\nThanks again.\r\n\r\n**Latest Update**\r\nI solved the non-printing issue. I forgot to escape the substitution string in the regex with &quot;r&quot;. Now, if I can get the regex to stop at the first `&lt;br&gt;`, I should get what I need. Still searching...  \r\n\r\nOne other thing: there will be more numbered lines with comma-separated names and descriptions with line breaks in the string. So  \r\n```\r\n1. FirstName1 LastName1, FirstName2 LastName2, FirstName3 LastName3&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName1 LastName1, FirstName2 LastName2, FirstName3 LastName3&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n2. FirstName3 LastName3, FirstName4 LastName4&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName3 and FirstName4 LastName4.&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n3. FirstName3 LastName3, FirstName6 LastName6&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName3 and FirstName6.&lt;br&gt;\r\n```  \r\nStill only want to change the lines beginning with number/period/space and ending with line break.\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. [[FirstName1 LastName1]], [[FirstName2 LastName2]], [[FirstName3 LastName3]]&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName1 LastName1, FirstName2 LastName2, FirstName3 LastName3&lt;br&gt;  \r\n\r\n2. [[FirstName3 LastName3]], [[FirstName4 LastName4]]&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName3 and FirstName4 LastName4.&lt;br&gt;  \r\n\r\n3. [[FirstName3 LastName3]], [[FirstName6 LastName6]]&lt;br&gt;  \r\nDescription with FirstName3 and FirstName6.&lt;br&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t match the word &quot;Description&quot;. It is only used as an example.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020418/how-to-replaces-commas-in-list-of-names-separated-by-commas","title":"How to replaces commas in list of names separated by commas"},{"tags":["node.js","ajv"],"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":10426052,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/163f57fcf9ec8eb142222cd06a26cb5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Baterka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10426052/baterka"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568940514,"creation_date":1568940514,"question_id":58020417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020417","body_markdown":"I am using `ajv-errors` with `ajv` and I found problem.\r\n\r\nIs there way to replace error messages for centrain keywords BUT in whole schema and not just one level?\r\n\r\nI was reading docs (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv-errors#messages-for-keywords) and found only way to replace it in current schema only what means I need to define it again if I for example use `if/then/else`.\r\n\r\nShould I somehow define it once and then use it automatically everywhere?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020417/ajv-errors-replace-errors-for-certain-keywords-in-the-whole-schema","title":"ajv-errors - Replace errors for certain keywords in the whole schema"},{"tags":["spring-boot-admin"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2451,"user_id":2980345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpItT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ndrone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2980345/ndrone"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568986349,"creation_date":1568986349,"answer_id":58029410,"question_id":58020413,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58029410","body_markdown":"Found the answer after running the config server in debug mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\n   SpringBootAdminClientAutoConfiguration:\r\n      Did not match:\r\n         - Spring Boot Client is disabled, because &#39;spring.boot.admin.client.url&#39; is empty.

so after thinking through this question many times I realized that my thinking was right but only with regards to how the actual solution itself is framed. I found that you can think about this situation in two ways, keeping the following in mind.\r\n\r\nSo first, approaching this scenario, we start by looking at the work inside each call to `permutation`:\r\n\r\n - `System.out.println(prefix);` --&gt; O(n)\r\n - `String rem = str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i+1);` --&gt; O(n)\r\n - `permutation(rem, prefix+str.charAt(i));` --&gt; O(1) [this is not taking recursion into account yet!!!]\r\n\r\nSo now we know the amount of work done inside each node in the overall call tree. Now we consider the recursion. There are two different ways of thinking about this.\r\n\r\n#1) Recursion combined with loop\r\n\r\nSince both the loop and the recursive call result in `permutation` being called, we can simply worry about the overall number of calls to `permutation` rather than differentiating between the loop and regular recursive calls. Thus, we take an example string, let&#39;s say &#39;abc&#39; and examine the call tree&#39;s leaf nodes:\r\n\r\n 1. &#39;abc&#39; --&gt; 1 node\r\n 2. &#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39; --&gt; 3 nodes\r\n 3. &#39;ab&#39;, &#39;ac&#39;, &#39;ba&#39;, &#39;bc&#39;, &#39;ca&#39;, &#39;cb&#39; --&gt; 6 nodes\r\n\r\nThus, we see that we have 6 leaf nodes. We can immediately see that this is equal to 3! where 3 is the length of our input string &#39;abc&#39;. Thus, the amount of leaf nodes will be `n!` where `n` corresponds to input string length. The depth of the call tree will always be `n` since recursion stops when `n=0`. Thus, the total number of nodes in our call tree will be `n*n!`. Since each node corresponds to `O(n)` work, our total work done is `O(n x n x n!) = O((n + 2)!)` [we can do this because we can drop constants!].\r\n\r\n#2) Recursion separate from loop\r\n\r\nNow, this is where my confusion and thus this question stemmed from. It seemed logical that the work done in each node would be `O(n^2)` rather than `O(n)` since the `for` loop is inside the node right? In this case, I was thinking of the for loop and the recursion as separate entities. But, this way of thinking is not really correct because the `for` loop is not just running `n` times each time it gets called, rather, it runs `n` times, then `n-1` times, then `n-2`, etc. In total, it runs `n!` times *each time it is started*. Thus, we have `n!` runs, each time doing `O(n)` work means a total of `O(n x n!)` runs once started. But, now we have only considered the number of times the `for` loop runs *each time* it is called. How many times is it actually started? Well that would be `n` times because we can see the recursion ends when `n=0`. Hence, `n x n x n!` once again.\r\n\r\n&gt;Now if you spot an error in my reasoning (especially with the 2nd way of thinking), please do not hesitate to point it out! I want to make sure that I am thinking about this correctly.\r\n\r\n \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020392/runtime-for-function-with-loop-involving-recursive-calls/58033416#58033416","title":"Runtime for function with loop involving recursive calls"}],"owner":{"reputation":756,"user_id":5150335,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3EwsD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Markoe7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5150335/markoe7"},"last_editor":{"reputation":756,"user_id":5150335,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3EwsD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Markoe7","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5150335/markoe7"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":63,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569006235,"creation_date":1568940280,"last_edit_date":1569006235,"question_id":58020392,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020392","body_markdown":"I am doing the following problem:\r\n\r\n*Find the time complexity of the following code:*\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd my thought process is as follows:\r\n\r\nLooking at the work done inside each call to `permutation`:\r\n\r\n`System.out.println(prefix);` would take O(n) time\r\n\r\n`String rem = str.substring(0, i) + str.substring(i+1);` would also take O(n) time. This is because concatanating two strings takes O(m+n) time where m and n are the string lengths. Since the lengths always add up to n in this case, it would be a total of O(n).\r\n\r\nFinally, the actual call to `permutation` (not the recursion yet) and the `str.charAt(i)` statement would be done in constant time so O(1).\r\n\r\nHowever, what I am confused about is the fact that this is being done in a loop. In my book, the solution is explained as &quot;Each node in our call tree therefore corresponds to O(n) work&quot;. Wouldn&#39;t each node take O(n+n^2)=0(n^2) work since each iteration of the loop does O(n) work and it would be called n times?\r\n\r\n&gt;So after thinking through this a couple times, I have decided to rephrase my question more generally, how would you go about determining the time complexity for a function of this nature in a standardized manner (a method that can be applied to most if not all problems of this nature)? Although just reasoning through the situation works, it is also prone to misconceptions (as demonstrated by me) so is there a more general way to go about this?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3CPQz.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020392/runtime-for-function-with-loop-involving-recursive-calls","title":"Runtime for function with loop involving recursive calls"},{"tags":["javascript","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1621,"user_id":10112105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bde25775b18a1b447fee4f3944082a4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amaresh S M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112105/amaresh-s-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568941195,"post_id":58020391,"comment_id":102444210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020391/validating-form-on-submit-button#comment102444210_58020391"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":6684502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207004298289046/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jennifer Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6684502/jennifer-watson"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1621,"user_id":10112105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bde25775b18a1b447fee4f3944082a4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amaresh S M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112105/amaresh-s-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568942617,"post_id":58020391,"comment_id":102444467,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020391/validating-form-on-submit-button#comment102444467_58020391"},{"owner":{"reputation":1621,"user_id":10112105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bde25775b18a1b447fee4f3944082a4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amaresh S M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112105/amaresh-s-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568942905,"post_id":58020391,"comment_id":102444522,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020391/validating-form-on-submit-button#comment102444522_58020391"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":6684502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207004298289046/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jennifer Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6684502/jennifer-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569012019,"post_id":58020647,"comment_id":102471755,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020391/validating-form-on-submit-button/58020647#comment102471755_58020647"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1621,"user_id":10112105,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bde25775b18a1b447fee4f3944082a4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amaresh S M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112105/amaresh-s-m"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568942860,"creation_date":1568942860,"answer_id":58020647,"question_id":58020391,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020647","body_markdown":"To check the length of the username use `username.value.length`\r\n\r\n    if ((username.value == &quot;&quot;) &amp;&amp;

Opening the NuGet package manager confirms that. So I determined there\r\n&gt; must be a file git is ignoring that has a reference to the NuGet\r\n&gt; packages.\r\n\r\nDo you use the `Packages.config` format to manage nuget packages? \r\n\r\nI assume maybe your team [doesn&#39;t add this file into source control](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17153152/gitignore-nuget-packages-folder-at-any-level-but-include-targets-file-at-any-l).(Is this file in `.gitignore`?) \r\n\r\nIf so, since this file is used to manage nuget packages, no matter which branch you switch to, you&#39;ll always see the Nuget Package in UI.

So I created a new git branch where I could install the NuGet package and play around with it before merging back to my `dev` branch.\r\n\r\nSo I installed the NuGet package and it showed up in the References drop down of my project. Perfect. But now when I switch back to my `dev` branch the NuGet references are still there, even though the NuGet packages are definitely not installed. Opening the NuGet package manager confirms that.\r\n\r\nI have merged nothing back from my new branch, so the references should not be there. So I determined there must be a file git is ignoring that has a reference to the NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nSo I tried deleting everything in my repo but my .vs and .git folders and then doing a git reset --hard to bring back only what git knows about and voila, the references are gone in my dev branch. Moving back to my other branch brings them back (as it should), but also means they come back again when I switch to `dev` again. Everything builds properly, I just want to understand why things are showing up that shouldn&#39;t be, and how to make them go away when they shouldn&#39;t be there.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve basically just moved on at this point. The branch I was working on has since been merged in to `dev` so it isn&#39;t an issue... not that this really &#39;solves&#39; the underlying problem, but I&#39;ve decided it wasn&#39;t worth the little time I have to keep looking in to it.\r\n\r\nTo answer questions that came up:\r\n\r\nYes, everything was committed and synced before switching branches and no, there were no records of the NuGet package in the `dev` branch at all.\r\nWe were using the Packages.config file, and it was committed to git, but it was empty. Until I added this package we had no NuGet packages installed.

Leak is Just a Sideshow\r\n\r\nThere should be no leak at all. The correct things are being deallocated and the error is in one thing being allocated unnecessarily.\r\n\r\nLook at how `m_noOfSubjects` is used after the array has been allocated:\r\n\r\n    read(*Sch.m_noOfSubjects, 2, 50, &quot;Invalid Number of subjects, 2&lt;=ENTRY&lt;=50\\nRedo Entry: &quot;);\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    Sch.m_subjects = new int[*Sch.m_noOfSubjects];\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; *Sch.m_noOfSubjects; i++) \r\n\r\nAll use exactly one value: the very first. This is not the behaviour of an array. This is the behaviour of a single `int`.\r\n\r\n`m_noOfSubjects` should not be a pointer to an array or an `int` or anything like that. It should just be a dumb, ol&#39; `int`.\r\n\r\nIn `School`&#39;s definition, replace \r\n\r\n    int * m_noOfSubjects;\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n    int m_noOfSubjects;\r\n\r\nthen remove the allocation \r\n\r\n    Sch.m_noOfSubjects = new int[50];\r\n\r\nand finally eliminate all of the dereferences. eg\r\n\r\n    read(*Sch.m_noOfSubjects, 2, 50, &quot;Invalid Number of subjects, 2&lt;=ENTRY&lt;=50\\nRedo Entry: &quot;);\r\n         ^ remove\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    Sch.m_subjects = new int[*Sch.m_noOfSubjects];\r\n                             ^ remove\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; *Sch.m_noOfSubjects; i++) \r\n                        ^ remove\r\n\r\n#Thought process  on tracking and avoiding memory leaks (original answer)\r\nThe report says one block of 200 bytes is lost. You can look though your code for where you allocate 200 bytes and investigate more closely. For example, if `int` is 32 bit, `Sch.m_noOfSubjects = new int[50];` fits the bill 32 bits = 4 bytes. 4*50 = 200.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s follow `m_noOfSubjects` through and make sure it is correctly managed.\r\n\r\n*one &lt;kbd&gt;CTRL&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;F&lt;/kbd&gt; later...*\r\n\r\nSure enough I cannot find a `delete` of `m_noOfSubjects` anywhere in the given code.\r\n\r\nHow do we fix this? [`std::vector&lt;int&gt;`][1] should be the go to for handling a problem like this. `vector` looks after all of the resource management for you from allocating to deallocating and throws in correctly handling copying and assignment at the same time. \r\n\r\nThat said, I suspect what this assignment is supposed to teach you is [RAII][3]. In that case what you want to do is add a constructor and a destructor (and a copy constructor and an assignment operator as well because [if you need a destructor, you almost always need special code to handle copying][2]) to the `School` class. Don&#39;t allocate `School`&#39;s resources in some `read` free function that doesn&#39;t give a damn about the health and well being of the `School` class. `School` should look out for itself by allocating storage in its constructor or in its own input method. Later, the the destructor guarantees that all of `School`&#39;s resources are freed as soon as a `School` goes out of scope. All you have to so is make sure the `School` goes out of scope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4172722/what-is-the-rule-of-three\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2321511/what-is-meant-by-resource-acquisition-is-initialization-raii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020374/memmory-heap-and-leak-summary/58020497#58020497","title":"Memmory heap and leak summary"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10970196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e790f9299bfffb361661bad04bdd3357?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nightingale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10970196/nightingale"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10970196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e790f9299bfffb361661bad04bdd3357?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nightingale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10970196/nightingale"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568944500,"creation_date":1568940065,"last_edit_date":1568944500,"question_id":58020374,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020374","body_markdown":"I am submitting my school workshop through matrix and I am getting this warning about memory leak, however, when I compile it and run through the g++ command or VS, it does not show any warnings or errors.\r\n\r\nThat is the beginning of the submission\r\n\r\n    Checking due date:\r\n    ON TIME.\r\n    \r\n    Compiling:\r\n    g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o ws utils.o School.cpp schoolTester.cpp Subject.cpp utils.cpp 2&gt;

I&#39;m doing like a pricing page. User checks plan (radio), some addons (checkbox), selects budget(via range slider).

Now with those I need to add what user has selected from above.\r\n\r\nLike for an example:\r\nCode for the name field\r\n\r\n                      &lt;label for=&quot;name&quot;&gt;Name: &lt;span&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;\r\n                    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;message_name&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo esc_attr($_POST[&#39;message_name&#39;]); ?&gt;&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\nNow thing is, checkbox, radios, range slider have values\r\n \r\n\r\n    &lt;input  type=&quot;checkbox&quot;  id=&quot;addOnoption3&quot; name=&quot;message_addondata&quot; value=&quot;2500&quot; data-label=&quot;Feature 1&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nand email form field for this would be like this\r\n\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;message_addondata&quot; value=&quot;&lt;?php echo esc_attr($_POST[&#39;message_addondata&#39;]); ?&gt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, value is entered manually as starting one. To send it, inside value field i have to use something different like in an example above.\r\n\r\nNever done this, and can&#39;t figure it out, basically how to combine these two so value remains and changes (on range slider) but still use variable with $_POST to &quot;detect and send it in email&quot;.\r\nCheers\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020330/wp-contact-form-pick-and-send-selected-values","title":"Wp Contact Form - pick and send selected values"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3025,"user_id":1057102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f1412fdce8dc8873cf8b5590501faf7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sleblanc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1057102/sleblanc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568941205,"post_id":58020326,"comment_id":102444212,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020326/turning-python-output-into-string-variable-using-exec#comment102444212_58020326"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3025,"user_id":1057102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f1412fdce8dc8873cf8b5590501faf7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sleblanc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1057102/sleblanc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568941307,"post_id":58020423,"comment_id":102444231,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020326/turning-python-output-into-string-variable-using-exec/58020423#comment102444231_58020423"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5775,"user_id":3926995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2l63X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chiheb Nexus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926995/chiheb-nexus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5775,"user_id":3926995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2l63X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chiheb Nexus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926995/chiheb-nexus"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568940993,"last_edit_date":1568940993,"creation_date":1568940583,"answer_id":58020423,"question_id":58020326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020423","body_markdown":"Actually `contextlib` provides a context manager that capture the `stdout` of your code called `redirect_stdout`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n    import io\r\n    from contextlib import redirect_stdout\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    func_str = &#39;print(3)&#39;\r\n    stdout = io.StringIO()\r\n    with redirect_stdout(stdout):\r\n        exec(func_str)\r\n    \r\n    out = stdout.getvalue()\r\n    print(out, out.strip() == &#39;3&#39;)\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    3\r\n     True\r\n\r\n**PS:** The code is inspired from [contextlib.redirect_stdout](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html#contextlib.redirect_stdout) documentation code example.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020326/turning-python-output-into-string-variable-using-exec/58020423#58020423","title":"turning python output into string variable using exec()"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10082876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eT6HW_0W1Vw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABqs/E_ZLYd9SdMQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Elan Rosen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10082876/elan-rosen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1097,"user_id":9534184,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"nassim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9534184/nassim"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568940993,"creation_date":1568939556,"last_edit_date":1568940299,"question_id":58020326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020326","body_markdown":"I want to turn python output into string variable using exec()\r\n\r\nSomething like this is the goal:\r\n```\r\ncode = &quot;print(3)&quot;\r\n\r\nstring = exec(code) # string should then equal 3\r\n```\r\nSorry if this was repeated.

have a SQL database with a table containing a list of paid fines. One php page selects the elements from that table and displays them, with an added &quot;Approve/Decline&quot; button at the end of each row where the user can press to edit the value of the &quot;payStat&quot; variable. I also have a hidden value that should pass the &quot;fineID&quot; variable to the second page in order to complete the edit of the row with that same fineID.\r\n\r\nThe second php page should pass the fineID value in a hidden field, which is used to select the chosen row for editing. The text field is where the user can add a new value for the &quot;payStat&quot; variable in order for them to approve or decline the payment. However, the fineID is not transferring to the second page, and no updates to that row are made.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried passing &quot;fineID&quot; as a hidden variable in the first page so it&#39;ll appear on the 2nd page to carry out SQL queries.

through the python documentation, an oddity was found.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# -*- coding: ascii -*-\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code is supposed to set the encoding format as ASCII for the rest of the file.\r\n\r\nNow the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#encoding-declarations) says that:\r\n\r\n&gt; If a comment in the first or second line of the Python script matches the regular expression coding[=:]\\s*([-\\w.]+), this comment is processed as an encoding declaration; the first group of this expression names the encoding of the source code file. The encoding declaration must appear on a line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line. The recommended forms of an encoding expression are\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; `# -*- coding: &lt;encoding-name&gt; -*-`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; which is recognized also by GNU Emacs, and\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; `# vim:fileencoding=&lt;encoding-name&gt;`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; which is recognized by Bram Moolenaar’s VIM.\r\n\r\n*The encoding declaration must appear on a line of its own. If it is the second line, the first line must also be a comment-only line.*\r\n\r\nWe tested that, adding blank lines before the encoding &quot;comment&quot;. As expected, the encoding didn&#39;t happen.\r\n\r\nJust above in the documentation, we can find: *Comments are ignored by the syntax.*\r\n\r\nI have a hard time understanding how these two pieces of information can work together, as for me they contradict each other directly.\r\n\r\nIt also strikes me as something very odd. If I wanted to change a sort of setting for a piece of code, I&#39;d expect to use some kind of constant, or modify the root object, something like this.\r\n\r\nSo my question is:\r\n\r\nIs this the only occurence of using comments as meaningful in the python syntax? Where does this behaviour come from? Why was this chosen?\r\n\r\nThe way I previously understood it is that the editor sets the encoding. The editor can look up comments, so it made sense to me.

But as the program finishes, the vector is storing more directions than it should, including from other paths. \r\n\r\nWhat kind of rule can I make so it only stores the directions from the path it takes calculates directly from origin to destiny?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntuple &lt;vector&lt;int&gt;, int, double&gt; Djikstra::dijkstra(int orig, int dest)\r\n{\r\n    time_t start, end;\r\n    time(&amp;start);\r\n    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);\r\n\r\n    vector&lt;int&gt; directions;\r\n    int dist[V];\r\n    int visitted[V];\r\n\r\n    priority_queue &lt; tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt;,\r\n            vector&lt;tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt; &gt;, greater&lt;tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt; &gt; &gt; pq;\r\n\r\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; V; i++)\r\n    {\r\n        dist[i] = INFINITE;\r\n        visitted[i] = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    dist[orig] = 0;\r\n\r\n    pq.push(make_tuple(dist[orig], orig, orig));\r\n\r\n    while(!pq.empty())\r\n    {\r\n        tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt; p = pq.top();\r\n        int u = get&lt;1&gt;(p);\r\n        pq.pop(); // remove da fila\r\n\r\n        if(visitted[u] == false)\r\n        {\r\n            visitted[u] = true;\r\n\r\n            list&lt;tuple&lt;int, int, int&gt; &gt;::iterator it;\r\n\r\n            for(it = adj[u].begin(); it != adj[u].end(); it++)\r\n            {\r\n                int v = get&lt;0&gt;(*it);\r\n                int edge_cost = get&lt;1&gt;(*it);\r\n                int direction = get&lt;2&gt;(*it);\r\n\r\n                if(dist[v] &gt; (dist[u] + edge_cost))\r\n                {\r\n                    //directions.push_back(direction); //This is the line I used \r\n                    dist[v] = dist[u] + edge_cost;\r\n                    pq.push(make_tuple(dist[v], v, v));\r\n                }\r\n\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    time(&amp;end);\r\n    double time_taken = double(end - start);\r\n    return make_tuple(directions, dist[dest], time_taken);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring a test with a pre-set Adjacency List. The output of the vector of directions calculated should be 2 directions, I got 5 positions instead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020267/i-need-help-finding-out-how-to-save-the-directions-properly-from-a-turple-in-a-d","title":"I need help finding out how to save the directions properly from a turple in a Djikstra Algorithm"},{"tags":["java","hibernate"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":6400807,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29b7f0c0b4e7a6dc9a50b81a5b947d1e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6400807","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6400807/user6400807"},"last_editor":{"reputation":325,"user_id":6298537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QrLr3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yashjain12yj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6298537/yashjain12yj"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568962405,"creation_date":1568938952,"last_edit_date":1568962405,"question_id":58020265,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020265","body_markdown":"I have an entity with id, case_id, name, address, created, created_by columns.\r\n\r\nI am using @namednativequery, @sqlresultsetmapping, @entity, and @entityresult and getting 4 columns.  \r\n \r\n    @EntityResult(entityClass = com.hhs.entity.CaseEvent.class,\r\n      fields = { @FieldResult(name = &quot;id&quot;, column = &quot;id&quot;),\r\n\t     @FieldResult(name = &quot;caseid&quot;, column = &quot;case_id&quot;),\r\n\t     @FieldResult(name = &quot;created&quot;, column = &quot;created&quot;),\r\n\t     @FieldResult(name = &quot;createdby&quot;, column = &quot;created_by&quot;)\r\n\t  } ) } )\r\n\r\nBut the application fails with the following error.\r\n\r\n    2019-09-19 19:13:51.523 ERROR 15888 --- [nio-8080-exec-5] o.a.c.c.C.[.[.[/].[dispatcherServlet]    : Servlet.service() for servlet [dispatcherServlet] in context with path [] threw exception [Request processing failed; nested exception is org.springframework.dao.InvalidDataAccessResourceUsageException: could not execute query; SQL [SELECT id, case_id, created, created_by FROM hhs.case_event]; nested exception is org.hibernate.exception.SQLGrammarException: could not execute query] with root cause \r\n\t\torg.postgresql.util.PSQLException: The column name created_3_9_0_ was not \r\n\t\tfound in this ResultSet.\r\n        at org.postgresql.jdbc.PgResultSet.findColumn(PgResultSet.java:2593) ~ [postgresql-42.2.5.jar!/:42.2.5]\r\n        at org.postgresql.jdbc.PgResultSet.getString(PgResultSet.java:2467) ~[postgresql-42.2.5.jar!/:42.2.5]\r\n        at com.zaxxer.hikari.pool.HikariProxyResultSet.getString(HikariProxyResultSet.java) ~[HikariCP-3.2.0.jar!/:na]\r\n        at  org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.VarcharTypeDescriptor$2.doExtract(VarcharTypeDescriptor.java:62) ~[hibernate-core-5.3.7.Final.jar!/:5.3.7.Final]\r\n        at org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.BasicExtractor.extract(BasicExtractor.java:47) ~[hibernate-core-5.3.7.Final.jar!/:5.3.7.Final]\r\n        at org.hibernate.type.AbstractStandardBasicType.nullSafeGet(AbstractStandardBasicType.java:261) ~[hibernate-core-5.3.7.Final.jar!/:5.3.7.Final]\r\n        at org.hibernate.type.AbstractStandardBasicType.nullSafeGet(AbstractStandardBasicType.java:257) ~[hibernate-core-5.3.7.Final.jar!/:5.3.7.Final]\r\n        at org.hibernate.type.AbstractStandardBasicType.nullSafeGet(AbstractStandardBasicType.java:247) ~[hibernate-core-5.3.7.Final.jar!/:5.3.7.Final]\r\n        at org.hibernate.type.AbstractStandardBasicType.hydrate(AbstractStandardBasicType.java:333) ~[hibernate-core-5.3\r\n   \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020265/hibernate-jpa-sql-column-name-issues","title":"Hibernate JPA SQL column name issues"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31925,"user_id":2341603,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZTHIr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Obsidian Age","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2341603/obsidian-age"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1568939631,"post_id":58020264,"comment_id":102443984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020264/creating-a-website-that-displays-flashcards#comment102443984_58020264"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":8334663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0jW47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8334663/sao"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568940245,"creation_date":1568940245,"answer_id":58020389,"question_id":58020264,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58020389","body_markdown":"Hello and welcome to StackOverflow.

There&#39;s no need to restart Simulators or Xcode to make in-app purchases work anymore.\r\n\r\nI had submitted an app for review and it was rejected because of that particular error. As it turns out, it was rejected for a stupid reason as it wasn&#39;t my app&#39;s bug, however I spent hours trying to get around it.\r\n\r\nSo, just update to Xcode 11.1 GM Seed and run again. Everything will be okay.\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nThe issue still exists in Xcode 11.1 and apparently I was just lucky that it didn&#39;t happen to me again. However, I had a second rejection for the exact same reason. *What eventually worked* and made my app get approved was this:\r\n\r\n*I had to update my IAP record on App Store by editing and saving it again.*\r\n\r\nSo, I recommend you to try the same; change something temporarily in your IAPs, save and then revert your changes (and save again) so records on the App Store to be refreshed.\r\n\r\nFYI, after the second rejection Apple invalidated my IAP and therefore showed me the way. It looks like to be a known issue to them at the end.\r\n\r\nFor details [read this discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/dbw5b8/my_experience_on_having_my_app_rejected_twice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) I wrote on Reddit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020258/requesting-an-in-app-purchase-in-ios-13-fails/58121770#58121770","title":"Requesting an In App Purchase in iOS 13 fails"}],"owner":{"reputation":79,"user_id":11161030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfed660fea69201963d5fed6e6b3c555?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Timothy C.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11161030/timothy-c"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264475,"user_id":1226963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yjY1E.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rmaddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226963/rmaddy"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":779,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":13,"accepted_answer_id":58065711,"answer_count":3,"score":13,"last_activity_date":1570864946,"creation_date":1568938880,"last_edit_date":1568939343,"question_id":58020258,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020258","body_markdown":"I use `SwiftyStoreKit` to request In App Purchases and get only this error with iOS 13:\r\n\r\n    Error: Optional(Error Domain=ASDErrorDomain Code=507 &quot;Error decoding object&quot; UserInfo={NSLocalizedDescription=Error decoding object, NSLocalizedFailureReason=Attempted to decode store response})\r\n\r\nI cannot request information about the products, nor make purchases with a sand box account.

If I manually edit the script to quote the constraint name, the statement is correctly parsed and the table is altered, adding the primary key:\r\n```\r\nalter table MY_SCHEMA.FOO_1234_ACTION\r\n   add constraint &quot;1234_ACTION_PK&quot; primary key (MY_ID)\r\n/\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand that maybe the name could simply be changed but I&#39;m trying to establish a baseline from the schema we have in order to iterate it to what it needs to be.\r\n\r\nI have looked in both the options for the Oracle database definition as well as the options on the model itself that might influence script output (such as naming conventions). Is there any way to cause PowerDesigner to, in the case of object names with leading digits, emit the name with quotes but leaving all other names alone?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020245/when-exporting-a-sql-script-how-do-i-conditionally-quote-object-names-that-begi","title":"When exporting a SQL script, how do I conditionally quote object names that begin with a digit?"},{"tags":["google-cloud-platform","deep-learning","gpu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":10161872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/owbi0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bernardo Villasenor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10161872/bernardo-villasenor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569465266,"post_id":58020244,"comment_id":102607778,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020244/slower-training-on-google-cloud-tesla-k80-than-on-local-laptop-machine#comment102607778_58020244"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12092968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1e575393f18bd26b89a81caac776003?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SmoresG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092968/smoresg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568938749,"creation_date":1568938749,"question_id":58020244,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020244","body_markdown":"Similar unanswered question here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44939323/why-vgpu-tesla-k80-on-google-cloud-slower-than-gtx940m-on-t460p\r\n\r\nI developed a segmentation network on my laptop, which has an nvidia GTX 1070 8GB.

I also rather not have to reach to my mouse. This is partly motivated by the fact that selection with Ctrl-Space (Emacs-style) doesn&#39;t seem to work when IPython is run within the VS-code terminal window (if you could solve that, that&#39;ll be a step). But also I am more used to use Shift-Left/Right in Windows. Note: I&#39;m referring here to the IPython-text based shell; not Jupyter/notebooks.\r\n\r\nReading the IPython docs, I found that I could modify the key bindings, which are based on prompt_toolkit. So I tried using the simple example in the doc, which maps a key to printing a silly message, and just changed the key to Shift-Left (s-left):\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom IPython import get_ipython\r\nfrom prompt_toolkit.enums import DEFAULT_BUFFER\r\nfrom prompt_toolkit.filters import HasFocus, HasSelection, ViInsertMode, EmacsInsertMode\r\n\r\nip = get_ipython()\r\ninsert_mode = ViInsertMode() | EmacsInsertMode()\r\n\r\ndef insert_unexpected(event):\r\n    buf = event.current_buffer\r\n    buf.insert_text(&#39;The Spanish Inquisition&#39;)\r\n\r\n# Register the shortcut if IPython is using prompt_toolkit\r\nif getattr(ip, &#39;pt_app&#39;, None):\r\n    registry = ip.pt_app.key_bindings\r\n    registry.add_binding(&#39;s-left&#39;,\r\n                     filter=(HasFocus(DEFAULT_BUFFER) &amp; ~HasSelection() &amp; insert_mode))(insert_unexpected)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, nothing happens. After running the above in IPython, Shift-Left still simply moves the cursor to the left. If I put say &#39;c-n&#39; (for Ctrl-N) instead of &#39;s-left&#39; above, the result is as expected and the message gets printed.\r\n\r\nIs there a special trick to use to map the Shift-Left/Right keys? Of course, the next step will then to actually activate the selection mode etc. Maybe somebody has actually defined Windows-style prompt-toolkit bindings? (selection with Shift-arrows, cut/copy/paste with Ctrl-X/C/V). Any help appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020241/how-to-bind-shift-left-right-in-ipython-to-trigger-selection","title":"How to bind Shift-Left/Right in IPython to trigger selection"},{"tags":["php","mysql","sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":622,"user_id":2223967,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/911e9d48c2f678f0180fb39f5ef8e630?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mohd Alomar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2223967/mohd-alomar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568938989,"post_id":58020240,"comment_id":102443865,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020240/how-to-determine-time-stamps-which-are-more-than-5-minutes-on-mysql#comment102443865_58020240"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11892317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8a5ANqH5Yv4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfe2hT3HCHM2BZvHYEilfI_6IVpTw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"maria mae","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892317/maria-mae"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":622,"user_id":2223967,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/911e9d48c2f678f0180fb39f5ef8e630?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mohd Alomar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2223967/mohd-alomar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568939088,"post_id":58020240,"comment_id":102443883,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020240/how-to-determine-time-stamps-which-are-more-than-5-minutes-on-mysql#comment102443883_58020240"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11892317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8a5ANqH5Yv4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfe2hT3HCHM2BZvHYEilfI_6IVpTw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"maria mae","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892317/maria-mae"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3724,"user_id":372172,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e3e64f71bb0a748cffdf0baec8b95cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Koala Yeung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372172/koala-yeung"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568947414,"creation_date":1568938685,"last_edit_date":1568947414,"question_id":58020240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020240","body_markdown":"I have a sql data with bann_time and bann_lift rows\r\n\r\nHere are my variables \r\n\r\n```php\r\n$time = date(&#39;H:i&#39;);\r\n$endTime = date(&quot;H:i&quot;,time() + 300);\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I post this datas on my php for example \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]](https://prnt.sc/p8gx8t)\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I use if statement to know if 5 mins have pass?\r\n\r\n```php\r\nif($sql_start &gt;

   arr = [4, 1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 1, 3, 4, 3, 4] \r\n\r\nYou can use the form of [Hash::new](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.6.3/Hash.html#method-c-new) that takes an argument, called its *default value* (which often, as here, is zero), to obtain the frequency of the elements of `arr`:\r\n\r\n    freq = arr.each_with_object(Hash.new(0)) { |n,h| h[n] += 1 }\r\n      #=&gt; {4=&gt;4, 1=&gt;2, 3=&gt;3, 2=&gt;1,

All that means is that if `freq` does not have a key `k`, `freq[k]` returns zero (and that does not alter `freq`).\r\n\r\nHere are solutions to two possible interpretations of your question.
