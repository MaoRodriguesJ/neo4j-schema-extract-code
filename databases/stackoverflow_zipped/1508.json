or &quot;description&quot; (just one of each, never both) and since it was already on API I was denied, so in that case I wanted it to fall into error handling which would list all the items on API that relates to it and find the &quot;name&quot; or &quot;description&quot;  which I wanted to create in the first place, get its ID and use that on other steps which need the ID to use for its own creations.\r\n\r\nI simply avoided using RegEx by getting a response from API in json and search trough that with for loop.

Note, for your setup to work, you might need to run `reset_index` one on the original Dataframe df (otherwise it&#39;s like your sample from Dataframe)\r\n\r\nNext we create a Dataframe that apps meals to items via\r\n```\r\nflattend_orders = pd.merge(df[[&quot;order_id&quot;, &quot;order_type&quot;]], \r\n         flattened_items[[&quot;level_0&quot;,&quot;order_item&quot;, &quot;item_count&quot;]],\r\nleft_index=True, right_on=&quot;level_0&quot;).drop(&quot;level_0&quot;, axis=1)\r\n\r\nmeal_dct = {&quot;Breakfast&quot;: breakfastMenu, &quot;Lunch&quot;: lunchMenu, &quot;Dinner&quot;: dinnerMenu}\r\n\r\nmeal_df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(meal_dct, orient=&quot;index&quot;).stack().reset_index(\r\n).drop(&quot;level_1&quot;, axis=1).rename(columns={&quot;level_0&quot;: &quot;Meal&quot;, 0: &quot;Item&quot;})\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich looks like\r\n```\r\nprint(meal_df.head())\r\n        Meal     Item\r\n0  Breakfast  Pancake\r\n1  Breakfast   Coffee\r\n2  Breakfast     Eggs\r\n3  Breakfast   Cereal\r\n4      Lunch    Steak\r\n```\r\nNow, we can just do an inner join on the `order_type` and `order_item`\r\n```\r\nmerged = pd.merge(flattend_orders, meal_df, left_on=[&quot;order_type&quot;, &quot;order_item&quot;],\r\nright_on=[&quot;Meal&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;]).drop([&quot;Meal&quot;, &quot;Item&quot;], axis=1)\r\n```\r\nand we obtain\r\n```\r\n    order_id order_type  order_item  item_count\r\n0  ORDB10489      Lunch       Salad          10\r\n1  ORDB10489      Lunch     Chicken           8\r\n2  ORDK04121      Lunch     Chicken           5\r\n3  ORDZ00319     Dinner  Fish&amp;Chips           9\r\n4  ORDB00980     Dinner  Fish&amp;Chips          10\r\n5  ORDZ00319     Dinner       Pasta           5\r\n6  ORDB00980     Dinner       Pasta           6\r\n7  ORDY10003  Breakfast      Coffee           2\r\n8  ORDY10003  Breakfast      Cereal           1\r\n9  ORDK04121      Lunch       Steak           9\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, this is maybe already good enough, but you might prefer to have a list of tuples back. To this end:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmerged.groupby([&quot;order_id&quot;, &quot;order_type&quot;]).apply(lambda x: list(zip(x[&quot;order_item&quot;], \r\nx[&quot;item_count&quot;]))).reset_index().rename(columns={0:&quot;order_items&quot;})\r\n```\r\ngives\r\n```\r\n    order_id order_type                     order_items\r\n0  ORDB00980     Dinner  [(Fish&amp;Chips, 10), (Pasta, 6)]\r\n1  ORDB10489      Lunch     [(Salad, 10), (Chicken, 8)]\r\n2  ORDK04121      Lunch      [(Chicken, 5), (Steak, 9)]\r\n3  ORDY10003  Breakfast      [(Coffee, 2), (Cereal, 1)]\r\n4  ORDZ00319     Dinner   [(Fish&amp;Chips, 9), (Pasta, 5)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the ugliness here is due to converting data from (maybe) insufficient formats. Also all for loops and apples just come from data transformation.\r\n\r\nEssentially, my answer can be summarized as:\r\n```\r\npd.merge(df, df_meal)\r\n```\r\nif we assume just the right data format.\r\nBtw, I just chose `item_count` as a name as a best guess.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183488/checking-for-sting-in-pandas-column-and-modifying-another/58188619#58188619","title":"checking for sting in pandas column and modifying another"}],"owner":{"reputation":130,"user_id":11972802,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78d49f97690bc27ab2296909c3b53d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11972802/leena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":130,"user_id":11972802,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78d49f97690bc27ab2296909c3b53d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11972802/leena"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58183727,"answer_count":4,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569973257,"creation_date":1569927781,"last_edit_date":1569973257,"question_id":58183488,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183488","body_markdown":"I am working on cleaning a dataframe. The dataframe contains three columns `order_id` `&#39;order_item&#39;` and `&#39;order_type`. The order type can be: breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I want to compare each item in the order to confirm it matches the order type. If not, I would like to drop the tuple that contains the wrong item.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe menus are as follow:\r\n\r\n    breakfastMenu=[&#39;Pancake&#39;, &#39;Coffee&#39;, &#39;Eggs&#39;, &#39;Cereal&#39;]\r\n    dinnerMenu=[&#39;Salmon&#39;, &#39;Fish&amp;Chips&#39;, &#39;Pasta&#39;, &#39;Shrimp&#39;]\r\n    lunchMenu=[&#39;Steak&#39;, &#39;Fries&#39;, &#39;Burger&#39;, &#39;Chicken&#39;, &#39;Salad&#39;]\r\n\r\nFor example you can see in the first line, the **lunch** order contains **coffee** which is not correct. And **dinner** include **Egg**.\r\n\r\nsample of the dataframe:\r\n\r\n        order_id\torder_type\torder_items\r\n    0    ORDB10489\tLunch\t     [(&#39;Coffee&#39;, 4), (&#39;Salad&#39;, 10), (&#39;Chicken&#39;, 8)]\r\n    1    ORDZ00319\tDinner\t     [(&#39;Fish&amp;Chips&#39;, 9), (&#39;Pasta&#39;, 5), (&#39;Eggs&#39;, 3)]\r\n    2   ORDB00980\tDinner\t     [(&#39;Pasta&#39;, 6), (&#39;Fish&amp;Chips&#39;, 10)]\r\n    3    ORDY10003\tBreakfast\t [(&#39;Coffee&#39;, 2), (&#39;Cereal&#39;, 1)]\r\n    4   ORDK04121\tLunch\t     [(&#39;Steak&#39;, 9), (&#39;Chicken&#39;, 5)]\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have enough experience with pandas data frames. But my idea is to create a `for loop` with `if conditions`. The loop will compare the first item in each `tuple` to the `order_type` and the corresponding **menu list**. If the item is not in the corresponding list the tuple will be dropped.\r\n\r\nThis draft code is just a beginning but it is similar to what I want to achieve:\r\n\r\n    if dirtyData[&#39;order_type&#39;].str.contains(&#39;Breakfast&#39;).any()\\\r\n            and eval(dirtyData[&#39;order_items&#39;][0])[0][0] not in breakfastMenu:\r\n                print(dirtyData[&#39;order_id&#39;]) \r\n\r\n*I add `eval` to convert the list of tuples from a string to a list.*\r\n\r\nany input is appreciated \r\nThank you,\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183488/checking-for-sting-in-pandas-column-and-modifying-another","title":"checking for sting in pandas column and modifying another"},{"tags":["mysql","vb.net","web-services","mysqlconnection"],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6696728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1400489003311774/picture?type=large","display_name":"Med Mehdi Mahdar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6696728/med-mehdi-mahdar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9541,"user_id":832052,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kEUsS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"djv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/832052/djv"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569939769,"creation_date":1569927766,"last_edit_date":1569939769,"question_id":58183486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183486","body_markdown":"We are moving from an SIT Database to the production Database, after deploying the vb web services I figured out that the MysqlCommands are not filling my Dataset in certain cases and it gives error &quot;The given key was not present int he dictionary&quot;.\r\n\r\nEverything just works fine the SIT Environment but when we get to the production!\r\n\r\nThe dataset is not receiving the records when the query contains columns that don&#39;t have a charset&amp;Collation value like the date columns.  \r\nWhich means a query of `SELECT COUNT(*) from TableX` with one date column in TableX will give me an empty dataset\r\n\r\n```vb.net\r\nconn.ConnectionString = &quot;SERVER=&quot;

You may want to use [properties stored in a map](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/delegated-properties.html#storing-properties-in-a-map) to overcome the use of reflection.\r\n\r\nHere is an example using a type with 2 dates and 2 strings, both having a nullable and a non-null variant:\r\n\r\n    class YourData(internal val backedMap : Map&lt;String, Any?&gt;) {\r\n      val beginDate : Date by backedMap\r\n      val endDate : Date? by backedMap\r\n      val maybeString : String? by backedMap\r\n      val string : String by backedMap\r\n      constructor(beginDate : Date, string : String, endDate: Date? = null, maybeString : String? = null) : this(mapOf(\r\n          &quot;beginDate&quot; to beginDate,\r\n          &quot;endDate&quot; to endDate,\r\n          &quot;maybeString&quot; to maybeString,\r\n          &quot;string&quot; to string\r\n      ))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhile it may seem more complicated having that additional constructor in place, it just helps to easily create new objects the way you are most comfortable with.\r\n\r\nNow you can either supply that function I placed in the comment or any variant of it.

iOS, in Android you cannot schedule notifications **directly** using the OS Notifications API. Instead, you need to:  \r\n1 - Create an Alarm using the `AlarmManager` service.  \r\n2 - Handle the intent once Android OS fires it using a `BroadcastReceiver`.  \r\n3 - Show the notification using code similar to the one you posted in the question.    \r\n\r\nFrom your code, I am assuming that you are trying to use the method `setWhen` to establish when the notification should be shown. However, from the docs you can see that this method:\r\n\r\n\r\n     /**\r\n         * Set the time that the event occurred.

need to iterate through pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` of combinations of length 2, out of a list `l` of items, with the following constraints:\r\n\r\n1. no repetitions in pairs: if `(a, b)` already appeared, then `(b, a)` shall not be produced\r\n1. no repetitions between pairs, i.e., pairs must be considered only once: if `(a, b)`, `(c, d)` already appeared, then `(c, d)`, `(a, b)` shall not be produced\r\n1. the items in the two pairs must be different: `a != c and a != d and b != c and b != d`\r\n\r\nFor example, with \r\n\r\n`l = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]`\r\n\r\nThe pairs should be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(0, 1), (2, 3)\r\n(0, 1), (2, 4)\r\n(0, 1), (3, 4)\r\n\r\n(0, 2), (1, 3)\r\n(0, 2), (1, 4)\r\n(0, 2), (3, 4)\r\n\r\n(0, 3), (1, 2)\r\n(0, 3), (1, 4)\r\n(0, 3), (2, 4)\r\n\r\n(0, 4), (1, 2)\r\n(0, 4), (1, 3)\r\n(0, 4), (2, 3)\r\n\r\n(1, 2), (3, 4)\r\n(1, 3), (2, 4)\r\n(1, 4), (2, 3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI used integers in the example, however, I am interested in a more general-purpose solution (though the items are lists, in my specific case).\r\n\r\nThis is the solution I came up with:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport itertools\r\n\r\nused = set()\r\n\r\nfor (a, b) in itertools.combinations(l, 2):\r\n    used.add((a, b))\r\n    for (c, d) in itertools.combinations(l, 2):\r\n\t\tif a == c or a == d or b == c or b == d:\r\n\t\t\tcontinue\r\n\t\tif (c, d) in used:\r\n\t\t\tcontinue\r\n\t\t# do stuff...\r\n\t\tpass\r\n```\r\n\r\nApart from looking cumbersome, this solution requires the additional set `used`. In the actual implementation I used `enumerate(l)` instead of `l` and put the indexes of the items in the tuples in the set, and tried to use the indexes to filter the options sooner... but did not manage to make it any better.\r\n\r\nHow can I make it more efficient and, possibly, more elegant/Pythonic?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183448/most-efficient-way-of-producing-constrained-pairs-of-combinations-out-of-a-list","title":"Most efficient way of producing

I have one RecyclerView, with each cardview showing one image, two text views and one switch button. This app is for myself and I wanted to organize my card collection so the switch is there for letting me know if I have a card or not, so I wanted to update database with a 1, if it&#39;s checked, or with a 0 if it&#39;s not. I was trying to test the buttons with some Toast but I get an error.

Am I not allowed to import functions like this?\r\n\r\n`utils.js` exports the methods as,\r\n\r\n    module.exports = {\r\n        sendNotification,\r\n        addNotificationToDb\r\n    };\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\n    const addNotificationToDb = (userId, postId, type) =&gt; {\r\n      try {\r\n        const newNotification = new Notification({\r\n          userId,\r\n          postId,\r\n          typeOfNotification: type\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        newNotification.save();\r\n      } catch (err) {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Error saving notification&quot;, err);\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEdit 2:\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve figured out the culprit. `api/utils.js` requires models, several of which `/utils/utils.js` requires. So when `server.js` does `app.use(&#39;/api/utils)`, those models are required twice (at least I think that&#39;s the culprit). I figured this out by commenting out the model requires in `utils/utils.js`. How can I circumvent this? Is my only option to require the models in `api/utils` and just pass them individually to the methods that are imported from `utils/utils.js`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183380/app-keeps-crashing-when-requiring-helper-methods-from-a-different-module","title":"App keeps crashing when requiring helper methods from a different module"},{"tags":["android-fragments"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7713503,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-1NaI8e6yC2o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/vlmkDnZPnLo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hale nor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7713503/hale-nor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2369,"user_id":3118401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c066b73af214d8e7cf6b52f6ef75314a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marcolz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3118401/marcolz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569932521,"creation_date":1569927410,"last_edit_date":1569932521,"question_id":58183379,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183379","body_markdown":"I have a navigation activity that was replaced by fragment called home fragment and home replaced by **Add Fragment** and in Add fragment I have a tab view one tab is monthly data and other is upload image tab.

would like to use `PageView` in Flutter application to display bank cards.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that height of `PageView`&#39;s page is something like `match_parent` and fills almost whole screen, but I would like to match `Card`&#39;s height inside `PageView` - something like `wrap_content` in android&#39;s XML layouts.\r\n\r\n`Card` view contains:\r\n\r\n - `Text`- alias\r\n - `CardView` - card graphic\r\n\r\nBoth are placed in `Column` widget which is placed in `Container`.\r\n`Text` and `CardView` are with Blue background, `Container` is with Green background.\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@override\r\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n  return Container(\r\n    color: Colors.green,\r\n    child: Column(\r\n      mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,\r\n      children: [\r\n        Container(\r\n          color: Colors.blue,\r\n            child: Align(alignment: Alignment.centerLeft, child: Text(card.alias))),\r\n        Container(\r\n            color: Colors.blue,\r\n            child: AspectRatio(aspectRatio: 1.586, child: CardView(card: card))),\r\n      ],\r\n    ),\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![App layout preview][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd here is first problem. I am using `mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min` to wrap `Column` height but it is not working, so Green color is filling screen - but should be same height as Blue color.\r\n\r\nBecause single page is that high, so PageView is also too high.\r\n\r\n`PageView` is created with that code and `PageView` has Red background.:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nWidget buildPageView(BuildContext context, AsyncSnapshot&lt;List&lt;WalletCard&gt;&gt; cards) {\r\n  return PageView.builder(\r\n      physics: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics(),\r\n      controller: PageController(viewportFraction: 7 / 8),\r\n      itemCount: cards.data == null ? 0 : cards.data.length,\r\n      itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {\r\n        return Item(index: index, card: cards.data[index]);\r\n      });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand that method (`buildPageView`) is used to provide `Widget` inside `CardsPageView`. `CardsPageView` is placed on screen with this code:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@override\r\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n  return Container(\r\n      child: Column(\r\n        children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n          Flexible(\r\n              child: Container(\r\n                color: Colors.red,\r\n                child: CardsPageView(walletCards: cardViewModel.walletCards),\r\n              )),\r\n          RaisedButton(\r\n            onPressed: () {},\r\n            color: Colors.orange,\r\n            textColor: Colors.white,\r\n            child: Text(&#39;PAY&#39;),\r\n          ),\r\n        ],\r\n      ));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ym1xM.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183341/how-to-match-pageview-height-to-items-height","title":"How to match PageView height to items Height?"},{"tags":["java","eclipse","drools"],"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":2393517,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I4woT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Neil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2393517/neil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569927261,"creation_date":1569927261,"question_id":58183336,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183336","body_markdown":"Using Eclipse and the Drools plugin, with my JDK set to Amazon Coretto 11, I get the following single error on each drl\r\n\r\nvalue &#39;11&#39; is not a valid language level\r\n\r\nI have seen plenty of similar issues for Java 8, where the solution is to drop down to Java 7.\r\nE.g. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27603747/in-eclipse-it-is-showing-value-1-8-is-not-a-valid-language-level/27603790\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t see anything for Java 11 though, on here or Google.

The console log always writes out different state so I know the state is updated. I also tried `forceUpdate()` and adding a key (you can see the key in the code) but it doesn&#39;t help.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m at a loss here. Has anyone bumped into the same issue or can help? I also know there are several questions quite like this one but no one answered my questions so I had to write my own.\r\n\r\nI removed a lot of unrelated code here but basically I pass the props down

language is designed to separate your &quot;things&quot; (class fields and class properties) from how to use them (methods). However, certain things are just *syntactic sugar* that allows you to be more concise.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your code\r\n\r\n    Class Program\r\n    {\r\n        Dub obj=new Dub()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nis functionally (and semantically) equivalent to this\r\n\r\n    Class Program\r\n    {\r\n        Dub obj;\r\n\r\n        public Program()\r\n        {\r\n            obj = new Dub();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbecause it declares a field (`Dub obj` is the portion of code that does that) and then initializes it when it is constructed (` = new Dub()` is how you say that you want it initialized).\r\n\r\nYou may wonder why you have two ways to do the same things, but the point is that what you are writing in the initializer must be an *expression* that can be assigned to the field which is being initialized.\r\nIt is a constrained thing that you can use to have less code to write and review when things are easy. If that is not suitable, you can use the constructor, where you are free to do all the fancy things that are not allowed in the initializer.\r\n\r\nSimply put, *Instructions* are almost unconstrained statements that can be used inside methods. An *expression* is an instruction, but not vice versa. Initializers require *expressions* by design.\r\n\r\nFor more information on initializers, you can have a look at [Field MSDN documentation][1], where everything is explained with more details and samples.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/fields\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183298/why-object-assignment-is-not-allowed-in-a-class-outside-a-method/58184305#58184305","title":"Why object assignment is not allowed in a class outside a method"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":3977474,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcba7d3e1a327859f9604a0e98d18690?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abhay Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3977474/abhay-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":6,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58184305,"answer_count":2,"score":-5,"last_activity_date":1569932369,"creation_date":1569927106,"last_edit_date":1569932369,"question_id":58183298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183298","body_markdown":"In any c# class this is allowed \r\n\r\n    Class Program\r\n    {\r\n     Dub obj=new Dub()\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut not this\r\n\r\n    Class Program\r\n    {\r\n    Dub obj1= null;\r\n    Obj1=new Dub();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTry this in class only not in any function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183298/why-object-assignment-is-not-allowed-in-a-class-outside-a-method","title":"Why object assignment is not allowed in a class outside a method"},{"tags":["javascript","ajax","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":522,"user_id":4411297,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bac0fc34da57c7aec9313fb3e2e56798?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Daniel Gale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4411297/daniel-gale"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569931765,"post_id":58183297,"comment_id":102748539,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183297/why-is-my-ajax-request-repeating-same-data-from-laravel-controller#comment102748539_58183297"},{"owner":{"reputation":522,"user_id":4411297,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bac0fc34da57c7aec9313fb3e2e56798?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Daniel Gale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4411297/daniel-gale"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569932267,"post_id":58183297,"comment_id":102748806,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183297/why-is-my-ajax-request-repeating-same-data-from-laravel-controller#comment102748806_58183297"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12008828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88a14210fd381f63c9f90e40fd1473a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chilldsgn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12008828/chilldsgn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569930074,"post_id":58183835,"comment_id":102747668,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183297/why-is-my-ajax-request-repeating-same-data-from-laravel-controller/58183835#comment102747668_58183835"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":424,"user_id":6907339,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1473754669307496/picture?type=large","display_name":"rkg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6907339/rkg"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569929132,"creation_date":1569929132,"answer_id":58183835,"question_id":58183297,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58183835","body_markdown":"You should regenerate the pagination every time you make a request to get the correct data.

This means that you need to call `plot` twice in order to generate two curves. I put your data in a file called `data.csv` and wrote the following piece of code:\r\n\r\n    import numpy\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    \r\n    data = numpy.genfromtxt(&#39;data.csv&#39;)\r\n    starts = numpy.asarray(data[:, 0] == 0).nonzero()[0]\r\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1, num=0, figsize=(16, 8))\r\n    for i in range(starts.shape[0]):\r\n        if i == starts.shape[0] - 1:\r\n            ax.plot(data[starts[i]:, 0], data[starts[i]:, 1])\r\n        else:\r\n            ax.plot(data[starts[i]:starts[i + 1], 0],\r\n                    data[starts[i]:starts[i + 1], 1])\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\nwhich generates this figure\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhat I do with `starts` is that I look for the rows in the first column of data which contain the value 0, which I consider to be the start of a new curve. The loop then generates a curve at each iteration. The `if` statement discerns between the last curve and the other ones. There is probably more elegant, but it works.\r\n\r\nAlso, do not import pylab, it is discouraged because of the unnecessary filling of the namespace. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SPlqP.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183296/how-to-plot-graph-from-file-using-python-problem-of-the-junction-of-lines/58211440#58211440","title":"How to plot graph from file using Python, problem of the junction of lines"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12146102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBUu6PG2G54WN3luho0rqBIfeXS25yk6sSi7vkI8A=k-s128","display_name":"al ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12146102/al-ahmed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12146102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBUu6PG2G54WN3luho0rqBIfeXS25yk6sSi7vkI8A=k-s128","display_name":"al ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12146102/al-ahmed"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58211440,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570075151,"creation_date":1569927102,"last_edit_date":1570064463,"question_id":58183296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183296","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to python and have a question.

have a Cocoa app that uses `AVAudioBuffer` and `AVAudioFormat` to read sample data from an audio file. However I am confused about the interleaved property of `AVAudioFormat`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code (Xamarin, but that should not be relevant). `_file` is an instance of `AVAudioFile`.\r\n\r\n    using (var format = new AVAudioFormat(AVAudioCommonFormat.PCMFloat32, _file.FileFormat.SampleRate, channelCount, interleaved: true))\r\n    using (var buffer = new AVAudioPcmBuffer(format, checked((uint)frameCount)))\r\n    {\r\n        _file.ReadIntoBuffer(buffer, out var error);\r\n\r\n        Span&lt;float&gt; span;\r\n        unsafe\r\n        {\r\n            var bufferPointer = (float*)Marshal.ReadIntPtr(buffer.FloatChannelData);\r\n            span = new Span&lt;float&gt;(bufferPointer, (int)(frameCount * channelCount));\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return span.ToArray();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo the critical part of this is the interleaved value passed to the constructor of `AVAudioFormat`. When it is true (as above), the `FloatChannelData` in the buffer is all zeros. When it is false, the sample data is present as expected.\r\n\r\nI am confused as I assumed that the interleaved value specified the required format of the data in the buffer. My attempts to locate documentation that explains its role have not been successful.\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain the role of interleaved, how I should decide the value to use, and why, when it is true, the sample data is all zero.\r\n\r\nThere is clearly some learning to do here, so if you can point me to some official (or otherwise) documentation that explains this I&#39;d be grateful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183264/avaudiobuffer-and-avaudioformat-setting-interleaved-to-true-produces-zero-value","title":"AVAudioBuffer and AVAudioFormat, setting interleaved to true produces zero value sample data"},{"tags":["twitter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12531,"user_id":1276664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/873470471a482071b8e085095cf89221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"daggett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1276664/daggett"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569928549,"post_id":58183257,"comment_id":102746934,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183257/determing-twitter-api-rate-limit-for-statuses-filter-end-point#comment102746934_58183257"},{"owner":{"reputation":193,"user_id":6060088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97003fdba00a18b821cdb45c7dce003f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Manoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6060088/manoj"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12531,"user_id":1276664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/873470471a482071b8e085095cf89221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"daggett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1276664/daggett"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569930236,"post_id":58183257,"comment_id":102747747,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183257/determing-twitter-api-rate-limit-for-statuses-filter-end-point#comment102747747_58183257"},{"owner":{"reputation":12531,"user_id":1276664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/873470471a482071b8e085095cf89221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"daggett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1276664/daggett"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569930616,"post_id":58183257,"comment_id":102747957,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183257/determing-twitter-api-rate-limit-for-statuses-filter-end-point#comment102747957_58183257"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":193,"user_id":6060088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97003fdba00a18b821cdb45c7dce003f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Manoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6060088/manoj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570083725,"post_id":58186036,"comment_id":102803281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183257/determing-twitter-api-rate-limit-for-statuses-filter-end-point/58186036#comment102803281_58186036"},{"owner":{"reputation":2674,"user_id":886719,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f61f07eb4347b5dbbd090b8e4f4b1bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jonas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/886719/jonas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":193,"user_id":6060088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97003fdba00a18b821cdb45c7dce003f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Manoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6060088/manoj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570113139,"post_id":58186036,"comment_id":102818430,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183257/determing-twitter-api-rate-limit-for-statuses-filter-end-point/58186036#comment102818430_58186036"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2674,"user_id":886719,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f61f07eb4347b5dbbd090b8e4f4b1bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jonas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/886719/jonas"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569937094,"creation_date":1569937094,"answer_id":58186036,"question_id":58183257,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58186036","body_markdown":"You are limited to a single streaming connection connection.

What am I missing?\r\n\r\nYou may get some help from [this blog](https://kimsereyblog.blogspot.com/2018/08/sdk-style-project-and-projectassetsjson.html#targetText=Overview%20of%20project.assets.json&amp;targetText=Building%20requires%20the%20project.assets,when%20dotnet%20restore%20is%20executed.), ***project.assets.json** lists all the dependencies of the project*. \r\n\r\nWhen you create a new `.net core` project in VS, it will create this file for you. Open it with notepad and you can find it doesn&#39;t specify runtime by default:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nWhen you try to build it by msbuild command-line with `/p:Runtimeidentifier=win-x64`, then msbuild can&#39;t recognize that runtime since it&#39;s not defined in the `projects.assets.json` file.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to workaround this issue is to add `-restore` switch when you specify the command with a `Runtimeidentifier=xxx`.\r\n\r\nSo actually you need to pass the below parameters to msbuild, no need to manually edit the `xx.csproj` file:\r\n\r\n    /p:TargetFramework=xxx /p:Runtimeidentifier=xxx /restore\r\n\r\nMsbuild will execute the `restore` target before it run `build` target, and the `restore` target will regenerate a new `projects.assets.json` file for win-64, see:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**Solution**:\r\n\r\nSo the correct way is to add a `restore` switch to your build command, then the build will succeed no matter which `Runtimeidentifier` you want to target. Avoid manually editing the `Runtimeidentifier` in project file!\r\n\r\nAs for why it works in VS:VS will do the restore work automatically for us when we use the Publish function(right-click project=&gt;Publish). We can easily find a projects.assets.json for win-64 in path `ProjectFolder\\obj\\publish\\win-x64`, so it succeeds when you publish from VS.

You may also need to include &#39;win-x64&#39; in your project&#39;s RuntimeIdentifiers.\r\n\r\nI had thought that passing the below in the parameters to MSBuild should have resolved the issue.\r\n\r\n    /p:TargetFramework=netcoreapp2.2 /p:Runtimeidentifier=win-x64\r\n\r\nHowvever this was not the case. \r\n\r\nI could build/publish the project from within Visual Studio, but not via the Team City build agent.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the build agent to build/publish, I had to the project .csproj file and declare the runtime identifier:\r\n\r\n    &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n        &lt;TargetFramework&gt;netcoreapp2.2&lt;/TargetFramework&gt;\r\n        &lt;RuntimeIdentifier&gt;win-x64&lt;/RuntimeIdentifier&gt;\r\n    &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that either Team City is ignoring the MSBuild parameters, I have the parameters incorrect, or Visual Studio is carrying out an additional step I&#39;m not aware of to declare the runtime identifier on publish (via WebDeploy).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve obviously resolved the issue I was having, but this doesn&#39;t seem to be the &#39;correct&#39; way of doing it. What am I missing?\r\n\r\nThanks,","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183255/netcore-runtime-identifier-parameters-ignored-msbuild-team-city","title":".NetCore runtime identifier parameters ignored, MSBuild, Team City"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7926}
