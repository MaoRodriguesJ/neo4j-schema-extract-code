This means you\r\n&gt; can use Google’s Android emulator side-by-side with other Hyper-V\r\n&gt; based technologies, including Hyper-V VMs, Docker tooling, the\r\n&gt; HoloLens emulator, and more. This also means that any Android\r\n&gt; developer on Windows, who also uses Hyper-V, can use a fast Android\r\n&gt; emulator that will always support the latest Android APIs, works with\r\n&gt; Google Play Services out of the box, and works with all features in\r\n&gt; the Android emulator, including camera, geolocation, and Quick Boot.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; More information on configuration is available here:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/android/get-started/installation/android-emulator/hardware-acceleration?pivots=windows#accelerating-with-hyper-v\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/400998/visual-studio-emulator-for-vs-19.html\r\n  [2]:https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/comments/435068/view.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281676/why-doesnt-visual-studio-2019-show-the-emulator-once-it-is-started-in-visual-s/58282164#58282164","title":"Why doesn&#39;t Visual Studio 2019 show the emulator once it is started in &#39;Visual Studio Emulator for Android&#39;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6297,"user_id":937440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ba5f9ad02a9ab43d4664d17747a1230?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"w0051977","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/937440/w0051977"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1227,"user_id":4977870,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mqd5a.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anas Alweish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4977870/anas-alweish"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58282164,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570535072,"creation_date":1570518689,"last_edit_date":1570535072,"question_id":58281676,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281676","body_markdown":"I have recently uninstalled Visual Studio 2017 Community edition and installed Visual Studio 2019 Community edition on my PC at home.\r\n\r\nI have never managed to get hardware acceleration working because of the problems described here: https://superuser.com/questions/1482586/cannot-launch-an-x86-android-emulator-using-hyperv-but-can-with-haxm-why\r\n\r\nHowever, using Visual Studio 2017 I could use &#39;Visual Studio Emulator for Android&#39; in the Start menu as shown below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI would launch one of the emulators and it would appear in Visual Studio 2017 for debugging as shown below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/f2dxl.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GQPoL.png\r\n\r\nHowever, Visual Studio 2019 does not show the emulator in Visual Studio once it is started in &#39;Visual Studio Emulator for Android&#39;.

table column already has a sorter function for allowing the reordering so you don&#39;t need to store the sorted values in state.\r\n\r\nAlthough you have something called `dateSort: &quot;next_3_day&quot;` which ostensibly seems like you want to filter your data set (not just sort), which is a different question.\r\n\r\nIt looks like you want to do the following:\r\n\r\n`dataSource={this.state.dateSort === &#39;next_3_day&#39; ? events.filter(x=&gt;x.date &gt; new Date((new Date()).getTime() + (60*60*24*3))):this.events}`\r\n\r\n[and extend for the other 3 dateSorts` options]\r\n\r\nPersonally I wouldn&#39;t store the filtered value in state, I would just create a function that filters it.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re setting the state with `dateSort` so the component will re-render and it will allow for new data to be passed from the parent component.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d also suggest using `https://date-fns.org/` for simplified date arithmetic

I think I understand what you&#39;re trying to achieve, and you don&#39;t really need scipy to do it. \r\nFor starters, you&#39;re not really interested in what the values of P1 and P2 are, because you really want to optimize only their sum V3, so actually any 2 numbers whose sum is the optimal V3 will do the job.\r\nNow we&#39;re left to find V3. It&#39;s actually fairly easy to do, as the aforementioned optimal value will be one of the two numbers with only one significant decimal places closest to the mean.

When two entity classes in different packages share the same class name, explicit entity name setting is required to avoid collision.\r\n\r\nOr, if you have `Board` as table, not as entity name, and you query is native (Not JPQL), you can use `@Query(&quot;SELECT b FROM study.Board b WHERE b.title like %?1% ORDER BY b.seq DESC&quot;, nativeQuery = true)`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281613/spring-boot-postgresql-jpa-query-doesnt-seem-to-be-working/58283051#58283051","title":"Spring Boot PostgreSQL JPA @Query doesn&#39;t seem to be working"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11991845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0593161f94f8f3ad4441476296eb2e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"limsrs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11991845/limsrs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11991845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0593161f94f8f3ad4441476296eb2e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"limsrs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11991845/limsrs"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58283051,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570533765,"creation_date":1570518402,"last_edit_date":1570519354,"question_id":58281613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281613","body_markdown":"I am studying ```spring boot``` while referring to the book.\r\n\r\nI used DB for ```H2``` in the book, but I worked with ```PostgreSQL```.\r\n\r\nUsing the query method in the book DB work well.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I start using ```Annotation Query```, it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s look at the code.\r\n\r\napplication.properties\r\n\r\n```properties\r\nspring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver\r\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://Heroku Postgres URL\r\nspring.datasource.username=Heroku Postgres username\r\nspring.datasource.password=Heroku Postgres password\r\n\r\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update\r\nspring.jpa.generate-ddl=false\r\nspring.jpa.show-sql=true\r\nspring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true\r\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults = false\r\n```\r\n\r\njava code\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic interface BoardRepository extends CrudRepository&lt;Board, Long&gt; {\r\n\t@Query(&quot;SELECT b FROM study.Board b WHERE b.title like %?1% ORDER BY b.seq DESC&quot;)\r\n\tList&lt;Board&gt; queryAnnotationTest1(String searchKeyword);\r\n\r\n\t/*@Query(&quot;SELECT b FROM study.Board b &quot; \r\n\t+ &quot;WHERE b.title like %:searchKeyword% &quot; \r\n\t+ &quot;ORDER BY b.seq DESC&quot;)\r\n\tList&lt;Board&gt; queryAnnotationTest2(@Param(&quot;searchKeyword&quot;) String searchKeyword);*/\r\n}\r\n\r\n@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\r\n@SpringBootTest\r\npublic class QueryMethodTest {\r\n\t@Autowired\r\n\tprivate BoardRepository repository;\r\n\r\n\tpublic void testQueryAnnotationTest1() {\r\n\t\tList&lt;Board&gt; boardList = repository.queryAnnotationTest2(&quot;test title 10&quot;);\r\n\t\ttestPrintOutMethod(boardList);\r\n\t}\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\tprivate void testPrintOutMethod(List&lt;Board&gt; boardList) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;test result&quot;);\r\n\t\tfor (Board board : boardList) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;---&gt; &quot; + board.toString());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nError Message.\r\n```\r\n2019-10-08 16:21:53.038  WARN 10880 --- [           main] aWebConfiguration$JpaWebMvcConfiguration : spring.jpa.open-in-view is enabled by default.

Here just provide a simple example show how to use `StateT` with reading characters from standard input. \r\n\r\nFirstly, to define the `advanceState` function as:\r\n\r\n    advanceState::StateT [Char] IO [Char]\r\n    advanceState = StateT readInput where\r\n        readInput cs = do c &lt;- getChar\r\n                          let newState = (c:cs)\r\n                          return (newState, newState)\r\n\r\nThe function embedded in `StateT` is `readInput`, it has type: \r\n\r\n    [Char]-&gt;IO ([Char], [Char])\r\n\r\nThe first element of pair `([Char], [Char])` is input that what we want, and the second element of that is the &quot;state&quot; will pass to `readInput` whenever `advanceState` is called again.\r\n\r\nNow, below is an example show how to use `advanceState`:\r\n\r\n    getChar10::StateT [Char] IO [Char]\r\n    getChar10 = do s &lt;- advanceState\r\n                   if (length s) &lt;= 10\r\n                   then getChar10\r\n                   else do put []\r\n                           return (reverse s)\r\n\r\nThis example show how to get 10 character from standard input when the user press enter, note that `put []` reset the state so that next call of `advanceState` will not has the previous input.\r\n\r\nFinally, we can play around with them:\r\n\r\n    playState::IO ()\r\n    playState = print =&lt;&lt; evalStateT loop [] where\r\n        loop  = do s1 &lt;- getChar10\r\n                   s2 &lt;- getChar10\r\n                   return (s1 ++ &quot;::&quot; ++ s2)  \r\n\r\nThe `playState` function will print first 20 characters (included new line character \\n, \\r) whatever how many characters user has inputted before press enter. If input not enough 20 characters, `playState` will request user to input more characters.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281577/state-with-io-in-haskell-for-cli-application/58284053#58284053","title":"State with IO in Haskell for CLI application"}],"owner":{"reputation":433,"user_id":4330449,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100006825462602/picture?type=large","display_name":"Niklas Vest","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4330449/niklas-vest"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6181,"user_id":2900502,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1OjD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shersh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2900502/shersh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570528522,"creation_date":1570518260,"last_edit_date":1570521603,"question_id":58281577,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281577","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a simple implementation of the game Hangman in Haskell and one problem I have is keeping the state of the game.\r\n\r\nA simplified / abstract version of my problem looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nadvanceState :: Char -&gt;

are two problems in this task.\r\n\r\nHow to read user input until the &#39;#&#39; is pressed and how to reverse the char array (String).\r\n\r\nCheck this out\r\n\r\n     public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {\r\n            String chars = &quot;&quot;;\r\n            char inChar = 0;\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Enter Character and press Enter: &quot;);\r\n    \r\n            while (inChar!=&#39;#&#39;) {\r\n                inChar = (char)System.in.read();\r\n                if (inChar==&#39;\\n&#39;){\r\n                    continue;\r\n

Code updated with System.in.read() in place of Scanner.\r\n\r\nIn the while loop, the code reads user input until &#39;#&#39; key is pressed. Java cannot read keypresses unless you use GUI (swing, awt) or a JNI C++ library. So code reads user input when Enter is pressed.\r\n\r\nIf user enters # then the loop breaks. For all the other characters the character is added to the final String. As System.in.read() reads also new lines (\\n) the code does not add them to the final string.\r\n\r\nFor the second problem, the code iterates so many times as the length of the final String and prints the characters starting from the last one.  \r\nNote that the iteration starts with character at position length-2, this is because the last character of the String is &#39;#&#39;, therefore this should not be printed at the output.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281526/how-to-read-and-output-characters-without-using-array-or-string-in-java/58282194#58282194","title":"How to read and output characters without using Array or String in Java?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11115633,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fecaabe69494482643598eaba06ef257?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxir200","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11115633/maxir200"},"last_editor":{"reputation":126223,"user_id":2319407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/98O16.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitry Bychenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2319407/dmitry-bychenko"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570522355,"creation_date":1570518018,"last_edit_date":1570518268,"question_id":58281526,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281526","body_markdown":"I should read an user input using `System.in.read()`, save this into a `char` or `int` variable and output the user input in *reversed order*.

immediate problem is that a single-character C-style string occupies **two** bytes: the character and the NUL terminator. So your arrays are too short and you&#39;re writing outside their bounds.\r\n\r\nHowever, you don&#39;t need arrays at all. You can just store the appropriate character:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid readData()\r\n{\r\n    ifstream myfile;\r\n    myfile.open(&quot;input.txt&quot;);\r\n    while (myfile.good())\r\n    {\r\n        string line;\r\n        getline(myfile, line, &#39; &#39;);\r\n        char v = line[0];\r\n        getline(myfile, line);\r\n        char w = line[0];\r\n        graph-&gt;addEdge(v, w);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that there&#39;s no need to explicitly `close` the file. Its destructor will do it for you just fine.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote that the code above does not do any error checking. In production code, you should always test the result of input operations (such as the `getline` call) for success. The simplest solution could look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid readData()\r\n{\r\n    ifstream myfile;\r\n    myfile.open(&quot;input.txt&quot;);\r\n    while (myfile.good())\r\n    {\r\n        string line;\r\n        if (!getline(myfile, line, &#39; &#39;) || line.empty())\r\n            break;\r\n        char v = line[0];\r\n        if (!getline(myfile, line) || line.empty())\r\n            break;\r\n        char w = line[0];\r\n        graph-&gt;addEdge(v, w);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281509/stack-smashing-detected-while-reading-file/58281615#58281615","title":"stack smashing detected while reading file"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10600372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-hMqzepu4qsk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbC3A6VFeUKHwcX_1T98G0-Nl3wZtQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abhishek Patil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10600372/abhishek-patil"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58281615,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570519295,"creation_date":1570517961,"question_id":58281509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281509","body_markdown":"I have made a method to read data from a `input.txt` file\r\nhere is the code\r\n```\r\nvoid readData()\r\n{\r\n    ifstream myfile;\r\n    myfile.open(&quot;input.txt&quot;);\r\n    char v[1], w[1];\r\n    while (myfile.good())\r\n    {\r\n        string line;\r\n        getline(myfile, line, &#39; &#39;);\r\n        strcpy(v, line.c_str());\r\n        getline(myfile, line);\r\n        strcpy(w, line.c_str());\r\n        //graph-&gt;addEdge(v[0], w[0]);\r\n    }\r\n    myfile.close();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI am trying to get two vertices from input file whose one line contains two character. and I have made a `addEdge` method in my `Graph` class which takes two char as input to add it into graph.\r\n\r\nhere is my input.txt file\r\n```\r\nA B\r\nA C\r\nF D\r\nD C\r\nU I\r\nU D\r\nB I\r\nF B\r\n```\r\nbut when I run the programme it is giving error \r\n```\r\n*** stack smashing detected ***: &lt;unknown&gt; terminated\r\nAborted (core dumped)\r\n```\r\nI do not understand why this error is comming.

I have put my #include of the cpp file for the LinkedList on the header and included the header on the cpp like normal and included in both and none of them have worked. i have triple read all the words to make sure all the spelling and everything matches.\r\n\r\nLinkedList.h\r\n\r\n    #ifndef LINKEDLIST_H\r\n    #define LINKEDLIST_H\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;SLNode.h&quot;\r\n    #include &quot;ListInterface.h&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n    template &lt;typename ItemType&gt;\r\n    class LinkedList: public ListInterface&lt;ItemType&gt;\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        LinkedList();\r\n        void addFront(SLNode&lt;ItemType&gt;* entry);\r\n\r\n        bool isEmpty();\r\n        int getLength () const;\r\n        void insert(int newPosition, const ItemType &amp;newEntry);\r\n        void remove (int position);\r\n        void clear();\r\n        ItemType getEntry(int position) const;\r\n        void setEntry (int position, const ItemType&amp;

Though the actual process may be defined by run-time&#39;s implementation but few things could be understood in common. [This paper][1] could shed some more light. Please see section 3.3.\r\n\r\nIn the process of servicing a `throw`, a search for appropriate `catch` is initiated. This in itself may cause unwinding of the current stack frame. The side effect of unwinding a stack frame is that corresponding destructors for objects in current frame  be called. This action of calling a destructor again lands run-time in user&#39;s code area(unsafe). After this is done, we again enter in the run-time&#39;s territory(safer).\r\n\r\nFinally when a suitable `catch` is entered, the active exception is destroyed and it starts executing handler&#39;s code. For this reason the `throw` as shown in question, would not experience any active exception.\r\n\r\nThis also explains why we should not `throw` an exception from a destructor which goes out of scope. It would actually be a good practice to have a `try{....}catch(...)` block in destructor to safeguard from any untoward `terminate`() incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.usenix.org/conference/wiess-2000/c-exception-handling-ia64","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281478/how-gcc-libstdc-runtime-decides-to-terminate-while-an-exception-is-active/58283171#58283171","title":"How GCC (libstdc++) runtime decides to terminate() while an exception is active"}],"owner":{"reputation":1239,"user_id":457621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f259961b81ba0fe0f33e247faed1fcb3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ultimate cause","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/457621/ultimate-cause"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1239,"user_id":457621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f259961b81ba0fe0f33e247faed1fcb3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ultimate cause","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/457621/ultimate-cause"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58283171,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570525616,"creation_date":1570517822,"last_edit_date":1570521514,"question_id":58281478,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281478","body_markdown":"We know that `terminate`()  is called if an exception is currently active and there is another call to `throw`.\r\n\r\nWant to understand what causes this to be differentiated from a situation when a `catch` block does a `throw` from with-in? I am assuming that a if a `catch` block is executing, it signifies of an active exception.\r\n\r\n    class exception_type{}\r\n    \r\n    try{ ... throw obj; ... \r\n    }catch(exception_type&amp; obj){\r\n     ...\r\n     ... \r\n     throw x;\r\n     ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFrom this code sample, since we have another `throw` here in `catch` block, which should get caught by another handler in the dynamically enclosing `try` block.\r\nSo this seems to be a valid use of a `throw` inside `catch`. But at this moment we already have a an exception active. Why should not it cause `terminate`() to be called? Or in other words, how exactly the gcc&#39;s  c++ runtime would recognize that there is already an exception active and a `terminate`() needs to be called.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281478/how-gcc-libstdc-runtime-decides-to-terminate-while-an-exception-is-active","title":"How GCC (libstdc++) runtime decides to terminate()

In `scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;marks[i]);` when `i == 4` you are assigning a value to `marks[4]`. The standard says it&#39;s undefined behavior access `marks[4]` in any way, so from a standard point of view the program has undefined behavior and anything can happen.\r\n\r\nI guess most probably your compiler has placed the local variables such that `&amp;marks[4] == &amp;name[0]` - the address of element one past the end of `marks` array is the same address of the `name` array. \r\n\r\nMost probably on your system `sizeof(int) &gt;= 2`. When `scanf` reads `90` from the input, it stores `sizeof(int)` bytes into the pointer you have given it. Assuming `&amp;marks[4] == &amp;name[0]`, `scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;marks[4])` on execution becomes `scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, name);`.\r\n\r\nAssuming your environment is sane `CHAR_BIT = 8` and your environment is little endian, `scanf` really stores one byte `90` into the first byte of the pointer and clears the other bytes. So `sscanf(&quot;90&quot;, &quot;%d&quot;, &amp;name[0])` would be &quot;semi&quot;-equal to writing `sizeof(int)` bytes into `name` - one with value 90 and `sizeof(int) - 1` bytes with zeros, much like `memcpy(&amp;name[0], (char[sizeof(int)]){90,0}, sizeof(int))`.\r\n\r\nStrings in C are zero terminated and because the integer 90 is the letter `Z` in ascii and zero is the string termination character, when you later do:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;%s&quot;, name);\r\n\r\nThe `name` actually points to a null terminated string with the first byte `&#39;Z&#39;` and the second byte being the zero terminating character, so it prints just `Z`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281477/its-an-average-calculator-upto-5-values-using-array-in-c/58282639#58282639","title":"It&#39;s an average calculator upto 5 values, using array in c"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12180605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB0XPSsd8bUXcTZFoY8SZ2REFeg-uzWVkqLofmL=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"TheHeart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12180605/theheart"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22657,"user_id":1025391,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76a088ae59745a0c4a377f362fec0fc4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"moooeeeep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1025391/moooeeeep"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":82,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58282639,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570523524,"creation_date":1570517812,"last_edit_date":1570518468,"question_id":58281477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281477","body_markdown":"```\r\n#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n\r\n    char name[20];\r\n    int total = 0, i, marks[4];\r\n    float avr;\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;Enter name of the student: &quot;);\r\n    scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;name);\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;Enter marks of 5 subjects: &quot;);\r\n    for(i=0;

What would be the best approach to tackle this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281476/avoid-ngrx-store-dispatcher-to-endless-loops-sequence","title":"Avoid NgRx/Store dispatcher to endless loops sequence"},{"tags":["java","android","android-fragments"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":12163469,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB3EYgSN1etZFpYPINuPZ9-TJz37BWsJ9YYFeN7=k-s128","display_name":"DinhNguyen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12163469/dinhnguyen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570520464,"creation_date":1570520464,"answer_id":58282042,"question_id":58281474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58282042","body_markdown":"You have to override [onBackPressed().][1]\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onBackPressed() {\r\n        if (this.drawerLayout.isDrawerOpen(GravityCompat.START)) {\r\n            this.drawerLayout.closeDrawer(GravityCompat.START);\r\n        } else {\r\n            super.onBackPressed();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onBackPressed()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281474/android-studio-open-navigation-drawer-using-fragment-and-handle-back-button-pres/58282042#58282042","title":"Android Studio open navigation Drawer using fragment and handle back button press"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":11880263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bcWgF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CodeInsideCofee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11880263/codeinsidecofee"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570527342,"creation_date":1570527342,"answer_id":58283759,"question_id":58281474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58283759","body_markdown":"Visit below Stackoverflow link where i put solution stepwise to handle multiple fragment on backpress.\r\n[StackOverFlow Answer][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58278288/how-to-go-back-to-first-android-fragment-after-replace/58281063#58281063","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58281474/android-studio-open-navigation-drawer-using-fragment-and-handle-back-button-pres/58283759#58283759","title":"Android Studio open navigation Drawer using fragment and handle back button press"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11378560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1656251857809964/picture?type=large","display_name":"S&#225;j&#224;d W&#224;&#241;i","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11378560/s%c3%a1j%c3%a0d-w%c3%a0%c3%b1i"},"last_editor":{"reputation":367,"user_id":9882579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81d0e80b0a0ec7f63ba5aafe6ffa8808?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MohanKumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9882579/mohankumar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570527342,"creation_date":1570517799,"last_edit_date":1570522135,"question_id":58281474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58281474","body_markdown":"i have create a navigation drawer using fragments which is working fine.
