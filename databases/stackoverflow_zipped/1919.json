Nothing seems to work. The best I&#39;ve gotten was [Object HtmlDivElement] when using innerHTML on a div instead of a ng-template. As said before the only way for this to work properly is to include hardcoded html within an ng-template then reference that ng-template in the &#39;ngbPopover&#39; property. What is wrong with this is I don&#39;t have hardcoded HTML, but only a passed-in string (with HTML tags).\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;ng-template #popContent style=&quot;white-space:

recently found that depending on the database driver being used, jOOQ can exhibit some strange behavior in DateTime parsing.

driver resulted in DefaultBinding.java receiving a calendar object that has a timestamp, but calling toString on it in order to parse.   Turns out, toString does not print the timezone, then jOOQ inferred that it was in local time.  \r\n\r\nFor me, the offending lines in DefaultBinding.java (I was using a timestamp with timezone) were:\r\n\r\n    else if (type == OffsetDateTime.class) {\r\n        result = (T) offsetDateTime(ctx.resultSet().getString(ctx.index()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou may be on a different line in that series of else ifs based on not having a time zone.\r\n\r\nIn my testing, I also found that changing the system time changed the result, but changing the session time did nothing.  \r\n\r\nFortunately for me, a switch to the standard Postgres driver resolved the problem.  If it didn&#39;t, I was going to look in to overloading the binding for OffsetDateTime to fix the use of toString and it&#39;s associated stripping of the relevant time zone.  You may need to pursue that path, unfortunately, unless you too are using a SQL driver than could be upgraded or replaced.  Or, you could store it with a timezone and then convert to the desired timezone when you load from the database.

However when I run queries on a machine in a different timezone (in my case EST) the dates are all in my local machine timezone **even though the session timezone is UTC**. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve confirmed that the session timezone is UTC\r\n```java\r\ndslContext.fetch(&quot;SELECT @@system_time_zone,  @@global.time_zone, @@session.time_zone;&quot;)\r\n```\r\nreturns \r\n```\r\n|@@system_time_zone|@@global.time_zone|@@session.time_zone|\r\n+------------------+------------------+-------------------+\r\n|UTC               |SYSTEM            |SYSTEM             |\r\n+------------------+------------------+-------------------+\r\n```\r\nExample of timezone conversion:\r\n```\r\ndslContext.select(MY_TABLE.EPOCH_DT_TM, MY_TABLE.CREATION_TIMESTAMP).from(MY_TABLE).limit(1).fetch()\r\n\r\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n|epoch_dt_tm            |creation_timestamp     |\r\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n|2019-04-18T13:57:39.163|2019-09-24T16:06:47.754|\r\n+-----------------------+-----------------------+\r\n// CAST to STRING PROPERLY USES SESSION TIMEZONE \r\ndslContext.select(MY_TABLE.EPOCH_DT_TM.cast(org.jooq.impl.SQLDataType.VARCHAR(100)), MY_TABLE.CREATION_TIMESTAMP.cast(org.jooq.impl.SQLDataType.VARCHAR(100))).from(MY_TABLE).limit(1).fetch()\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|cast                      |cast                      |\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n|2019-04-18 17:57:39.163000|2019-09-24 20:06:47.754000|\r\n+--------------------------+--------------------------+\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fields in my generated entities:\r\n```java\r\n    public final TableField&lt;MyTableRecord, LocalDateTime&gt; EPOCH_DT_TM = createField(&quot;epoch_dt_tm&quot;, org.jooq.impl.SQLDataType.LOCALDATETIME, this, &quot;&quot;);\r\n    public final TableField&lt;MyTableRecord, LocalDateTime&gt; CREATION_TIMESTAMP = createField(&quot;creation_timestamp&quot;, org.jooq.impl.SQLDataType.LOCALDATETIME.nullable(false).defaultValue(org.jooq.impl.DSL.field(&quot;CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(6)&quot;, org.jooq.impl.SQLDataType.LOCALDATETIME)), this, &quot;&quot;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my questions are:\r\n\r\n 1. Is this expected behavior? Shouldn&#39;t the record get populated with the raw (non timezoned) date in the table. Are the dates still getting converted to java.sql.Timestamp under the hood for some reason?\r\n \r\n 2. If this is expected behavior is there any way to ensure that you get dates in the session timezone **regardless of the local timezone on the client machine**? It is very hard to test locally if the behavior of the code is dependent on the machine timezone.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085244/jooq-localdatetime-fields-use-system-timezone-instead-of-session-timezone","title":"Jooq LocalDateTime fields use system timezone instead of session timezone"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1089,"user_id":10447055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5dfbfdf71f7ae13144abe41f3e3f59c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10447055/gainz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569345908,"post_id":58085240,"comment_id":102564636,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085240/i-am-receiving-the-error-could-not-find-function-stripattributes-why-is-this#comment102564636_58085240"},{"owner":{"reputation":48768,"user_id":1003565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd05397868614fcd87d9243c8025a725?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1003565/dason"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569346071,"post_id":58085240,"comment_id":102564705,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085240/i-am-receiving-the-error-could-not-find-function-stripattributes-why-is-this#comment102564705_58085240"},{"owner":{"reputation":1089,"user_id":10447055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5dfbfdf71f7ae13144abe41f3e3f59c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gainz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10447055/gainz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569346073,"post_id":58085240,"comment_id":102564706,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085240/i-am-receiving-the-error-could-not-find-function-stripattributes-why-is-this#comment102564706_58085240"},{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569346384,"post_id":58085240,"comment_id":102564831,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085240/i-am-receiving-the-error-could-not-find-function-stripattributes-why-is-this#comment102564831_58085240"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":12042976,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Z7QSFKSL9gU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdOvda7GI2u9KuIoCLSTvzp_DXnyw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"blaze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12042976/blaze"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569345212,"creation_date":1569345212,"question_id":58085240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085240","body_markdown":" After installing merTools and using its library, Rstudio tells me it could not find the function.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(merTools)\r\n\r\nmysurvey &lt;- stripAttributes(mysurvey)\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085240/i-am-receiving-the-error-could-not-find-function-stripattributes-why-is-this","title":"I am receiving the error: &#39;could not find function &quot;stripAttributes&quot; Why is this?"},{"tags":["elasticsearch","nosql","kibana","elastic-stack","outer-join"],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6765460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c887b2c2e247611ee805a1ddf0b95b59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Forece85","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6765460/forece85"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6765460,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c887b2c2e247611ee805a1ddf0b95b59?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Forece85","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6765460/forece85"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569384511,"creation_date":1569345206,"last_edit_date":1569384511,"question_id":58085239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085239","body_markdown":"I have 2 Indices in Elasticsearch with below data.

These classes supplant the troublesome old [legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) date-time classes such as [`java.util.Date`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Date.html), [`Calendar`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Calendar.html), &amp; [`SimpleDateFormat`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html).\r\n\r\nTo learn more, see the [*Oracle Tutorial*](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/datetime/TOC.html). And search Stack Overflow for many examples and explanations.

Shared Application Models\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Occasionally, you may encounter applications where it is not possible\r\n&gt; to Attach to the target application, making the recommended\r\n&gt; multi-object design problematic. Fortunately, v5 of Blue Prism\r\n&gt; introduced the concept of a shared application model to enable a\r\n&gt; multi-object design approach in such scenarios. When using a shared\r\n&gt; application model, all the elements are managed within a single object\r\n&gt; (typically the object that launches the application) and accessed by\r\n&gt; the other objects.

Now the user clicks somewhere and the `Selection` changes. Lots of low-level boilerplate non-VBA code needs to run for this to happen, but at one point or another, this happens (pseudo-code) somewhere in the `Worksheet` object&#39;s guts:\r\n\r\n    RaiseEvent SelectionChange(ActiveCell)\r\n\r\nThis raises the `Worksheet.SelectionChange` event:\r\n\r\n![Members of &#39;Worksheet&#39;, with &#39;SelectionChange&#39; event selected (as seen in the Object Browser)][1]\r\n\r\nWhen this event is raised, if there&#39;s a *handler* for this event, that&#39;s when it will be invoked. This handler needs to be wired up - you can do that yourself using a `WithEvents` object variable, but Excel&#39;s *document modules* make it very easy to wire up a handler - simply go to the `Worksheet` module you want to handle worksheet events for, select `Worksheet` from the code pane&#39;s left-side dropdown...\r\n\r\n![code pane dropdowns, left one is dropped, &#39;Worksheet&#39; is selected][2]\r\n\r\n...and the VBE creates the handler procedure for you - note the contents of the two dropdowns:\r\n\r\n![Worksheet::SelectionChange handler signature was added automatically by the editor][3]\r\n\r\nThe handler procedure is named in a very specific way: \r\n\r\n    LeftSideDropdownValue_RightSideDropdownValue\r\n\r\nThe &quot;left-side dropdown value&quot; is the *interface* you want to implement a member for; the &quot;right-side dropdown value&quot; is the specific member you&#39;re implementing.\r\n\r\nIf you placed the caret inside your procedure, the left-side dropdown would say `(General)` - that means it&#39;s just another procedure, and if nothing is invoking it then it&#39;s just another *unused* procedure that might as well not exist.\r\n\r\nSo, you&#39;re the Excel application, and you&#39;re opening a workbook. The exact same thing happens: lots of low-level boilerplate non-VBA code needs to run as a bunch of objects are being deserialized from the .xlsm macro-enabled workbook file loaded from disk, and when everything is good to go this happens (pseudo-code) somewhere in the opened `Workbook` object&#39;s guts:\r\n\r\n    RaiseEvent Open\r\n\r\nThis raises the `Workbook.Open` event:\r\n\r\n![Members of &#39;Workbook&#39;, with &#39;Open&#39; event selected (as seen in the Object Browser)][4]\r\n\r\nOnce again, we could declare a `WithEvents` object variable and wire-up a handler ourselves, but a VBA project hosted in Excel will always have a `Workbook` document module that already does this for us - so in order to handle the `Workbook.Open` event, we can go to the `ThisWorkbook` module, select `Workbook` from the left-side dropdown, and have the VBE automatically generate a well-formed handler for us:\r\n\r\n    Private Sub Workbook_Open()\r\n\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAgain, the reason VBA knows this procedure is handling the `Workbook.Open` event, is because the name says so:\r\n\r\n    [Interface]_[Member]\r\n\r\nIf we go and change the name to anything else, we break that link, and we know the link is broken because the left-side code pane dropdown will be saying `(General)` and not `Workbook`.\r\n\r\nThis special naming scheme is also the reason why you should avoid using underscores in your own procedure names: they make procedures *look* like event handlers, but they&#39;re not. In certain specific advanced scenarios, using underscores in member names can even cause compile errors. Best take the good habit early on, of sticking to simple `PascalCase` for procedure names.\r\n\r\nIf we go and change the list of parameters in any way that makes it incompatible with the event&#39;s declaration, we get a compile error:\r\n\r\n![Procedure declaration does not match description of event or procedure having the same name][5]\r\n\r\nYou can safely tweak the parameter names (although, I can&#39;t think of any good reason to do this), but the parameter data types and their ordering cannot be modified.\r\n\r\nSee [everything you ever wanted to know about events](https://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/2019/03/27/everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-events/) for more info (I wrote that article).\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pfqjs.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/aDWwS.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/kMzuj.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Iy3sy.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DkhZZ.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085232/how-come-excel-vba-code-not-working-on-open/58086375#58086375","title":"How come excel vba code not working on open?"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":10054520,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d2b27bbbd317802385e3dcd6f22a6a6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MyNameHere","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10054520/mynamehere"},"last_editor":{"reputation":709,"user_id":11766312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fc60fb0c356f40c1b09794cccd8ee65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Miles Fett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11766312/miles-fett"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569350352,"creation_date":1569345196,"last_edit_date":1569346890,"question_id":58085232,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085232","body_markdown":"I have code that is supposed to run on open, but I don&#39;t understand why it&#39;s not working.

We also have a Data virtualization server (based on Tomcat) which is also kerberos enabled (Denodo server). We would like to have Denodo connect to Phoenix so Denodo users can get data from Phoenix. We are confused as far as the syntax we need to use. From JDBC personal clients (DBeaver and Squirrel) we can use this syntax and it connects correctly:\r\n\r\njdbc:phoenix:myserver.mycompany.com:2181:/hbase-secure:user.name@MYCOMPANY.COM:/Users/user.name/krb5cc_user.name\r\n\r\nNow, when we try to connect from the Denodo server we cannot use a personal keytab. So we are trying with this format:\r\n\r\njdbc:phoenix:myserver.mycompany.com:2181:/hbase-secure:HTTP/myserver.mycompany.com@MYCOMPANY.COM:/etc/security/keytabs/myservice.keytab\r\n\r\nThat did not work and we get this error:\r\n\r\nERROR 103 (08004): Unable to establish connection.\r\n  Login failure for HTTP/myserver.mycompany.com@MYCOMPANY.COM from keytab /etc/security/keytabs/myservice.keytab: javax.security.auth.login.LoginException: Unable to obtain password from user\r\n\r\nAfter doing a lot of googling, we have tried different iterations of that principal to \r\n\r\nhbase/hdpopst@MYCOMPANY.COM\r\n\r\nand always end up with the same error. So, I have two questions: is there an official documentation from Phoenix on this subject? we have not found it. Is that the correct syntax to connect these two services via

I&#39;m currently trying to code a simple 2D platformer game called &quot;Ninjumper&quot;. I have the actual platformer game set up in my GameScene, and I am currently working on creating a main menu with a &quot;Play&quot; button that takes you to the GameScene. All I have on my MenuScene is a color sprite (with texture &quot;playbutton&quot;), that I have programmatically made into a button. When this button is clicked, however, my program crashes with the error shown in the title.\r\n\r\nHere is the code inside of my MenuScene:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n//\r\n//  MenuScene.swift\r\n//  Ninjumper\r\n\r\nimport SpriteKit\r\n\r\nclass MenuScene: SKScene {\r\n    \r\n    var playButton = SKSpriteNode(texture: SKTexture(imageNamed: &quot;playbutton&quot;))\r\n    \r\n    override func didMove(to view: SKView) {\r\n        addPlayButton()\r\n}\r\n\r\n    override func touchesBegan(_ touches: Set&lt;UITouch&gt;, with event: UIEvent?) {\r\n        for touch in touches {\r\n            let location = touch.location(in: self)\r\n            let touchedNode = atPoint(location)\r\n            if touchedNode.name == &quot;playButton&quot; {\r\n                // Call the function here.\r\n            let scene = GameScene(fileNamed: &quot;GameScene&quot;)!\r\n            let transition = SKTransition.moveIn(with: .right, duration: 1)\r\n            self.view?.presentScene(scene, transition: transition)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    func addPlayButton() {\r\n        playButton.position = CGPoint(x: 0, y: -156)\r\n        playButton.name = &quot;playButton&quot;\r\n        playButton.size = CGSize(width: 280.0, height: 100.0)\r\n        playButton.isHidden = false\r\n        addChild(playButton)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to make it so that when you tap on the button, the scene switches from the MenuScene to the GameScene. However, the code that I currently have results in the error: Could not cast value of type &#39;Ninjumper.GameScene&#39; to &#39;SKSpriteNode&#39;. How should I fix this? (Or if you have other ways to make the button switch scenes, let me know)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085205/error-could-not-cast-value-of-type-ninjumper-gamescene-to-skspritenode-when","title":"Error: Could not cast value of type

I have two mains questions:\r\n\r\n1. **Is there an explanation of why and/or how these files were generated with such errors?** I&#39;d expect these files to have been generated by dumping a triple store or an engine such as Apache Jena, and as such to be well formed. Instead, it seems more likely that they were put together using some kind of custom script (or a pipeline of Unix tools, maybe?), hence the errors...\r\n1. **Is there a way to fix these files?** (or, worst case scenario, to ignore the malformed lines, other than `serdi -l`. Extra points for a solution which also doesn&#39;t require me to implement a cleaning script from scratch).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/freebase-public/rdf/freebase-rdf-2012-08-17-21-54.gz\r\n  [2]: https://archive.org/download/wikidata-json-20150420/wikidata-20150420-all-BETA.ttl.gz\r\n  [3]: http://www.linkedbrainz.org/LinkedBrainz201712.tgz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085152/invalid-characters-and-other-problems-in-rdf-knowledge-graphs","title":"Invalid characters and other problems in RDF knowledge graphs"},{"tags":["javascript","php","ajax","email","dropdown"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36861,"user_id":1011527,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/950d56c466691980bba71859798bfe65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jay Blanchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011527/jay-blanchard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569344987,"post_id":58085151,"comment_id":102564226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085151/issues-with-php-post-via-ajax-within-bootstrap-4-form#comment102564226_58085151"},{"owner":{"reputation":15353,"user_id":1172798,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z0c7b.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"devpro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1172798/devpro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569345004,"post_id":58085151,"comment_id":102564233,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085151/issues-with-php-post-via-ajax-within-bootstrap-4-form#comment102564233_58085151"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9150181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5faf4d19fb501907ed1a6c4af4a051d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.

They also provide a simple contact form using a standard Bootstrap Form, which sends the data to a .js File for preprocessing and afterwards the Message gets POSTed (with an AJAX call) to a Server PHP script which actually sends the mail.\r\n\r\n**My Problem is: All the Form data is send, except the entries within a Dropdown element.**\r\n\r\nOne Dropdown example:\r\n```\r\n &lt;label for=&quot;adults&quot;&gt;Erwachsene&lt;/label&gt;\r\n &lt;select name=&quot;adults&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;adults&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;keine&quot;&gt;0&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/option&gt;\r\n    &lt;option value=&quot;5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/option&gt;\r\n &lt;/select&gt;\r\n```\r\n1. the Form has no action - as the js. script is invoked as I press submit (default behaviour is prevented)\r\n2. The values of the form are NOT SERIALIZED, they are all collected one-by-one with ```$(select#inputID).val()```\r\n3. It does not matter if one uses ```document.getElementById(#inputID).value``` or any other call\r\n4.

So error messages cannot be seen in this case.\r\n\r\nThe `for` command line can be modified easily here to get also error messages written into the `C:\\Apps\\Debug.log`.\r\n\r\n    FOR /F &quot;tokens=* USEBACKQ&quot; %%F IN (`sqlcmd -j -S DOMAIN\\SQLSERVER -U username -P password -d DBNAME -Q &quot;UPDATE [DBNAME].[dbo].[table1] SET ColOne=&#39;V1_OFF&#39; WHERE ColOne=&#39;V1&#39; 2^&gt;^&amp;1&quot;`) DO (\r\n\r\nThe Microsoft article [Using command redirection operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-xp/bb490982(v=technet.10)) explains `2&gt;&amp;1`. The two operators `&gt;` and `&amp;` must be escaped with `^` to be interpreted as literal characters on Windows command processor parsing the `for` command line before executing finally `for` which executes next `%ComSpec% /c` with the specified command line on which `2^&gt;^&amp;1` is changed already to `2&gt;&amp;1`.\r\n\r\nDoes the log file `C:\\App\\Debug.log` contain with this modification following two lines?\r\n\r\n&gt; &#39;sqlcmd&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command,  \r\n&gt; operable program or batch file.\r\n\r\nYes, then no executable with file name `sqlcmd` is found by started `cmd.exe`. The best solution is referencing this executable with full qualified file name. See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41454769/\r\n\r\nOtherwise `sqlcmd` outputs perhaps an error message which should be now also in the log file `C:\\App\\Debug.log`.\r\n\r\nIt would be also possible to use following command line to let background `cmd.exe` write the error messages into a separate error log file `C:\\App\\Error.log`:\r\n\r\n    FOR /F &quot;tokens=* USEBACKQ&quot; %%F IN (`sqlcmd -j -S DOMAIN\\SQLSERVER -U username -P password -d DBNAME -Q &quot;UPDATE [DBNAME].[dbo].[table1] SET ColOne=&#39;V1_OFF&#39; WHERE ColOne=&#39;V1&#39;&quot; 2^&gt;C:\\App\\Error.log`) DO (\r\n\r\n`&quot;tokens=* usebackq&quot;` results in first deleting all leading horizontal tabs and normal spaces on non-empty lines by `for`, then checking if the remaining line starts with `;` in which case the line is&#160;also ignored and finally assigning the captured line not starting with `;` and with leading tabs/spaces removed to loop variable `F` for further processing.\r\n\r\nBetter would be using the options `usebackq^ delims^=^ eol^=` not enclosed in double quotes which requires escaping the two spaces and the two equal signs with caret character `^` to be interpreted as literal characters by `cmd.exe` on parsing the command line before executing `for`. The line splitting behavior is disabled completed with `delims=` because of the definition of an empty list of delimiters. And no line except an empty line is ignored anymore because of end of line character modified from default `;` to no character.\r\n\r\nFinally a space on an `echo` line left to redirection operator `&gt;&gt;` is also output by `echo` and for that reason written as trailing space into the log file. Therefore no space should be used left to `&gt;` or `&gt;&gt;` on printing a line with `echo` redirected into a file. But care must be taken on omitting the space character left to the redirection operator. The __word__ left to redirection operator should not be `1`, `2`, ..., `9` as this would result in redirecting the output to these numbered handles into the specified file instead of the character `1`, `2`, etc. So if unknown text should be written into a file, it is better to specify first the redirection operator `&gt;` or `&gt;&gt;` and the full qualified file name and next the `echo` command with the text to output. See also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46968425/\r\n\r\nThe three command lines with `echo` would be for this batch file:\r\n\r\n    ECHO Disabling the following...&gt;&gt; C:\\App\\Debug.log\r\n    ECHO - V1&gt;&gt; C:\\Apps\\Debug.log\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;C:\\Apps\\Debug.log ECHO %%F\r\n\r\n`following...` is safe for being correct written into the file as also `V1`. `%%F` could be just `1` or a string ending with a space and a single digit and so it is better to specify the redirection first on the last `echo` command line to get finally executed by `cmd.exe` the command line `ECHO %%F 1&gt;&gt;C:\\Apps\\Debug.log`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085121/running-sqlcmd-in-batch-file-works-but-running-the-same-batch-file-as-a-schedule/58087730#58087730","title":"Running sqlcmd in batch file works but running the same batch file as a scheduled task works and does nothing"}],"owner":{"reputation":2238,"user_id":1039753,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b31d2582e730251114a5374a29a64dc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Arvo Bowen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1039753/arvo-bowen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58087730,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569357131,"creation_date":1569344696,"question_id":58085121,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085121","body_markdown":"I have looked at many SO questions/answers and though some seem similar to my issue they do not seem to be.

lead dev for a project at work thinks that using a &quot;known-bad&quot; system is fine for preventing SQL injection attacks.  I have mentioned that we should be using parameterized queries, but he won&#39;t budge unless I can demonstrate an attack that works.  I have so far been unable to successfully inject SQL, but I know it is vulnerable.  The database is MS SQL server.  Web server is using VB.NET.\r\n\r\nstring cleaning function:\r\n```vb.net\r\nsOut = Replace(sIn, &quot;&#39;&quot;, Chr(180))\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;select&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;drop table&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;;&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;--&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;insert&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;delete&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;xp_&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;sp_&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;www&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;http://&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;&lt;script&gt;&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;declare&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;update&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;@@&quot;)\r\nbadChars.Add(&quot;.js &quot;)\r\n\r\nFor i = 0 To badChars.Count - 1\r\n    sOut = Replace(sOut, badChars(i), &quot;&quot;)\r\n    sOut = Replace(sOut, UCase(badChars(i)), &quot;&quot;)\r\nNext\r\nReturn sOut\r\n```\r\n\r\nQuery creation:\r\n```VB.NET\r\nstrSQL = &quot;SELECT employeeID FROM Employees WHERE Email = &#39;&quot; &amp; strUserName &amp; &quot;&#39; AND Password = &#39;&quot; &amp; strPassword &amp; &quot;&#39; AND Status = &#39;Active&#39;&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nstrUserName and strPassword are both passed through the string cleaning function.\r\n\r\nI need an EXACT attack that will break this.  If I cannot successfully login to our system with injection the boss won&#39;t spend the time/money on changing the code.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nComments requested that I mention what I have tried so far.  Basic injections don&#39;t work since single quotes are filtered out.  I attempted to smuggle a single quote in using unicode, but that also did not work.  The unicode character was read as unicode by both the VB.NET and SQL server.  I know that the special words filters can be bypassed by doing things like &quot;SELSELECTECT&quot; to get the word select past the filter, but that doesn&#39;t work unless I can get a single quote in to get out of the string.\r\n\r\nOK so this question was flagged for being too broad.  I am asking for a SQL injection that works against this sanitation.  That is a very specific request.

Hence, you can only change this property on a window object and the sheet affected will be the one active.\r\n\r\nAlternative properties inside the `Window` object aren&#39;t helping us either. For instance, if you type \r\n\r\n    Dim wsv As WorksheetView\r\n    wsv = ActiveWindow.SheetViews.Item(&quot;Sheet1&quot;)\r\n\r\nand then type `wsv.` to look at the available properties in the Intellisense dropdown, you&#39;ll only see the following\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nwhich doesn&#39;t include anything that would do the equivalent of the `View` property for a single worksheet.\r\n\r\n&lt;h2&gt; A potential workaround if the workbook is closed &lt;/h2&gt;\r\nKnowing that the `View` setting is different from one worksheet to another, Excel has to store the information somewhere. That somewhere is the XML file that is included inside the Excel file (that can be accessed by changing the extension to .zip).\r\n\r\nFor example, if a worksheet (with code name Sheet1) was saved in Page Break Preview mode, the XML file for that worksheet would include the following: \r\n\r\n    &lt;sheetPr codeName=&quot;Sheet1&quot;/&gt;&lt;dimension ref=&quot;A1&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/sheetViews&gt;&lt;sheetView tabSelected=&quot;1&quot; view=&quot;pageBreakPreview&quot; workbookViewId=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nSo, if you have a lot of sheets to go through and you want to increase the speed of your code by not having to activate each worksheet one at a time, you could code something that would close the workbook, unzip it, edit the XML to change the view options for all sheets and then re-zip it before reopening it.\r\n\r\nHowever, if your code is running on a small number of sheets, this is probably not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/excel.xlwindowview\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lapwz.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085104/how-to-set-activewindow-view-for-the-non-activesheet/58091639#58091639","title":"How to set ActiveWindow.View for the non activesheet"}],"owner":{"reputation":7719,"user_id":5336948,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YqCFK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Forward Ed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5336948/forward-ed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7719,"user_id":5336948,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YqCFK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Forward Ed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5336948/forward-ed"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58091639,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569388990,"creation_date":1569344602,"last_edit_date":1569345881,"question_id":58085104,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085104","body_markdown":"According to [this article][1] it states that if you are removing existing page breaks you may get an error if the view for the sheet is set to page break preview.

To test the code, I have to scan barcodes.  Most barcode devices these days are HID-class compliant USB devices.  To Windows, they appear as keyboards, which is great for making them instantly compatible with windows software.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is when developers using visual Studio are debugging code that is receiving streams of HID class (keyboard) key press data via the Windows Raw HID Input APIs.\r\n\r\n  When breakpoints are hit, and the IDE pops up and then the barcode scanner CONTINUOUS it&#39;s continous send of key up and key down and key press events, which then causes accidental input of bar-code scanner&#39;s output text into my code (.c and .cpp) files.  \r\n\r\nOn some IDEs you can set the IDE read only during debug so that you have to switch back to edit mode (end debugging) to edit. This would be hugely useful for some users and for some scenarios but appears to be impossible in visual studio.\r\n\r\nSome IDE features around this would be lost if Editing could be disabled, for example, you would be losing edit and continue features. But as I don&#39;t need those features, and would prefer to not have my code be damaged by my barcode scanner activity, having a read only debugger would be useful.\r\n\r\nI am thinking that an IDE Extension that lets me right click and at least mark certain editor buffers as read-only would be useful.  If I figure out how to do that at least, I will update and answer my own question.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other IDEs there are ways to make the IDE set all editor buffers read-only while debugging, so that keys you hit while using the application under test, or in my case, the barrage of key presses coming from a barcode scanner, do not damage your source code.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have to use the editor undo function to recover from this, or I have to set the file to read-only on disk, to prevent this, is there not any way to do this from the IDE?  (Other IDEs do have this feature)\r\n\r\nOr an IDE Plugin that will set focus to some other window than my code, when the IDE pops up at a breakpoint?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085089/debugging-code-in-visual-studio-2017-with-a-barcode-scanner-can-i-set-editor-bu","title":"Debugging Code in Visual Studio 2017 with a Barcode Scanner: Can I set editor buffer read-only somehow?"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","amazon-ec2","amazon-iam"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":7038887,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3acd4a30ef241a4b7f2bbf4aa2d9767?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user135237","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7038887/user135237"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569421360,"post_id":58085248,"comment_id":102592867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085088/is-there-an-os-login-equivalent-in-aws-ec2/58085248#comment102592867_58085248"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26310,"user_id":271415,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8648256cc53b261c5e1d266380a256fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jarmod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/271415/jarmod"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569345248,"creation_date":1569345248,"answer_id":58085248,"question_id":58085088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58085248","body_markdown":"Take a look at [EC2 Instance Connect][1].\r\n\r\n&gt; you can control SSH access to your instances using AWS Identity and\r\n&gt; Access Management (IAM) policies as well as audit connection requests\r\n&gt; with AWS CloudTrail events.

Your `VAR t` is materializing an intermediate table in memory and then iterating that table. We can avoid that intermediate allocation as follows:\r\n\r\n```dax\r\nCountAllVehicleLateEmtracWork =\r\nSUMX (\r\n    VALUES ( &#39;tm-all-late-flag&#39;[Date] ), // VALUES returns the unique values in a column\r\n    // Rather than materializing a new column, we can just return the count inline in\r\n    // the SUMX.\r\n    CALCULATE (\r\n        DISTINCTCOUNT ( &#39;tm-all-late-flag&#39;[tm-all-late-flag-1.emtrac.index] ),\r\n        &#39;tm-all-late-flag&#39;[tm-all-late-flag-1.emtrac.index] &lt;&gt; BLANK (),\r\n        &#39;tm-all-late-flag&#39;[Vehicle-work] &lt;&gt; BLANK ()\r\n    )\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you may want to consider replacing `&#39;Table&#39;[Field] &lt;&gt; BLANK ()` with `NOT ( ISBLANK ( &#39;Table&#39;[Field] ) )`. In DAX, `0 = BLANK ()` evaluates to TRUE. You are excluding both blanks and zeroes.

The whole construct is only useful during development, and its logic will be run with `poetry install`, not `poetry build`.\r\n\r\nWhat *you* want is to bundle the local dependency together with your project so that `pip` will know during a deployment of your project&#39;s `.whl` where to pull the local dependency from. But since `pyproject.toml` does not get packaged together with the wheel metadata, the information where to get dependencies from is no longer available, so it can&#39;t work. A built package only knows what dependencies it has, not where to get them from. This philosophy might be a bit unusual coming from other languages where it is not unusual to bundle all dependencies together with your code. \r\n\r\nSo even if you are able to build your package to include another wheel, which by default doesn&#39;t work because `setuptools` only includes `.py` files in the sdist/bdist by default, there is no way for `pip` to know that the dependency is reachable.\r\nI see four options to solve your problem in a way that python supports.\r\n\r\n 1. Use a version of your `localdep` that is on [pyPI](https://pypi.org/), or upload it there. But if that were a possibility, you would have probably not asked this question.\r\n 2. If `localdep` is under your control and is only used by `mypackage`, write it to be a simple submodule of `mypackage` instead - read, the initial decision to make `localdep` its own package was overengineering, which may or may not be true.\r\n 3. Use a way to vendor `localdep` that python understands. Take [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52538252/import-vendored-dependencies-in-python-package-without-modifying-sys-path-or-3rd) for an in-depth explanation with all the considerations and pitfalls, or [this hacky post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57773454/package-spacy-model/57782864#57782864) if you want to get it to work without needing to really understand why or how.\r\n 4. Deploy your package as a &quot;wheelhouse&quot;.\r\n\r\n----\r\n###What is a wheelhouse?\r\n\r\nThe wheelhouse part needs a little bit more text, but it might be closest to what you initially had in mind. In this approach, you don&#39;t need to include `localdep` in your project, and the whole `mypackage/lib` folder should best be deleted. `localdep` only needs to be installed into your python interpreter, which you can ensure by running `pip freeze` and checking the output for `localdep&#39;s` name and version.\r\n\r\nThat same output will then be used to build said wheelhouse with `pip wheel -w wheelhouse $(pip freeze)`. If you don&#39;t want to include dev dependencies, [delete your current virtualenv](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry/issues/926) and set it up and enter it before running the wheel command with `poetry install; poetry shell` again.\r\n\r\nFor completeness&#39; sake, you can build `dist/myproject.whl` with `poetry build` and throw it in there as well, then you can just use this wheelhouse to install your package wherever you like by running `python -m pip install wheelhouse/*` with whichever `python` you want.\r\n\r\n###Why use pip and not poetry for that?\r\n\r\nPoetry is a dependency manager for developing packages, as such it doesn&#39;t deal with deployment issues as much and only targets them tangentially. This is usually fine, because `pip`, as we saw, is quite capable in that regard. `pip` is not that convenient during development, which is why poetry is nice, but poetry does not completely replace `pip`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085054/building-installable-tar-gz-whl-with-poetry-using-local-dependency/58092909#58092909","title":"Building installable tar.gz/whl with poetry using local dependency"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6908692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/337e8c5150bedf852f9f1b9d997aba4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alimantu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6908692/alimantu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6908692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/337e8c5150bedf852f9f1b9d997aba4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alimantu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6908692/alimantu"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569401545,"creation_date":1569344368,"last_edit_date":1569360028,"question_id":58085054,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085054","body_markdown":"There is following structure in my python project:\r\n```\r\n├───pyproject.toml\r\n└───mypackage\r\n    │\r\n    ├───lib\r\n    │       localdep-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl\r\n    │       localdep-0.2.0.tar.gz\r\n    └───service\r\n            app.py\r\n            home.py\r\n            modules.py\r\n```\r\nI need to build `mypackage` using poetry and local dependency `localdep` from `mypackage/lib/localdep-0.2.0...` to be able to install `mypackage` just using simple `pip install mypackage-0.1.0.tar.gz` command without any additional files.

(see example below)\r\n\r\nI can do this by first sorting the series&#39; index according to the column&#39;s index and then using series.values (see below), but this feels like a workaround and I was wondering if it&#39;s possible to directly assign the series to the column slice.\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    multi_index=pd.MultiIndex.from_product([[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;],[&#39;x&#39;,&#39;y&#39;]])\r\n    df=pd.DataFrame(0,multi_index,[&#39;p&#39;,&#39;q&#39;])\r\n    s1=pd.Series([1,2],[&#39;y&#39;,&#39;x&#39;])\r\n    df.loc[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;p&#39;]=s1[df.loc[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;p&#39;].index].values\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code above gives the desired output, but I was wondering if the last line could be done simpler, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    df.loc[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;p&#39;]=s1\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this sets the column slice to NaNs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDesired output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n         p  q\r\n    a x  2  0\r\n      y  1  0\r\n    b x  0  0\r\n      y  0  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nobtained output from df.loc[&#39;a&#39;,&#39;p&#39;]=s1:\r\n\r\n```\r\n         p  q\r\n    a x  NaN  0\r\n      y  NaN  0\r\n    b x  0.0  0\r\n      y  0.0  0\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems like a simple issue to me but I haven&#39;t been able to find the answer anywhere.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085043/overwrite-slice-of-multi-index-dataframe-with-series","title":"overwrite slice of multi-index dataframe with series"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","dataframe","nlp","nltk"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":825,"user_id":7401546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad2d37c16adb4f0949e663487e9dcf5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Simpl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7401546/simpl"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569347066,"post_id":58085041,"comment_id":102565110,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085041/python-tutorial-help-nlp-customer-reviews#comment102565110_58085041"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12114477,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73262b9ce65f087dcce227a46041884d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheDestoyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114477/thedestoyer"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":825,"user_id":7401546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad2d37c16adb4f0949e663487e9dcf5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Simpl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7401546/simpl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569349350,"post_id":58085041,"comment_id":102566027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085041/python-tutorial-help-nlp-customer-reviews#comment102566027_58085041"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":825,"user_id":7401546,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad2d37c16adb4f0949e663487e9dcf5f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Simpl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7401546/simpl"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569351107,"creation_date":1569351107,"answer_id":58086538,"question_id":58085041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58086538","body_markdown":"From the error message i&#39;d guess that `Hotel_Reviews3.csv` may not have a `&quot;Positive_Review&quot;` column.

Adrian correctly wrote\r\n\r\n&gt; the same way you test anything else\r\n\r\nGiven a slightly modified example of the sample code of the project\r\n\r\n```Golang\r\npackage main\r\n\r\nimport (\r\n  &quot;fmt&quot;\r\n  &quot;log&quot;\r\n  &quot;os&quot;\r\n\r\n  &quot;github.com/urfave/cli&quot;\r\n)\r\n\r\nfunc Friend(c *cli.Context) error {\r\n  fmt.Println(&quot;Hello friend!&quot;)\r\n  return nil\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n  app := cli.NewApp()\r\n  app.Name = &quot;greet&quot;\r\n  app.Usage = &quot;fight the loneliness!&quot;\r\n  app.Action = Friend\r\n\r\n  err := app.Run(os.Args)\r\n  if err != nil {\r\n    log.Fatal(err)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this code actually prints something instead of returning a value you can evaluate, you could use a [testable example](https://blog.golang.org/examples)\r\n\r\n```Golang\r\nfunc ExampleFriend(){\r\n   // Yeah, technically, we can save the error check with the code above\r\n   // but this illustrates how you can make sure the output\r\n   // is not what the testable example expects.\r\n   if err := Friend(nil){\r\n     fmt.Printf(&quot;Friend: %s&quot;,err)\r\n   }\r\n  \r\n  // Output:\r\n  // Hello friend!\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `Action` expects an [`ActionFunc`](https://godoc.org/github.com/urfave/cli#ActionFunc). Where you define that `ActionFunc` is pretty much your thing. It could even come from a different package. So it is your design on how good your application will be testable.\r\n\r\n**Edit** The signature of the value Action expects will change in the future, at least [according to the docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/urfave/cli#App). I already find it questionable to use `interface{}` to be able to pass nil to Action, and then check and type assert for ActionFunc, where a no-op ActionFunc would actually serve the same purpose, but removing an error return value _really_ makes me scratch my head. I strongly recommend to have a look at [alecthomas/kingpin](https://github.com/alecthomas/kingpin) for smaller to medium size applications or [spf13/cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), which is suitable even for the most complex of cli applications.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085039/testing-urfave-cli-based-applications-with-go/58089323#58089323","title":"Testing urfave/cli based applications with go"}],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":302765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897d1c3192a477838482cb4bc567c64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SpankMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302765/spankme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":580,"user_id":302765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3897d1c3192a477838482cb4bc567c64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SpankMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302765/spankme"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569409680,"creation_date":1569344310,"last_edit_date":1569409680,"question_id":58085039,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085039","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a small CLI application in Golang using urfave/cli framework and I&#39;d like to write tests for it, but I can&#39;t find any useful information on how to test CLI applications, specifically written with the urfave/cli library.
