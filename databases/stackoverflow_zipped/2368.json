code you posted does the following:\r\n\r\n1. Converts the `Integer[]` to a `List&lt;Integer&gt;`. So that a `Set` object can be easily constructed out of the `List&lt;Integer&gt;`. This is because the `LinkedHasSet` has a constructor which accepts another `Collection` type and constructs a set from it using its values.\r\n\r\n2. Converts the `List&lt;Integer&gt;` to `LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;` and when that happens, if there were duplicate `Integer`s in the `List&lt;Integer&gt;` as lists can have duplicates, that would be eliminated in the resulting set.\r\n\r\n3. Now in the final step the size of the `LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;` is calculated if the size is not equal to the `length` of the original array `seq` then it means some elements in the `LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;` was duplicate and were removed on conversion.\r\n\r\n&gt; QUESTION: And if the length is not equal to the array seq, then how\r\n&gt; come the elements are unique?\r\n\r\nThat is because if the resulting `LinkedHashSet&lt;Integer&gt;` has fewer elements compared to the initial `Integer[]` then it would mean that  duplicate objects were eliminated. And if they are equal it would mean that no objects were eliminated and all of them were unique.\r\n\r\nIf you want to do the check in fewer lines of code you can do this using the `Streams` API:\r\n\r\n    int[] seq = new int[]{3,2,1,3};\r\n    System.out.println(String.format(&quot;Array has duplicates: %b&quot;, \r\n                       Arrays.stream(seq).distinct().count() != seq.length));\r\n\r\nThis would give you `Array has duplicates: true` as it has duplicates in the `seq` array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974828/checking-unique-values-in-array-using-linkedhashset-in-java/57974929#57974929","title":"Checking unique values in array using LinkedHashSet in java"}],"owner":{"reputation":1055,"user_id":5362583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/644b7f799e5200efb89492146b6f96bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5362583/alok"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1055,"user_id":5362583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/644b7f799e5200efb89492146b6f96bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5362583/alok"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57974882,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568726510,"creation_date":1568725297,"last_edit_date":1568725787,"question_id":57974828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974828","body_markdown":"This is not really a generic question, but yeah.

execute these two tests, JUNIT shows the execution like this:\r\n\r\n    Wikipedia Example\r\n        -&gt; Desktop\r\n            -&gt; chrome\r\n            -&gt; firefox\r\n            -&gt; ie11\r\n        -&gt; Mobile\r\n            -&gt; iphone\r\n            -&gt; android\r\n\r\n**My question:** is there a way to pass those languages also as an `@ValueSource` so I can have the following structure for execution:\r\n\r\n    Wikipedia Example\r\n        -&gt; Desktop\r\n            -&gt; chrome\r\n                -&gt; en\r\n                -&gt; es\r\n            -&gt; firefox\r\n                -&gt; en\r\n                -&gt; es\r\n            -&gt; ie11\r\n                -&gt; en\r\n                -&gt; es\r\n        -&gt; Mobile\r\n            -&gt; iphone\r\n                -&gt; en\r\n                -&gt; es\r\n            -&gt; android\r\n                -&gt; en\r\n                -&gt; es\r\n\r\nThis is not impacting my work so far, but for example, if for some reason the iphone device fails its execution, I need to debug the code in order to check if the error was on the device or if the error was in an specific language, if I can structure like the way I want, it will be easier to identify where is the error. \r\n\r\nAlso, I send the JUNIT execution report to my boss and upload the XML to a JIRA website, so this extra level in the execution hierarchy would be very helpful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974826/using-two-valuesource-in-a-nested-test-with-junit5","title":"Using two @ValueSource in a Nested

is a bug in your application that makes it *not* return the connections to the pool after the transaction is done (a so-called &amp;ldquo;connection leak&amp;rdquo;).\r\n\r\n100 connections is way too big for a connection pool (unless the machine has 100 cores and local SSDs).\r\n\r\nThe idea is that when you want to perform a database transaction, you get a connection from the pool, do your work, commit the transaction and return the connection to the pool. Normally the time an OLTP transaction takes inside the database is so short that you can easily handle thousands of concurrent user sessions that way.\r\n\r\nThis all hinges on the assumption that your transactions are short. If they are not, you may get a problem wil concurrency, because locks are held until a transaction ends. Moreover, long transactions can keep autovacuum from doing its life-saving work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974810/how-dbcontext-and-connections-to-db-should-be-implemented-to-handle-load-testing/57975482#57975482","title":"How DbContext and connections to DB should be implemented to handle load testing?"}],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":1448545,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JaBSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JohnnyBzz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1448545/johnnybzz"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568727392,"creation_date":1568725258,"question_id":57974810,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974810","body_markdown":"I have recently start implementing some load testing.\r\nI am using .NetCore, EF Core 2.2 and Postgres.\r\n\r\nI am calling my test server (with`HttpClient` `client.PostAsync(&quot;/api/resource&quot;);`).\r\n\r\nI found that few of my requests fails because of too many connections (`The connection pool has been exhausted, either raise MaxPoolSize (currently 100) or Timeout (currently 15 seconds)`).

Is it normal that with high load, the requests will fail because of maximum of possible concurrent connections?\r\n2. If above is true - the normal approach is to use `EnableRetryOnFailure`?\r\n3. Is it possible to make other requests to wait in non blocking way (e.g. max 20 seconds) until there are some connections available?\r\n4. Or maybe there is other configuration option (in EF core, or in MVC) to make other requests to wait for available connection (from connection pool) instead of failing with exception?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974810/how-dbcontext-and-connections-to-db-should-be-implemented-to-handle-load-testing","title":"How DbContext and connections to DB should be implemented to handle load testing?"},{"tags":["react-leaflet"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9513698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qWfK7lYcLTk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJM/uofyDRI0pz0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mustapha KAMMOUN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9513698/mustapha-kammoun"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568725256,"creation_date":1568725256,"question_id":57974809,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974809","body_markdown":"I am working on a reactjs mapping using the plugin react-leaflet, I want to build a search bar based on the geojson layers.

You can find documentation here: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick\r\n\r\nThe way I recommend is to use `rebase`.  You can do an interactive rebase, perhaps as simple as\r\n\r\n    git checkout --detach master\r\n    git rebase -i &lt;release_branch&gt;\r\n    git branch -f &lt;release_branch&gt;\r\n\r\nThis will pull up a &quot;to-do list&#39;, which you can edit to suit your needs.  In this case, you can locate the lines representing the commits whose changes you want, and then delete everything else from the todo list.\r\n\r\nDocs: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT** - note that the rebase is done in detached head state, to avoid moving any refs as part of the rebase; and when it&#39;s done you have to update the release branch so it includes the newly copied commits.  These are the &#39;cost&#39; of using rebase for this operation - though depending on preferences there are various ways to address it.  But I still personally find it more user-friendly to do this (so git gives the TODO list I can search through and edit) vs. cherry-pick (which requires me to figure out expressions to identify the commits up front).\r\n\r\nThese methods are in most ways equivalent.  A couple things to note:\r\n\r\nThese commands &quot;copy&quot; the original commit to the new location.  The word &quot;copy&#39; is a little misleading here - a patch is calculated for each commit, representing the changes introduced by that commit; and those patches are applied to the new base to create new commits.\r\n\r\nIn some ways this is like manually applying the changes.  In particular, git won&#39;t &quot;remember&quot; that the new commits are related to the original commits, so if for some reason you later wanted to merge between `master` and the release branch there would be potential conflicts - just as your previous manually-applied changes would likely result in conflicts.\r\n\r\nBut in other ways, this is like doing a weird sort of merge, and that means the cherry-pick or rebase operation itself could generate conflicts (and these aren&#39;t always the most intuitive, though most often they&#39;re not *too* bad as long as you think about what the command is trying to accomplish).\r\n\r\n----\r\n[1] - You can identify individual commits by their SHA ID, or by expressions relative to some ref (such as `master~2` to mean &quot;the 1st parent of `master`s 1st parent&quot;).  You can specify ranges of commits, like `master~6..~master~2`, though cherry-pick is a little funny about ranges.  IF you follow the docs, they&#39;ll take you through many different variations","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974777/git-merge-just-a-range-of-commits/57975144#57975144","title":"GIT merge just a range of commits"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12077919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a5f66f9d4141f83648af3bfcd5eb72e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Korbi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077919/korbi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568731389,"creation_date":1568725170,"last_edit_date":1568731389,"question_id":57974777,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974777","body_markdown":"I want to take over changes from a range of commits. \r\n\r\nThe situation is the following.

have a system which includes Android and iPhone apps as well as a backend server. The applications can send certain sensitive information to one another. In order to do so they generate a keypair when logging in and send the public key to the server. The server then uses that public key to encrypt the sensitive data and only the receiving app can decrypt it using its private key. We currently have it up and running for Android but are facing issues for iPhone. I have looked all over and seen some suggestions but cannot seem to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe public key is sent to and stored on the server as a base64 encoded string and used serverside by \r\n```\r\nbyte[] publicKeyBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedPublicKey);\r\nX509EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes);\r\nKeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;);\r\nPublicKey publicKey = kf.generatePublic(keySpec);\r\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;);\r\ncipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, key);\r\nreturn cipher.doFinal(rawStringToEncrypt.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;));\r\n```\r\nThis works for both iOS and Android. When generating the public key on iOS we needed to add the ASN1 headers etc manually before sending it to the server. But the server now accepts the keys sent from iOS and uses them for encrypting (everything looks OK there). \r\nWhen an Android app receives encrypted data it simply does\r\n```\r\nbyte[] privateKeyBytes = Base64.decodeBase64(base64EncodedPrivateKey.getBytes(&quot;UTF-8&quot;));\r\nPKCS8EncodedKeySpec keySpec = new PKCS8EncodedKeySpec(privateKeyBytes);\r\nKeyFactory kf = KeyFactory.getInstance(&quot;RSA&quot;);\r\nPrivateKey privateKey = kf.generatePrivate(keySpec);\r\nCipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(&quot;RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding&quot;);\r\ncipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, key);\r\nString decryptedString = new String(cipher.doFinal(toDecrypt), &quot;UTF-8&quot;);\r\nreturn decryptedString;\r\n```\r\nwhere it creates its private key from a stored base64 string that it got when generating its key pair. For iOS however, we have tried a large number of different solutions but are never able to decrypt data that the server encrypts with our public key. We generate the KeyPair, manipulate the public key so we can send it to the server and then store our private key. We get the SecKeyRef from our keychain (also has tried to store it as bytes and create it from bytes) and perform ```SecKeyDecrypt``` with that key and have tested both ```kSecPaddingPKCS1``` as well as ```kSecPaddingNone```. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a working solution for decrypting data that a Java server encrypt the way I have described?

After constructing a list, it is cleaner to return it from a function as a vector.\r\n\r\n    L = List([0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/4]);\r\n    listsort(L);\r\n    L\r\n\r\ngives: `List([0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/4])` (incorrect)\r\n\r\n    L = List([0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/4]);\r\n    vecsort(L)\r\n\r\ngives: `List([0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1])` (correct)\r\n\r\nNote that `vecsort` does not modify the original list, so if you want to update the list then you need to assign the output of `vecsort` back to the variable.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would recommend using vectors.\r\n\r\n    L = Vec(List([0, 1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, 2/3, 3/4]));\r\n    vecsort(L)\r\n\r\ngives: `[0, 1/4, 1/3, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 1]` (note the absence of `List`).\r\n\r\nThe underlying reason for this is that `vecsort` uses `lex`, but `listsort` uses `cmp`. I am not sure why `cmp` is so badly behaved - could be a bug, but more likely broken by design.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems that `listsort` sorts in the same order as used by sets and is optimized for performance rather than user expectation. If you wish to use `setsearch` on your list then you need to have it ordered as for sets. There is also a function `vecsearch` that uses `lex` as a comparison function. \r\n\r\nIt is perhaps also worth mentioning that both `vecsort` and `vecsearch` take as an optional argument a user supplied comparison function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974728/how-to-sort-a-list-of-mixed-integers-fractions-in-pari-gp/57982018#57982018","title":"How to sort a list of mixed integers / fractions in pari/gp"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11890049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b43b996113207a99e9f65fc964699e37?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lars Berger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11890049/lars-berger"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11890049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b43b996113207a99e9f65fc964699e37?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lars Berger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11890049/lars-berger"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57982018,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571468029,"creation_date":1568724996,"last_edit_date":1571468029,"question_id":57974728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974728","body_markdown":"Currently I&#39;m implementing an algorithm to return the Farey Series of order n by calling my function with FareySeries(n).

In other words perceived and treated by my mac machine as a completeley different Email Client and doesn&#39;t interact with my current TB Email Client (or its profiles).\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Mac (Yosemite), I&#39;d like to install and *run* two **seperate** Thunderbird apps simultaneously (in parallel) alongside each other (each with their own profile).\r\n\r\nI currently have both regular and Developer Edition Firefox installed. Both can be run at the same time with no issues related to profiles/instances (they both have unique dedicated profiles at different locations). **I&#39;d like to replicate this concept/setup with TB** e.g. Regular TB + Own build TB (which is pretty much the exact same as the regular).\r\n\r\nThere are many benefits to this incl. having separate profiles for business and personal and being able to use them (open and run them) at the same instance. Also, I don&#39;t want to install and update my current TB V52 to V68 in case it crashes and I lose some data (I&#39;ve numerous email accounts configured on it). There are other benefits and I can explain if needed.\r\n\r\n**I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that** I should be able to do this by building/forking Thunderbird and then tweaking/changing some code. *This is so that when I install it, it&#39;s installed as a completely seperate app with no conflict/sharing of profiles with the regular/original TB I have installed at the moment.* I.e. this tweaked build/fork would have it&#39;s own app name, logo and dedicated profile (default profile&#39;s location would be unique too). \r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing I should start with the following to create a new build and then figure which line of code I need to tweak to achieve my objective mentioned above:\r\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Simple_Thunderbird_build -if however, there is an easier way, please share.\r\n\r\nNb. I&#39;ve read that Firefox is implementing/has implemented a Dedicated Profile feature (https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/dedicated-profiles-firefox-installation), which is the same or similar to what I&#39;m enquiring about above. However, I know TB development is independent from Firefox development. So I&#39;m not sure when they&#39;ll implement the same/similar and don&#39;t if this feature enables exactly what I need.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also enquired about this in the TB Support Forum a while back. They initially suggested specifying profiles on startup but then acklnowledged a problematic issue I&#39;d identified. Therefore I would like have two seperate apps to avoid any problematic issues that may arise with having one app with multiple profiles:\r\nhttps://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1265160\r\n\r\n\r\nTo summarise that support forum post:\r\nI know I can use Terminal on Mac to specify profiles similar to in Firefox e.g. \r\n\r\n```open /Applications/Firefoxquantum.app --args -P Firefoxquantumprofile```\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;ve ran into issues –\r\nSometimes  when clicking on an out-of-browser web-link, there seems to be a mix-up of profiles and consequently the old Firefox profile gets corrupted. I lost some add-ons, add-on settings, bookmarks and some other damage too. I&#39;m worried something similar may happen if I tried with TB and happened to click on an out-of-client email link, consequently calling up the wrong profile or corrupting one of the profiles.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974727/create-fork-build-an-identical-copy-of-thunderbird-with-dedicated-profile-s","title":"Create (fork/build) an identical copy of Thunderbird with dedicated profile -- similar to Firefox Developer Edition"},{"tags":["hibernate","spring-data-jpa"],"owner":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5559599,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa5e096bf8306e5d66befbedb846700e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"m52509791","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5559599/m52509791"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568724990,"creation_date":1568724990,"question_id":57974726,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974726","body_markdown":"I noticed that Spring Data Jpa ignors Hiberbate annotations located in package-info.java files - do you know why?\nI have @TypeDef annotation defined and it only works when it is located in the entity class, it does not work when it is placed in package-info.java file.

have a dataframe that looks as follow (click on the lick below):\r\n\r\n    df.head(10)\r\n\r\nhttps://ibb.co/vqmrkXb\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is to remove outliers from the target column (occupied_parking_spaces) when the value of the day column is equal to 6 for instance which refers to sunday (df[‘day’] == 6) using the normal distribution 68-95-99.7 rule.\r\n \r\nI tried the following code :\r\n\r\n    df = df.mask((df[&#39;occupied_parking_spaces&#39;] - df[&#39;occupied_parking_spaces&#39;].mean()).abs() &gt; 2 * df[&#39;occupied_parking_spaces&#39;].std()).dropna()\r\n\r\nThis line of code removes outliers from the whole dataset no matter the independent variables but I only want to remove outliers from the occupied_parking_spacs column where the day value is equal to 6 for exemple.\r\n\r\nWhat I can do is to create a different dataframe for which I will remove outliers:\r\n\r\n    sunday_df = df.loc[df[&#39;day&#39;] == 0]\r\n\r\n    sunday_df = sunday_df.mask((sunday_df[&#39;occupied_parking_spaces&#39;] - sunday_df[&#39;occupied_parking_spaces&#39;].mean()).abs() &gt; 2 *

can use a ``for`` loop to successively try variants:\r\n\r\n    for task, error in ((find_record, NoSuchRecord), (create_record, CreateFailed)):\r\n        try:\r\n            result = task()\r\n        except error:\r\n            continue\r\n        else:\r\n            break\r\n    else:\r\n        # for..else is only entered if there was no break\r\n        result = tape\r\n\r\nIf you need an ``else`` clause, you can provide it as a separate function:\r\n\r\n    for task, error, success in (\r\n        (find_record, NoSuchRecord, lambda: logger.info(&quot;Record found&quot;)),\r\n

If I need to get a record I can first try to find the record, and if this fails, I can create the missing record, and if this also fails, I can use a tape instead.\r\n\r\nFailing is represented by throwing an exception my code needs to catch.\r\n\r\nIn Python this looks something like this:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n  record = find_record()\r\nexcept NoSuchRecord:\r\n  try:\r\n    record = create_record()\r\n  except CreateFailed:\r\n    record = tape\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis already has the disadvantage of piling-up indentations.

(Moving the code of the `else` clause directly into the `try` clause is only an option if this code is definitely not raising one of the exceptions caught in the `except` statement, so this is no general solution.)\r\n\r\nAgain, this ugliness gets worse with each added level of nesting.\r\n\r\nIs there a nicer way to put this into Python code\r\n\r\n 1. without changing the behavior and\r\n 2. while keeping the `try` and the `except` clauses of one topic closely together and/or\r\n 3. maybe also avoiding the piling-up nesting and indenting?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974694/how-to-improve-code-clarity-in-nested-try-except-else-clauses","title":"How to improve code clarity in nested try-except-else clauses?"},{"tags":["nhibernate","queryover"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":11482040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78e97145ede0f79467013cf464db3308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andr&#233; Sanson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11482040/andr%c3%a9-sanson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568822781,"post_id":57974691,"comment_id":102400195,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974691/is-it-possible-to-order-a-query-based-on-a-nhibernate-multi-column-user-type-pr#comment102400195_57974691"},{"owner":{"reputation":810,"user_id":1090923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UPau.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rheone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1090923/rheone"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":194,"user_id":11482040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78e97145ede0f79467013cf464db3308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andr&#233; Sanson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11482040/andr%c3%a9-sanson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568866602,"post_id":57974691,"comment_id":102412282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974691/is-it-possible-to-order-a-query-based-on-a-nhibernate-multi-column-user-type-pr#comment102412282_57974691"},{"owner":{"reputation":194,"user_id":11482040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78e97145ede0f79467013cf464db3308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andr&#233; Sanson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11482040/andr%c3%a9-sanson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568922847,"post_id":57974691,"comment_id":102439807,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974691/is-it-possible-to-order-a-query-based-on-a-nhibernate-multi-column-user-type-pr#comment102439807_57974691"},{"owner":{"reputation":810,"user_id":1090923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UPau.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rheone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1090923/rheone"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":194,"user_id":11482040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/78e97145ede0f79467013cf464db3308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andr&#233; Sanson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11482040/andr%c3%a9-sanson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569002710,"post_id":57974691,"comment_id":102468634,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974691/is-it-possible-to-order-a-query-based-on-a-nhibernate-multi-column-user-type-pr#comment102468634_57974691"}],"owner":{"reputation":810,"user_id":1090923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UPau.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rheone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1090923/rheone"},"last_editor":{"reputation":810,"user_id":1090923,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9UPau.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rheone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1090923/rheone"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568913213,"creation_date":1568724906,"last_edit_date":1568913213,"question_id":57974691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974691","body_markdown":"I have a fluent mapped a database table that uses two columns to represent an IP Address.

There are two ways how to propagate your data to screen with RecyclerView.\r\n\r\n 1. For each data type create UI component with header like `class CurrentItem(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView), DataTypeItem`. *DataTypeItem* is interface for each data type. Than create `RecyclerView` and to in the adapter `RecyclerView.Adapter&lt;DataTypeItem&gt;`. Now your adapter is able to show all your data types with interface `DataTypeItem`. In adapter override method `onBindViewHolder(holder: DataTypeItem, position: Int)` and re-type holder to `CurrentItem`. On the end propagate your incoming data to UI component.\r\n 2.

By default, CockroachDB stores timeseries data for the last 30 days for display in the Admin UI, but you can reduce the interval for timeseries storage or disable timeseries storage entirely.\r\n\r\n## Reduce the interval for timeseries storage\r\n\r\nTo reduce the interval for storage of timeseries data, change the `timeseries.storage.resolution_10s.ttl` cluster setting to an `INTERVAL` value less than `720h0m0s` (30 days). For example, to store timeseries data for the last 15 days, run the following `SET CLUSTER SETTING` command:\r\n\r\n    SET CLUSTER SETTING timeseries.storage.resolution_10s.ttl = &#39;360h0m0s&#39;;\r\n\r\n## Disable timeseries storage entirely \r\n\r\n**Note:** Disabling timeseries storage entirely is recommended only if you exclusively use a third-party tool such as Prometheus for timeseries monitoring. Prometheus and other such tools do not rely on CockroachDB-stored timeseries data; instead, they ingest metrics exported by CockroachDB from memory and then store the data themselves.\r\n\r\nTo disable the storage of timeseries data entirely, run the following command:\r\n\r\n    SET CLUSTER SETTING timeseries.storage.enabled = false;\r\n\r\nIf you want all existing timeseries data to be deleted, change the `timeseries.storage.resolution_10s.ttl` cluster setting as well:\r\n\r\n    SET CLUSTER SETTING timeseries.storage.resolution_10s.ttl = &#39;0s&#39;;\r\n\r\nFurther reference: https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/operational-faqs.html#can-i-reduce-or-disable-the-storage-of-timeseries-data","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974646/can-i-decrease-usage-of-non-table-cluster-data-on-my-cockroach-cluster/58218467#58218467","title":"Can I decrease usage of Non-Table Cluster Data on my cockroach cluster?"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":11073131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NvFpu4uUg6A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOw/MYnlw0Rtjqk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ueda Takeyuki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11073131/ueda-takeyuki"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58218467,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570103221,"creation_date":1568724776,"question_id":57974646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974646","body_markdown":"On my cockroachDB cluster, the **Time Series** data grows up to about 1 GByte.\r\nIs there any way to decrease it?

you can use OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow and Service Accounts.\r\n\r\nKeycloak suggest 3 ways to secure SpringBoot REST services:\r\n\r\n 1. with Keycloak Spring Boot Adapter\r\n 2. with keycloak Spring Security Adapter\r\n 3. with OAuth2 / OpenID Connect\r\n\r\nHere is a good explanation about this with an example in the OAuth2/OIDC way:\r\n\r\n* [Tutorial by Arun B Chandrasekaran][1]\r\n* \r\n[Code sample by Arun B Chandrasekaran][2]\r\n\r\nIf you follow this example, keep in mind:\r\n\r\nTake care to configure your client as:\r\n\r\n - Access Type: Confidential\r\n - Authorization: Enabled\r\n - Service Account (OAuth Client Credentials Flow): Enabled\r\n\r\nTake care to configure your target service as:\r\n\r\n - Access Type: Bearer-only\r\n\r\nSo, caller should be `confidential` and target service should be `bearer-only`.\r\n\r\nCreate your users, roles, mappers... and assign roles to your users.\r\n\r\nCheck that you have this dependencies in your spring project:\r\n\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n      &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-security&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n    &lt;dependency&gt;\r\n      &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.security.oauth.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n      &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n    &lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\nConfigure authentication to be used in the REST client (application.properties)\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n    security.oauth2.client.client-id=employee-service\r\n    security.oauth2.client.client-secret=68977d81-c59b-49aa-aada-58da9a43a850\r\n    security.oauth2.client.user-authorization-uri=${rest.security.issuer-uri}/protocol/openid-connect/auth\r\n    security.oauth2.client.access-token-uri=${rest.security.issuer-uri}/protocol/openid-connect/token\r\n    security.oauth2.client.scope=openid\r\n    security.oauth2.client.grant-type=client_credentials\r\n\r\nImplement your `JwtAccessTokenCustomizer` and `SecurityConfigurer`  (ResourceServerConfigurerAdapter) like Arun&#39;s sample.\r\n\r\nAnd finally implement your service Controller:\r\n\r\n    @RestController\r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/api/v1/employees&quot;)\r\n    public class EmployeeRestController {\r\n    \r\n      @GetMapping(path = &quot;/username&quot;)\r\n      @PreAuthorize(&quot;hasAnyAuthority(&#39;ROLE_USER&#39;)&quot;)\r\n      public ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; getAuthorizedUserName() {\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(SecurityContextUtils.getUserName());\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      @GetMapping(path = &quot;/roles&quot;)\r\n      @PreAuthorize(&quot;hasAnyAuthority(&#39;ROLE_USER&#39;)&quot;)\r\n      public ResponseEntity&lt;Set&lt;String&gt;&gt; getAuthorizedUserRoles() {\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(SecurityContextUtils.getUserRoles());\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor a complete tutorial, please read the referred Arun&#39;s tutorial.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

@dmitri-algazin you to implement the workflow you have basically two options:\r\n\r\n1. If you want to cover other IdMs besides Keycloak which solves somehow the [Single Responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle), I would use `RestTemplate`. Below you can find the variables:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t//Constants\r\n\t@Value(&quot;${keycloak.url}&quot;)\r\n    private String keycloakUrl;\r\n\t\r\n\t@Value(&quot;${keycloak.realm}&quot;)\r\n    private String keycloakRealm;\r\n\t\r\n\t@Value(&quot;${keycloak.client_id}&quot;)\r\n    private String keycloakClientId;\r\n\t\r\n\tRestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();\r\n\tprivate static final String BEARER = &quot;BEARER &quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst you need to generate the access token:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic AccessTokenResponse login(KeycloakUser user) throws NotAuthorizedException {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tString uri = keycloakUrl + &quot;/realms/&quot; + keycloakRealm + \r\n\t\t\t\t\t&quot;/protocol/openid-connect/token&quot;;\r\n\t\t\tString data = &quot;grant_type=password&amp;username=&quot;+\r\n\t\t\t\t\tuser.getUsername()+&quot;&amp;password=&quot;+user.getPassword()+&quot;&amp;client_id=&quot;+\r\n\t\t\t\t\tkeycloakClientId;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tHttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();\r\n\t\t\theaders.set(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\tHttpEntity&lt;String&gt; entity = new HttpEntity&lt;String&gt;(data, headers);\r\n\t\t\tResponseEntity&lt;AccessTokenResponse&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(uri, \r\n\t\t\t\t\tHttpMethod.POST, entity, AccessTokenResponse.class);\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t   \t\tif (response.getStatusCode().value() != HttpStatus.SC_OK) {\r\n\t    \t\tlog.error(&quot;Unauthorised access to protected resource&quot;, response.getStatusCode().value());\r\n\t    \t\tthrow new NotAuthorizedException(&quot;Unauthorised access to protected resource&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\treturn response.getBody();\r\n\t\t} catch (Exception ex) {\r\n    \t\tlog.error(&quot;Unauthorised access to protected resource&quot;, ex);\r\n    \t\tthrow new NotAuthorizedException(&quot;Unauthorised access to protected resource&quot;);\r\n\t\t} \r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then with the token you can retrieve information from the users:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t@Override\r\n\tpublic String user(String authToken) throws NotAuthorizedException {\r\n        \r\n        if (! authToken.toUpperCase().startsWith(BEARER)) {\r\n            throw new NotAuthorizedException(&quot;Invalid OAuth Header. Missing Bearer prefix&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();\r\n        headers.set(&quot;Authorization&quot;, authToken);\r\n\r\n        HttpEntity&lt;String&gt; entity = new HttpEntity&lt;&gt;(headers);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tResponseEntity&lt;AccessToken&gt; response = restTemplate.exchange(\r\n\t\t\t\tkeycloakUrl + &quot;/realms/&quot; + keycloakRealm + &quot;/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo&quot;, \r\n\t\t\t\tHttpMethod.POST, \r\n\t\t\t\tentity, \r\n\t\t\t\tAccessToken.class);\r\n\r\n   \t\tif (response.getStatusCode().value() != HttpStatus.SC_OK) {\r\n            log.error(&quot;OAuth2 Authentication failure. &quot;\r\n            \t\t+ &quot;Invalid OAuth Token supplied in Authorization Header on Request. Code {}&quot;, response.getStatusCode().value());\r\n    \t\tthrow new NotAuthorizedException(&quot;OAuth2 Authentication failure. &quot;\r\n    \t\t\t\t+ &quot;Invalid OAuth Token supplied in Authorization Header on Request.&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n   \t\t\r\n\t\tlog.debug(&quot;User info: {}&quot;, response.getBody().getPreferredUsername());\r\n   \t\treturn response.getBody().getPreferredUsername();\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can substitute this URL by the one provided by @dimitri-algazin to retrieve all the users information.\r\n\r\n2. It is possible to use the Keycloak dependencies:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t&lt;!-- keycloak --&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.keycloak&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;keycloak-admin-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;3.4.3.Final&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;dependency&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;groupId&gt;org.jboss.resteasy&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;artifactId&gt;resteasy-client&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;version&gt;3.1.4.Final&lt;/version&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/dependency&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use the classes to generate the token:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\t    Keycloak keycloak = KeycloakBuilder\r\n\t\t            .builder()\r\n\t\t            .serverUrl(keycloakUrl)\r\n\t\t            .realm(keycloakRealm)\r\n\t\t            .username(user.getUsername())\r\n\t\t            .password(user.getPassword())\r\n\t\t            .clientId(keycloakClientId)\r\n\t\t            .resteasyClient(new ResteasyClientBuilder().connectionPoolSize(10).build())\r\n\t\t            .build();\r\n\r\n\t\t\treturn keycloak.tokenManager().getAccessToken();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe examples are extracted from [here](https://github.com/AriHealth/keycloak-auth). We also uploaded the [image to Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/arihealth/oauth-easy) to facilitate the interaction with Keycloak. For this reason we started with option 2). Right now we are in the process to cover other IdMs and we went for option 1) in order to avoid including extra dependencies. Conclusion:\r\n\r\n&gt; I would go for **option 2** if you stick to Keycloak because classes include extra functionalities for Keycloak tool.\r\n&gt; I would go for **option 1** for further coverage and other OAuth 2.0 tools.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974630/oauth2-client-credentials-flow-via-spring-boot-keycloak-integration/58117735#58117735","title":"OAuth2 client credentials flow via Spring Boot Keycloak integration"}],"owner":{"reputation":1890,"user_id":1063673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1e67c95c89704f9d49b73538dc3f36c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steffen Harbich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1063673/steffen-harbich"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1890,"user_id":1063673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1e67c95c89704f9d49b73538dc3f36c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steffen Harbich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1063673/steffen-harbich"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":253,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58117735,"answer_count":3,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1569587928,"creation_date":1568724696,"last_edit_date":1569587928,"question_id":57974630,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974630","body_markdown":"My application consists of:\r\n\r\n - backend/resource server\r\n - UI webapp\r\n - keycloak\r\n\r\nThe UI is talking with the backend server via RESTful API using the keycloak client with authorization code grant flow.

Or do I have to check and add them manually?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974628/best-practice-to-check-and-add-missing-stores-in-dexie-js","title":"Best practice to check and add missing stores in Dexie.js"},{"tags":["node.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":231,"user_id":11580357,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47899e53c90d60390ab4161eee7915fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Corrie MacDonald","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11580357/corrie-macdonald"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568725988,"creation_date":1568725988,"answer_id":57975041,"question_id":57974625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57975041","body_markdown":"I assume your callback arguments are variable and that the function is defined in an isolated manner (where it can&#39;t access scope beyond itself, and that you don&#39;t want to mutate the callback function&#39;s underlying data.

In training, it uses the average and variance of the current mini-batch to scale its inputs; this means that the exact result of the application of batch normalization depends not only on the current input, but also on all other elements of the mini-batch. This is clearly not desirable when in inference mode, where we want a deterministic result. Therefore, in that case, a fixed statistic of the global average and variance over the entire training set is used.\r\n\r\nIn Tensorflow, this behavior is controlled by a boolean switch `training` that needs to be specified when calling the layer, see https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization. How do I deal with this switch when using Keras high-level API? Am I correct in assuming that it is dealt with automatically, depending whether we are using `model.fit(x, ...)` or `model.predict(x, ...)`?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nTo test this, I have written this example. We start with a random distribution and we want to classify whether the input is positive or negative. However, we also have a test dataset coming from a different distribution where the inputs are displaced by 2 (and consequently the labels check whether x&gt;2).\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    from math import ceil\r\n    from tensorflow.python.data import Dataset\r\n    from tensorflow.python.keras import Input, Model\r\n    from tensorflow.python.keras.layers import Dense, BatchNormalization\r\n    \r\n    np.random.seed(18)\r\n    xt = np.random.randn(10_000, 1)\r\n    yt = np.array([[int(x &gt; 0)] for x in xt])\r\n    train_data = Dataset.from_tensor_slices((xt, yt)).shuffle(10_000).repeat().batch(32).prefetch(2)\r\n    \r\n    xv = np.random.randn(100, 1)\r\n    yv = np.array([[int(x &gt; 0)] for x in xv])\r\n    valid_data = Dataset.from_tensor_slices((xv, yv)).repeat().batch(32).prefetch(2)\r\n    \r\n    xs = np.random.randn(100, 1) + 2\r\n    ys = np.array([[int(x &gt; 2)] for x in xs])\r\n    test_data = Dataset.from_tensor_slices((xs, ys)).repeat().batch(32).prefetch(2)\r\n    \r\n    x = Input(shape=(1,))\r\n    a = BatchNormalization()(x)\r\n    a = Dense(8, activation=&#39;sigmoid&#39;)(a)\r\n    a = BatchNormalization()(a)\r\n    y = Dense(1, activation=&#39;sigmoid&#39;)(a)\r\n    model = Model(inputs=x, outputs=y, )\r\n    model.summary()\r\n    \r\n    model.compile(loss=&#39;binary_crossentropy&#39;, optimizer=&#39;adam&#39;, metrics=[&#39;accuracy&#39;])\r\n    model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, steps_per_epoch=ceil(10_000 / 32), validation_data=valid_data,\r\n              validation_steps=ceil(100 / 32))\r\n    zs = model.predict(test_data, steps=ceil(100 / 32))\r\n    print(sum([ys[i] == int(zs[i] &gt; 0.5) for i in range(100)]))\r\n\r\nRunning the code prints the value 0.5, meaning that half the examples are labeled properly. This is what I would expect if the system was using the global statistics on the training set to implement BN.\r\n\r\nIf we change the BN layers to read\r\n\r\n    x = Input(shape=(1,))\r\n    a = BatchNormalization()(x, training=True)\r\n    a = Dense(8, activation=&#39;sigmoid&#39;)(a)\r\n    a = BatchNormalization()(a, training=True)\r\n    y = Dense(1, activation=&#39;sigmoid&#39;)(a)\r\n\r\nand run the code again we find 0.87. Forcing always the training state, the percentage of correct prediction has changed. This is consistent with the idea that `model.predict(x, ...)` is now using the statistic of the mini-batch to implement BN, and is therefore able to slightly &quot;correct&quot; the mismatch in the source distributions between training and test data.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974605/how-to-implement-batch-normalization-on-tensorflow-with-keras-as-a-high-level-ap","title":"How to implement Batch Normalization on tensorflow with Keras as a high-level API"},{"tags":["kubernetes","amazon-elb","eks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11006755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-A_JWwHBtEsU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAc/AklupJgnflg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Fernando Battistella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11006755/fernando-battistella"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568727187,"creation_date":1568727187,"answer_id":57975415,"question_id":57974599,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57975415","body_markdown":"Thats the default behaviour for the elb/nlb, once traffic hits the instances kube-proxy will redirect it to the instances with your pods running.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using the alb ingress controller, then again its standard behaviour, it will only add the instances were your pods are running, skipping the iptables mumbo jumbo ;) ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974599/eks-elb-odd-instances-in-the-list/57975415#57975415","title":"EKS ELB: odd instances in the list"}],"owner":{"reputation":685,"user_id":5309594,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd7ed90f02f74f12b018acb3ff69dac8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"malyy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5309594/malyy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57975415,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568727187,"creation_date":1568724618,"question_id":57974599,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974599","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve configured application to run on 2 ec2 instances and k8s service `type = LoadBalancer` for this application (`Selector:app=some-app`).

It preserves directories because a `fileTree` is used, which only collects files.\r\n\r\nThe **long** answer:\r\n\r\nYour first example mixes the two ways to delete files in Gradle. The first one is to use a task of type `Delete`, the second one is to invoke the method `delete` of the type `Project`. But how to they differ and why are they mixed in your example?\r\n\r\nGradle is based on its task system that allows to define and configure tasks which are only run if necessary. Whether a task is required for the build will be determined from task dependencies (`dependsOn`). This is the reason why Gradle distinguishes between the *configuration phase* and the *execution phase*. During configuration phase, the whole build script gets executed except the actual task actions (not visible in the build script) and code wrapped in `doFirst` / `doLast` closures. During execution phase, each required task gets run by Gradle. This involved executing the `doFirst` closures of the task, then the actual task actions and in the end the `doLast` closures of the task. Now for a `Delete` task like the one above this means, that the code in the configuration closure `delete &#39;src/main/gen&#39;` gets executed during configuration phase, but the actual deletion of the files (the task action) happens later on, during execution phase.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach arises when its required to delete files directly or all the time (e.g. in a plugin or another scenario). It would be too complicated to create a ask, setup the dependencies and so on. Here comes the method `delete` of the type `Project` to the rescue. It provides the same interface for configuration as the task type `Delete`, but executes directly. It can be called via the project instance (e.g. `project.delete &#39;src/main/gen&#39;`) everywhere in your script and runs instantly, but because the `project` instance is used as scope of the whole script, just using `delete` is sufficient, too. Well, it is not always sufficient. If the current scope provides a method called `delete` (with the same signature), this method will be used instead. This is the case inside a task of type `Delete` and this is the reason why your first script does not work:\r\n\r\nYour task of type `Delete` gets configured in the `doLast` closure, which runs **after** the actual deletion should have taken place. If you remove the `type: Delete`, the method `delete` will no longer configure the task, but instead delete the files instantly because it is no longer the method `delete` of the task `Delete`, but the method `delete` of the type `Project`. This works fine, but using a *real* task should be preferred.\r\n\r\nIf you remove the `type: Delete` from your second example, the same thing will happen. Instead of configuring the task, the files will be deleted instantly (now during configuration phase). You do not want this behavior, because the task will be obsolete, since the files will be deleted every time Gradle is invoked. This is what you mentioned as a possible problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974585/confused-about-gradle-delete-task/57977123#57977123","title":"Confused about Gradle delete task"}],"owner":{"reputation":1485,"user_id":136449,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd8f0993b3bc2a15bcd9c7a2961493c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/136449/steve"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568732561,"creation_date":1568724584,"question_id":57974585,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57974585","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently learning Gradle, so this is probably a simple question but I can&#39;t seem to understand.\r\n\r\nI need to create a task in my gradle build that deletes a set of intermediate files. So after a bunch of Google&#39;ing, I tried the following:\r\n```\r\ntask deleteTest (type: Delete) {\r\n    doLast {\r\n        delete fileTree (&#39;src/main/gen&#39;) {\r\n            include &#39;**/*&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has no effect, since when I run the task all of the files in the &#39;src/main/gen&#39; directory still exist. From reading various websites, it seemed like this was the correct approach, but it just doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nJust for grins, I tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntask deleteTest (type: Delete) {\r\n    delete fileTree (&#39;src/main/gen&#39;) {\r\n        include &#39;**/*&#39;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to work, all of the files get removed from the directory(although it leaves empty sub-directories, which I also don&#39;t understand). But from what I read, this is not the correct way to go, since it executes during configuration, not during execution. \r\n\r\nCan someone please explain this to me?

Below is an example of what I&#39;ve done.\r\n\r\nView:\r\n```\r\n&lt;form asp-action=&quot;Save&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submitType&quot; value=&quot;Save&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; name=&quot;submitType&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-primary&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n        $(document).ready(function () {\r\n            $( &quot;form&quot; ).submit(function (e) {\r\n                e.preventDefault();\r\n                var submitClicked = $(&quot;input[type=submit][clicked=true]&quot;).val();\r\n                if ($(this).valid()) {\r\n                    if (submitClicked == &quot;Save&quot;) {\r\n                        $(&quot;form&quot;).unbind(&#39;submit&#39;).submit();\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n                    if (submitClicked == &quot;Submit&quot;) {\r\n                        if (confirm(&quot;Are you sure you are ready to Submit your document for Approval?&quot;)) {\r\n                            $(&quot;form&quot;).unbind(&#39;submit&#39;).submit();\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n            $(&quot;form input[type=submit]&quot;).click(function () {\r\n                $(&quot;input[type=submit]&quot;, $(this).parents(&quot;form&quot;)).removeAttr(&quot;clicked&quot;);\r\n                $(this).attr(&quot;clicked&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\nController:\r\n```\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Save(Document document, string submitType)\r\n{\r\n     if (submitType == &quot;Submit&quot;)\r\n     {\r\n          document.ApprovalLevel = 1;\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the confirmation works without flaw, but for some reason when using preventDefault() with unbind().submit() it removes the input value for the submit button so I get a null value for submitType in the controller and consequently the submit fails. When I remove the jquery bit that posits the confirmation question, the input value for the submit button passes without fail. How can I achieve a solution where the confirmation question works while still knowing which button was used to submit to the controller.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974579/using-net-core-mvc-how-to-pass-value-of-submit-button-to-controller-while-h","title":"Using .Net Core MVC, How to pass value of Submit &quot;button&quot; to controller, while having a confirmation dialog?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","flask","python-requests"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8048863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vpFx7-BY7bg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFMI/aTl2o2Yd2WI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anshal Lad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8048863/anshal-lad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568725900,"post_id":57974856,"comment_id":102359609,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974575/is-there-a-way-to-send-a-file-using-post-from-a-python-script-with-specific-nam/57974856#comment102359609_57974856"},{"owner":{"reputation":1052,"user_id":12048071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ba9d052fccefb4dd1e6e4a38af5a819?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stasiekz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12048071/stasiekz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8048863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vpFx7-BY7bg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFMI/aTl2o2Yd2WI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anshal Lad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8048863/anshal-lad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568726646,"post_id":57974856,"comment_id":102360117,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57974575/is-there-a-way-to-send-a-file-using-post-from-a-python-script-with-specific-nam/57974856#comment102360117_57974856"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1052,"user_id":12048071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ba9d052fccefb4dd1e6e4a38af5a819?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stasiekz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12048071/stasiekz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1052,"user_id":12048071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ba9d052fccefb4dd1e6e4a38af5a819?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stasiekz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12048071/stasiekz"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568726630,"last_edit_date":1568726630,"creation_date":1568725409,"answer_id":57974856,"question_id":57974575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57974856","body_markdown":"Try `resume = request.files.get(&#39;resume.pdf&#39;)`.
