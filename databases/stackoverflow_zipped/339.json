Thanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457616/how-to-count-the-difference-between-the-start-date-and-end-date-for-each-user-id","title":"How to count the difference between the start date and end date for each user_ID"},{"tags":["php","file-upload","watermark"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":137,"user_id":11222393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/841995c873cf08b8f6a6e847f889b2fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user11222393","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11222393/user11222393"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571430276,"post_id":58457614,"comment_id":103252455,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php#comment103252455_58457614"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":3898377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf5e48b5f2ba071cebd957d704f468e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Midhat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3898377/midhat"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":137,"user_id":11222393,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/841995c873cf08b8f6a6e847f889b2fb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user11222393","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11222393/user11222393"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571431291,"post_id":58457614,"comment_id":103252816,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php#comment103252816_58457614"},{"owner":{"reputation":1415,"user_id":2862341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b47330aa26f09e1756b4cd2df92af4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ravindra HV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2862341/ravindra-hv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571441241,"post_id":58457614,"comment_id":103255159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php#comment103255159_58457614"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":3898377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf5e48b5f2ba071cebd957d704f468e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Midhat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3898377/midhat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571432224,"post_id":58457924,"comment_id":103253120,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php/58457924#comment103253120_58457924"},{"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":8180429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-orcJE1uHJnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMY/iJm_Pjt0ZD0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sajib Talukder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8180429/sajib-talukder"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17,"user_id":3898377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf5e48b5f2ba071cebd957d704f468e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Midhat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3898377/midhat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571432887,"post_id":58457924,"comment_id":103253333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php/58457924#comment103253333_58457924"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":3898377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf5e48b5f2ba071cebd957d704f468e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Midhat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3898377/midhat"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434342,"post_id":58457924,"comment_id":103253772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457614/problem-with-watermark-jpg-images-in-php/58457924#comment103253772_58457924"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":8180429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-orcJE1uHJnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMY/iJm_Pjt0ZD0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sajib Talukder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8180429/sajib-talukder"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64,"user_id":8180429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-orcJE1uHJnc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAMY/iJm_Pjt0ZD0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sajib Talukder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8180429/sajib-talukder"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571431709,"last_edit_date":1571431709,"creation_date":1571431289,"answer_id":58457924,"question_id":58457614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58457924","body_markdown":"Since strtolower  does not work.\r\nUse if/else condition like this way_ \r\n\r\n    if(preg_match(&#39;/[.](jpg)$/i&#39;, $file_name)) {  \r\n        $im = imagecreatefromjpeg($targetFilePath);

I can&#39;t use a constraint layout because this modal pop-up view is not a child of the same view parent. So I&#39;m trying to dynamically update my scroll views layout params so its height is small enough to not get hidden behind the modal pop-up. \r\n\r\nThe pop-up view height can change at points so I have a callback that returns the new height of the modal view anytime it changes. In that callback I adjust the scroll views height like so:\r\n\r\n    someModalView.onHeightChanged = { newViewHeight -&gt;\r\n        Log.d(&quot;TESTHEIGHT&quot;, &quot;PreHeight = ${scrollView.height}&quot;)\r\n        scrollView.layoutParams = FrameLayout.LayoutParams(scrollView.width, scrollView.height - newViewHeight)\r\n        scrollView.requestLayout()\r\n        Log.d(&quot;TESTHEIGHT&quot;, &quot;PostHeight = ${scrollView.height}&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the above code seems to do nothing and in my logs I can see that the PreHeight prints the same height as the PostHeight. Any reason the views height isn&#39;t getting changed?\r\n\r\nAlso, I did debug it and make sure that newViewHeight is not 0, and it isn&#39;t, it&#39;s ~800\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nEnded up making it work by adding padding to the view rather than changing its height like so:\r\n\r\n    someModalView.onHeightChanged = { newViewHeight -&gt;\r\n        scrollView.setPadding(0, 0, 0, newViewHeight)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works exactly how i needed it to, however it doesn&#39;t really answer the question so I will just leave it in the answer for anyone else who it might help.

Any suggestions how I can fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457587/how-to-add-hovertool-for-just-one-of-multiple-datasets-when-plotting-using-bokeh","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"How to add hovertool for just one of multiple datasets when plotting using Bokeh"},{"tags":["arrays","api","testing","automated-tests","postman"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6749,"user_id":6028443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dk5i2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Danny Dainton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6028443/danny-dainton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571434985,"post_id":58457584,"comment_id":103253920,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457584/how-to-store-array-values-in-an-environment-variable-in-postman#comment103253920_58457584"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":8015607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fb05e5a7e810041e2614516e08e5662?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sjain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8015607/sjain"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6749,"user_id":6028443,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dk5i2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Danny Dainton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6028443/danny-dainton"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571469922,"post_id":58457584,"comment_id":103258966,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457584/how-to-store-array-values-in-an-environment-variable-in-postman#comment103258966_58457584"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1543,"user_id":1416121,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/meEPF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"so cal cheesehead","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1416121/so-cal-cheesehead"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571763517,"creation_date":1571763517,"answer_id":58509085,"question_id":58457584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58509085","body_markdown":"When you retrieve a value from an environment variable like you&#39;re doing: \r\n\r\n    ClientArray = pm.environment.get(&quot;ClientArray&quot;);\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re not getting an array, you&#39;re getting a string which is why you&#39;re getting that error.

So my first question is it possibly to achieve my 2 goals without service workers? \r\n\r\nWhen I run this, with a debug angular server, (```ng serve hub-app --host=0.0.0.0 --prod```) I can get tot he site on my ipad pin it and launch it site, works just fine. (note I know pwa works over http on localhost only, but oddly when my ipad hits my dev machine it&#39;s not using a localhost address, and seems to work just fine. even when passing in the `--prod` flag) If install our product, and try to do the same thing, the site just sits and does nothing, it seems the angular run time is never starting up. but I noticed the angular scripts have a `defer` tag. \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;runtime.1055bb5ba2e788f506b9.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;polyfills.34c0c6140312ee9a4a8f.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;main.67d9d64f0328fe5849f5.js&quot; defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nif I remove those from the built version, hey my app loads. So my question is why are those ever running, I know they&#39;re supposed to run when the page is done loading, but I can&#39;t figure out why that even is never firing. So the other thing I am trying to confirm is this truly an HTTPS and server work issue? \r\n\r\nby default in my app.module I have the following commented out \r\n```// ServiceWorkerModule.register(&#39;ngsw-worker.js&#39;, { enabled: environment.production }),```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried setting `enabled: false` no change. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve hooked up the iPad to a macbook for debugging with safari, and no errors are being thrown to the console as far as I can tell. the index page loads just fine, and is what I would expect, but as I say it&#39;s like the `defer` scripts are never being ran. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457551/angular-ipados-pinnable-site-without-service-workers","title":"Angular iPadOS pinnable site without service workers?"},{"tags":["sabre","sws"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1415,"user_id":2862341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9b47330aa26f09e1756b4cd2df92af4d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ravindra HV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2862341/ravindra-hv"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571442497,"post_id":58457549,"comment_id":103255399,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457549/getreservationrq-v1-19-0-returns-not-well-formed-response#comment103255399_58457549"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12240482,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCiSm3MirksKfDJl5mxG7dIS5K8DORoCxi7pBnC8w=k-s128","display_name":"user12240482","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12240482/user12240482"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571444862,"creation_date":1571429346,"last_edit_date":1571444862,"question_id":58457549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457549","body_markdown":"`GetReservationRQ` v1.19.0\r\n\r\nWe&#39;re calling `GetReservationRQ` to get the PNR details, but looks like SWS side didn&#39;t convert some characters like &lt;, &gt; into &amp;lt; or &amp;gt; in the response, which causes the response is not well-formed xml, and we&#39;re not able to process the response.

Looking at the way Protractor `6` did it, I did it to Protractor `5.4.1`:\r\n\r\nI edited the file located at `node_modules/selenium-webdriver/lib/webdriver.js` and added the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Capability names that are defined in the W3C spec.\r\nconst W3C_CAPABILITY_NAMES = new Set([\r\n    &#39;acceptInsecureCerts&#39;,\r\n    &#39;browserName&#39;,\r\n    &#39;browserVersion&#39;,\r\n    &#39;platformName&#39;,\r\n    &#39;pageLoadStrategy&#39;,\r\n    &#39;proxy&#39;,\r\n    &#39;setWindowRect&#39;,\r\n    &#39;timeouts&#39;,\r\n    &#39;unhandledPromptBehavior&#39;,\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in the same file I modify the `static createSession(executor, capabilities, opt_flow, opt_onQuit)` method to add the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    let W3CCaps = new Capabilities(capabilities);\r\n    for (let k of W3CCaps.keys()) {\r\n      // Any key containing a colon is a vendor-prefixed capability.\r\n      if (!(W3C_CAPABILITY_NAMES.has(k) || k.indexOf(&#39;:&#39;) &gt;= 0)) {\r\n        W3CCaps.delete(k);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cmd.setParameter(&#39;capabilities&#39;, W3CCaps);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter all those changes the request getting to Selenoid is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n\t&quot;desiredCapabilities&quot;: {\r\n\t\t&quot;browserName&quot;: &quot;MicrosoftEdge&quot;,\r\n\t\t&quot;version&quot;: &quot;18.0&quot;,\r\n\t\t&quot;enableVNC&quot;: true,\r\n\t\t&quot;enableVideo&quot;: false,\r\n\t\t&quot;count&quot;: 1\r\n\t},\r\n\t&quot;capabilities&quot;: {\r\n\t\t&quot;browserName&quot;: &quot;MicrosoftEdge&quot;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my Protractor 5 config looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  multiCapabilities: [{\r\n    browserName: &#39;MicrosoftEdge&#39;,\r\n    version: &#39;18.0&#39;,\r\n    enableVNC: true,\r\n    enableVideo: false\r\n  }]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\n\r\nSo that I don&#39;t have to worry about refresh installs or updates I use the package `patch-package` (https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) to create a patch that is applied when any of those events happen. Here is a great video explaining how to use that package https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBPcVGr6XPk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457533/protractor-w3c-capability/58492544#58492544","title":"Protractor W3C capability"}],"owner":{"reputation":466,"user_id":280914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iw5e3.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Emil Orol","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/280914/emil-orol"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58492544,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571848338,"creation_date":1571429274,"question_id":58457533,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457533","body_markdown":"I am using `Protractor` with `Selenoid`.

Here&#39;s what I came up with:\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve got the following directory structure:\r\n\r\n[![][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using text files instead of wav files in my example, because I don&#39;t have any wav files on hand.\r\nIn my `root`, I have `A` and `B` (these are supposed to be your &quot;labeled directories&quot;). `A` has two text files. `B` has one immediate text file and one subfolder with another text file inside (this is meant to simulate your &quot;irrelevant multiple directories&quot;).\r\n\r\nThe code:\r\n\r\n\r\n    def main():\r\n    \r\n        from pathlib import Path\r\n    \r\n        root_path = Path(&quot;./root/&quot;)\r\n        labeled_directories = [path for path in root_path.iterdir() if path.is_dir()]\r\n    \r\n        txt_path_lists = []\r\n    \r\n        # Generate lists of txt paths\r\n        for labeled_directory in labeled_directories:\r\n            txt_path_list = list(labeled_directory.glob(&quot;**/*.txt&quot;))\r\n            txt_path_lists.append(txt_path_list)\r\n    \r\n        # Print the lists of txt paths\r\n        for txt_path_list in txt_path_lists:\r\n            print(txt_path_list)\r\n    \r\n        return 0\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        import sys\r\n        sys.exit(main())\r\n\r\nThe output:\r\n\r\n    [WindowsPath(&#39;root/A/a_one.txt&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;root/A/a_two.txt&#39;)]\r\n    [WindowsPath(&#39;root/B/b_one.txt&#39;), WindowsPath(&#39;root/B/asdasdasd/b_two.txt&#39;)]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, we generated two lists of text file paths, one for each labeled directory. The glob pattern I used (`**/*.txt`) handles multiple nested directories, and recursively finds all text files. All you have to do is change the extension in the glob pattern to have it find .wav files instead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/EhuX8.png\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457530/is-there-a-way-to-automatically-generate-an-empty-array-for-each-iteration-of-a/58457844#58457844","title":"Is there a way to automatically generate an empty array for each iteration of a for loop?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":8225766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b2985b1a75732aab584e3020ae653c2e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DIB98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8225766/dib98"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571430911,"creation_date":1571429249,"question_id":58457530,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457530","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a separate array for each pass of the for loop in order to store the values of &#39;signal&#39; which are generated by the wavefile.read function. \r\n\r\nSome background as to how the code works / how Id like it to work:\r\n\r\nI have the following file path: \r\n\r\n    Root directory \r\n        Labeled directory\r\n            Irrelevant multiple directories\r\n                Multiple .wav files stored in these subdirectories\r\n\r\n        Labeled directory\r\n            Irrelevant multiple directories\r\n                Multiple .wav files stored in these subdirectories\r\n\r\nNow for each Labeled Folder, Id like to create an array that holds the values of all the .wav files contained in its respective sub directories.\r\n\r\nThis is what I attempted: \r\n\r\n    for label in df.index:\r\n  \r\n        for path, directories, files in os.walk(&#39;voxceleb1/wav_dev_files/&#39; + label):\r\n            for file in files:\r\n                if file.endswith(&#39;.wav&#39;):\r\n                    count = count + 1\r\n                    rate,signal = wavfile.read(os.path.join(path, file))\r\n                \r\n    print(count)\r\n\r\n\r\n[![What dataframe df looks like][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAbove is a snapshot of dataframe df \r\n\r\nUltimately, the reason for these arrays is that I would like to calculate the mean average length of time of the wav files contained in each labeled subdirectory and add this as a column vector to the dataframe.\r\n\r\nNote that the index of the dataframe corresponds to the directory names.

You can do this by setting up the `multi sub` first, and then passing the `proto` as the parameter:\r\n\r\n    proto sub store(|) {*}\r\n    multi sub store(\\self, Int) { say &quot;Int&quot; }\r\n    multi sub store(\\self, Str) { say &quot;Str&quot; }\r\n\r\n    my $a := Proxy.new(\r\n      FETCH =&gt; -&gt; $ { 42 },\r\n      STORE =&gt; &amp;store,\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    say $a;     # 42\r\n    $a = 42;    # Int\r\n    $a = &quot;foo&quot;; # Str\r\n\r\nAnd if you want to make the code shorter, but possibly less understandable, you can get rid of the `proto` (because it will be auto-generated for you) and the `sub` in the `multi` (because you can):\r\n\r\n    multi store(\\self, Int) { say &quot;Int&quot; }\r\n    multi store(\\self, Str) { say &quot;Str&quot; }\r\n\r\n    my $a := Proxy.new(\r\n      FETCH =&gt; -&gt; $ { 42 },\r\n      STORE =&gt; &amp;store,\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    say $a;     # 42\r\n    $a = 42;    # Int\r\n    $a = &quot;foo&quot;; # Str","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457529/multimethod-for-proxy/58462723#58462723","title":"Multimethod for Proxy"}],"owner":{"reputation":845,"user_id":3646587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb1e27fe3d6e271ac02a47709e042d7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user0721090601","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3646587/user0721090601"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8810,"user_id":891440,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd366bcdcf85991fa8af1b6d11d3ad49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jjmerelo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/891440/jjmerelo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"accepted_answer_id":58462723,"answer_count":1,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571480808,"creation_date":1571429244,"last_edit_date":1571431571,"question_id":58457529,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457529","body_markdown":"Is it possible to use multidispatch for the store method when using a Proxy?

Coming from a RDBMS background, polymorphic relationships are a **red flag**. That doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re always a bad design (that would be too easy), but they&#39;re inherently problematic. Mainly, because a lot of the relational integrity controls you can get declaratively, and for &quot;free&quot; in an RDBMS are thrown out. Then again, polymorphic relations tend to come up in cases where the relational model is an awkward fit. (Kind of relations.) I use such relations from time to time, but rarely....and with a lot of thought in advance.  I guess that promiscuous relations are baked into Laravel, so Laravel may have overcome a lot of the problems for you already somehow. (As noted, I haven&#39;t a clue.) And if Postgres is just a persistance mechanism for Laravel, maybe it doesn&#39;t matter so much.\r\n\r\nYou didn&#39;t ask about polymorphic relations per se, so I&#39;ll leave it at that.

Not sure which one you&#39;re wondering about, so I guess I&#39;ll answer all three.\r\n\r\n* How did you get away with declaring `int main(i)` without a type for `i`?\r\n\r\n* How did you get away with declaring `main` as accepting one parameter, not the conventional two?\r\n\r\n* Where did the value 1 come from when you ran it?\r\n\r\nAnswers:\r\n\r\n(1) Once upon a time, a rather long time ago by now, in what pretty much counts as the dawn (or at least the morning) of C, the function definition syntax was different.  You didn&#39;t say things like\r\n\r\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nInstead, you said\r\n\r\n    int main(argc, argv)\r\n    int argc;\r\n    char *argv[];\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd that was when &quot;implicit `int`&quot; was all the rage, too.  So if you just wrote\r\n\r\n    int main(argc, argv)\r\n    char *argv[];\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthe compiler said &quot;Okay, there&#39;s a parameter `argv` and it&#39;s a `char **`, and there&#39;s a parameter `argc` and it&#39;s a... oh, you didn&#39;t say, so I&#39;ll just quietly assume `int`.&quot;\r\n\r\nAnd since C has always been pretty big on backwards compatibility, many compilers are still accepting the older syntax today, even though it&#39;s been officially obsolete for a while now.\r\n\r\n(2) Also, in your case you completely left off the `argv` part.  `main` is supposed to have two arguments, that&#39;s the way the system is calling it when your program starts up, but you only declared it as accepting one.  So why did it work?\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking the behavior is undefined when a function gets called with a different number of arguments than it expects, but it&#39;s the kind of thing you can often get away with, especially in the case that there were more arguments passed than expected.  So although the system passed a second, `argv` argument that your program didn&#39;t expect, the extra argument was just quietly discarded.\r\n\r\n(3) And then, where did the 1 come from?  Well, that&#39;s due to what `main`&#39;s conventional `argc` and `argv` arguments actually mean.  C&#39;s `main` definition is based on the command-line invocation.  Normally people type things like\r\n\r\n    programname somefilename someotherargument\r\n\r\nand then hit RETURN.  This invokes a program named `programname`, with two command-line arguments `somefilename` and `someotherargument`.  So how are those passed in to `main`?\r\n\r\nWell, `argc` is a count of how many of them there were, and `argv` is an array (v is for &quot;vector&quot;) of the argument strings themselves.

You can specify the locale to be used by default as a parameter when NetBeans is started:\r\n\r\n   `--locale &lt;language[:country[:variant]]&gt;`\r\n\r\n  For example: `--locale en:US` for American English, and `--locale fr:FR` for French. \r\n  \r\n  This setting will apply for the current NetBeans session only.\r\n \r\n2. You can permanently set the default locale used by NetBeans, by specifying it in the file **etc/netbeans.conf** within your NetBeans installation directory:\r\n  - Open that file in any text editor.\r\n  - Locate the line containing the text **netbeans_default_options**\r\n  - Add the values to specify the language and country of the locale. for example, to set the locale to US English:\r\n   `-J-Duser.language=en -J-Duser.country=US`\r\n  - See the article [Change UI language to English on Netbeans IDE][2] for more details.\r\n\r\n3. You can dynamically specify the `Locale` to be used at the application level within the code. For example, in your case you could set the locale used by your application&#39;s `Scanner` by calling `useLocale()`.\r\n\r\nYour code code might look like this:\r\n\r\n    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    scanner.useLocale(Locale.US); // US locale, so period is expected for numeric input.\r\n    ...\r\n    scanner.useLocale(Locale.FR); // France locale, so comma is expected for numeric input.\r\n\r\nAll three approaches can resolve your problem, and you can use any or all of them. Your specific needs determine the one(s) to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Locale.html\r\n  [2]: https://pkolomeitsev.blogspot.com/2016/12/change-ui-language-to-english-on.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457466/netbeans-using-comma-as-default-why/58498780#58498780","title":"Netbeans using comma as default.

I have a JavaScript application where I&#39;m appending the hashes to the filenames, as is the standard for Webpack output. This way the content can be safely cached by the browser, with the fresh load controlled by the changing file hash.\r\n\r\nMy problem is I have a situation where I need other applications to access mine, and they won&#39;t be able to be updated every time the hash changes. So I need a request like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://my-domain.com/assets/js/app.js\r\n\r\nto be redirected to\r\n\r\nhttps://my-domain.com/assets/js/app.ab12cd34.js\r\n\r\nMy application currently uses nginx to serve up the pages, but nginx is static. I don&#39;t know how to configure it to dynamically identify the hashed file name and return it.\r\n\r\nThe app is being deployed to a Pivotal CloudFoundry environment. PCF supports evaluating dynamic Ruby code in an nginx.conf file, so that seemed like an easy way around this. Unfortunately, my company requires that the nginx.conf go through a special parser to enforce security headers. This parser only knows nginx syntax, and mangles any Ruby code there.\r\n\r\nSo, that leaves me with Webpack. I started investigating ways for Webpack to modify files during the build process, and I discovered the transform() function in the copy-webpack-plugin. It has the ability to modify the files exactly how I need. What is still a challenge, though, is getting the hash filename.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#39;m hoping there&#39;s some way to gain access to what the hash filename will be in this plugin, so that I can inject it into the nginx.conf.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if someone knows another way to get around my core problem, I&#39;m all ears.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457441/how-to-access-webpack-generated-filenames-in-a-plugin","title":"How to access webpack generated filenames in a plugin?"},{"tags":["r","shiny","plotly"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":6669929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3ddd5d84d848c8f6cae2ff80997cde4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NewUser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6669929/newuser"},"last_editor":{"reputation":156,"user_id":6669929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3ddd5d84d848c8f6cae2ff80997cde4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NewUser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6669929/newuser"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571591093,"last_edit_date":1571591093,"creation_date":1571590749,"answer_id":58475272,"question_id":58457439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58475272","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve managed to solve the x-axis mismatch, however this didn&#39;t solve the autosize issue.

Constant means that you can say at compile time what the value of the property will be and that it won&#39;t be able to change at runtime.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457397/set-table-attribute-dynamically/58457434#58457434","title":"Set Table Attribute Dynamically"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":8877836,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nmPOw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheShield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8877836/theshield"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571428921,"post_id":58457435,"comment_id":103251965,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457397/set-table-attribute-dynamically/58457435#comment103251965_58457435"},{"owner":{"reputation":2583,"user_id":1344058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3415294e59071c4e6d06c7cb9d21e3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"germi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1344058/germi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":99,"user_id":8877836,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nmPOw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheShield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8877836/theshield"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571429071,"post_id":58457435,"comment_id":103252036,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457397/set-table-attribute-dynamically/58457435#comment103252036_58457435"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2583,"user_id":1344058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3415294e59071c4e6d06c7cb9d21e3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"germi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1344058/germi"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571428816,"creation_date":1571428816,"answer_id":58457435,"question_id":58457397,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58457435","body_markdown":"As the error says, you must use either a `constant`, a `typeof` expression or an array creation.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution would be:\r\n\r\n    public class LSODatabase\r\n    {\r\n        public const string databaseString = &quot;myDatabase&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you can use that as an argument for your attribute.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457397/set-table-attribute-dynamically/58457435#58457435","title":"Set Table Attribute Dynamically"}],"owner":{"reputation":99,"user_id":8877836,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nmPOw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheShield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8877836/theshield"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571491787,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571428816,"creation_date":1571428607,"question_id":58457397,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58457397","body_markdown":"I am trying to set the `TableAttribute` for my view like so:\r\n```\r\n[Table(LSODatabase.databaseString)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever the following error is thrown:\r\n```\r\nAn attribute argument must be a constant expression, typeof expression or array creation expression of an attribute parameter type.\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround I am trying to avoid is making another view and manually setting the strings, however I have a lot of views and would like to avoid this as much as possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457397/set-table-attribute-dynamically","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Set Table Attribute Dynamically"},{"tags":["user-agent"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9357,"user_id":90580,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2bc85f56e32b0c01f0acc44f509ecd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ecerulm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/90580/ecerulm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571428605,"creation_date":1571428605,"answer_id":58457396,"question_id":58457395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58457396","body_markdown":"The part `GmmClient:google_ios/com.google.Maps/5.27.8/Mobile/ios` probably indicates that traffic is generated from  Google Maps for iOS, when THe website is opened in a webview inside this app. \r\n\r\nBut I can&#39;t find any documentation referencing `GmmClient` so I can&#39;t confirm it.

Essentially I want to add new routes and be able to click on say like a button, and that will take me to the desired route that I want to go to.\r\n\r\nThe way it is set up in our application is that you actually have to manually go in the browser and type in the extended path to access that route, which doesn&#39;t seem like a good way of doing it.\r\n\r\nRight now I have a route set up for our inventory system.  You would access this route by typing in *localhost::3000/inventory*.  There are buttons that come up on this main page which when clicked render that specific component.  Instead of doing it that way, I would rather set up another route like */additem* to the inventory path so that when I click on the *Add Item* button it will take me to the path *localhost::3000/inventory/additem* and render that component.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what our index.js file looks like for reference\r\n```javascript\r\nimport &quot;babel-polyfill&quot;;\r\nimport &#39;core-js/es6/map&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;core-js/es6/set&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;core-js/fn/array/find&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;core-js/fn/array/includes&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;core-js/fn/number/is-nan&#39;;\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport ReactDOM from &#39;react-dom&#39;;\r\nimport &#39;./index.css&#39;;\r\nimport App from &#39;./App&#39;;\r\n\r\nimport ServiceReport from &#39;./imports/ServiceReportUI/ServiceReport&#39;\r\nimport &#39;./StyleSheets/ServiceReport.css&#39;;\r\nimport InventorySystem from &#39;./imports/InventorySystem/InventorySystem.js&#39;;\r\nimport AddNewItemBtn from &quot;./imports/InventorySystem/AddNewItemBtn&quot;;\r\nimport { BrowserRouter, Route, Link, Switch } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39; \r\n\r\nReactDOM.render((\r\n    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n        &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route exact path=&#39;/&#39; component={App}/&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route path=&#39;/service&#39; component={ServiceReport} /&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route exact path=&#39;/inventory&#39; component={InventorySystem} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;), document.getElementById(&#39;appRoot&#39;));\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m thinking that adding another route like so will do the trick:\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;Route exact path=&#39;/inventory/additem&#39; component={AddItem} /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I would access that route from within my InventorySystem.js file by doing something like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nClass InventorySystem extends React.Component{\r\n constructor(props){\r\n  super(props);\r\n  this.state = {}\r\n }\r\n\r\n goTo(e){\r\n  //go to Add Item path\r\n }\r\n\r\n render(){\r\n  return(\r\n  &lt;button onClick={this.goTo.bind(this)}&gt;Add Item&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n  )\r\n\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know much about React Router, and I&#39;m also not sure if this is the right way of going about this, but any help or suggestions would be awesome!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58457392/how-do-i-navigate-to-a-different-route-in-my-react-application","title":"How do I navigate to a different route in my react application?"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":9281}
