Regardless of the fact that you use separate technology for your database or the same on different server you perform an operation which is transactional.\r\nIn order to handle a rollback on that type of transaction you can not relay on the database technology mechanism for transactions and rollbacks. You have to do it on your own.\r\n\r\n**Saga Pattern**\r\n\r\nCommon solution for distributed transaction scenarios in micro-service architecture is the [Saga pattern][1].\r\nDistributed sagas is a pattern for managing failures in scenarios as the one that you have described.\r\n\r\nSaga are created based on business process for example &quot;Buy a Product in online shop&quot;. This process can involve multiple actions on multiple micro-services. Saga will control and manage this process execution and if one of the steps fail it will trigger actions to revert the actions done before the failing action.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple ways to implement sagas. It depends on your architecture and the way your micro-services communicate with each other. Do you use Commands and/or Events? \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n&quot;Buy a Product in online shop&quot; business process. Lets say this business process has 3 simple steps done by 3 different micro-services:\r\n\r\n - Action 1 - Reserve Product in products-inventory-micro-service \r\n - Action 2 - Validate payment in payment-micro-service\r\n - Action 3 - Order a product in orders-micro-service\r\n\r\n**Using Events:**\r\n\r\nYou can publish events to perform some action(or actions) and if one of the action fails you can publish a revert(or delete) event for that event. For the above business process lets say the 1. Action succeeded and the 2. Action failed. In this case in order to rollback the 1. Action you would publish an event like &quot;RemoveReservationFromProduct&quot; in order to remove the reservation and revert the state back to the state as it was before the transaction for that Business process started. This event would be picked up by a event handler which would go and revert that state in your database. Since it is an event you can implement retry mechanism for failures or just reapply it later if there is some bug in the code.\r\n\r\n**Using commands:**\r\n\r\nIf you have direct calls to your micro-services as commands using some kind of rest api you could run some delete or update endpoints to revert the changes that you have done. For the above business process lets say the 1. Action succeeded and the 2. Action failed. In this case in order to rollback the 1. Action you would call the delete api to delete the reservation for a particular product in order to remove the reservation and revert the state back to the state as it was before the transaction for that Business process started. \r\n\r\nYou can take a look at [this][2] example how to implement the Saga pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html\r\n  [2]: https://blog.bernd-ruecker.com/saga-how-to-implement-complex-business-transactions-without-two-phase-commit-e00aa41a1b1b","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178511/how-to-rollback-microservices/58186038#58186038","title":"How to rollback MicroServices"}],"owner":{"reputation":904,"user_id":2931744,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/798177393fa8b91cf44c01fb22d03186?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2931744/sat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58186038,"answer_count":4,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570030107,"creation_date":1569907501,"question_id":58178511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178511","body_markdown":"I have doubt related to MicroServices.

I know that a multi-threaded OS must store thread execution context and provide mechanisms to schedule and dispatch KLTs, and that kernel level threads handle interrupts, system calls, and provide an interface to the CPU as a resource at the user-kernel interface. I am not clear on what services are necessary to support KLTs in a multi-threaded OS.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI cannot determine if there is a core kernel process that is necessary to support all KLTs, or if KLTs run interdependently as the base-level of computing. I would like to understand what minimum set of operations (resource allocation, scheduling) is necessary to support an OS with KLTs. \r\n\r\nI have looked at Tanenbaums [Tanenbaum&#39;s discussion of threads in his distributed systems book][2], [Understanding the Linux Kernel][3], and [MultiThreading the SunOS kernel][4] but I cannot find an answer to my question.\r\n\r\nI believe that answering the question -- What Operating System services are necessary to support kernel-level threads? -- will help me understand how KLTs are implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Switch to prepared statements. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, PHP 5.6 is not supported anymore, and you should consider upgrading as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nA sample prepared statement using PDO could look like this:\r\n\r\n    $dsn = &quot;mysql:host=$host;dbname=$db;charset=utf8mb4&quot;;\r\n    $options = [\r\n    \t\\PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE =&gt; \\PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION,\r\n    \t\\PDO::ATTR_EMULATE_PREPARES =&gt; false,\r\n    ];\r\n    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $user, $pass, $options);\r\n\r\n    $stmt = $pdo-&gt;prepare(&#39;select transaction_id from tbl_sales_revenue WHERE id=? limit 1&#39;);\r\n    $stmt-&gt;execute([$_POST[&#39;id&#39;]]);\r\n    $record = $stmt-&gt;fetch();\r\n\r\nOr using mysqli:\r\n\r\n\tmysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);\r\n\t$mysqli = new mysqli($host, $user, $pass, $db);\r\n\t$mysqli-&gt;set_charset(&#39;utf8mb4&#39;);\r\n\r\n\t$stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare(&#39;select transaction_id from tbl_sales_revenue WHERE id=? limit 1&#39;);\r\n\t$stmt-&gt;bind_param(&#39;s&#39;, $_POST[&#39;id&#39;]);\r\n\t$stmt-&gt;execute();\r\n\t$record = $stmt-&gt;get_result()-&gt;fetch_assoc();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178477/does-php-5-6-support-prepared-statement/58181071#58181071","title":"Does php 5.6 support prepared statement?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12146556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-haPtJ0RBcvQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re7WzoxjYEiJd2xVLt2FLouUFvlqQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jashandeep Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12146556/jashandeep-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58181071,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569919960,"creation_date":1569907259,"last_edit_date":1569919960,"question_id":58178477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178477","body_markdown":"Does php 5.6 support prepared statement ?

my web app I want to give users the ability to author their own modules for use in the app. These are ideally written in JS on the client side.\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;m having trouble allowing for classes created on the client side to be accessed by the app. Originally I wanted some kind of module import, but dynamic imports still require a path, which isn&#39;t accessible by the browser for security reasons. Just doing a straight import of the JS into a script tag pollutes the global namespace, which isn&#39;t ideal either.\r\n\r\nIs there some sensible way to do this? I would ideally want to import the class, e.g.\r\n\r\n    // MyClass.js, on the client side\r\n    export default class MyClass {\r\n        myPrint() {\r\n            console.log(&#39;ya blew it&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then in App.js:\r\n\r\n    import(somehow_get_this_path).then((MyClass) =&gt; { etc});\r\n\r\nIs getting that path possible? The current namespace-polluting method uses a select file dialog but doesn&#39;t allow me to tell import what path it has. All you get is a blob.

I have code that will fill in the search box but nothing happens.  \r\n\r\n```vb\r\nSub GetMotherboards()\r\n    Dim ie                      As InternetExplorer\r\n    Set ie = New InternetExplorer\r\n\r\n    Dim doc                     As HTMLDocument\r\n    Dim objText                 As DataObject\r\n    Dim objArticleContents      As Object\r\n    Dim objLinksCollection      As Object\r\n    Dim objToClipBoard          As DataObject\r\n    Dim r As Object\r\n    Dim prodRating              As String\r\n    Dim prodName                As String\r\n    Dim lngNumberOfVideos As Long\r\n    Dim strURL                  As String\r\n    Dim strNewString As String, strStr As String, strTestChar As String\r\n    Dim bFlag As Boolean\r\n\r\n    strURL = &quot;https://pcpartpicker.com/products/motherboard/&quot; &#39; Range(&quot;J5&quot;).Value\r\n    With ie\r\n        .navigate strURL\r\n        .Visible = True\r\n        Do While .readyState &lt;&gt; 4: DoEvents: Loop\r\n        Application.Wait Now + #12:00:02 AM#\r\n       \r\n        Set doc = ie.document\r\n    End With\r\n    bFlag = False\r\n    With doc\r\n        Set objArticleContents = .getElementsByClassName(&quot;subTitle__form&quot;)\r\n\r\n        Stop\r\n        Set ele = .getElementsByClassName(&quot;subTitle__form&quot;)(0)\r\n\r\n        Set form = .getElementsByClassName(&quot;subTitle__form&quot;)(0).getElementsByClassName(&quot;form-label xs-inline&quot;)(1)\r\n\r\n        Set inzputz = ele.getElementsByClassName(&quot;text-input&quot;)(0)\r\n        Call .getElementsByClassName(&quot;text-input&quot;)(0).setAttribute(&quot;placeholder&quot;, &quot;MSI B450 TOMAHAWK&quot;) &#39;.setAttribute(&quot;part_category_search&quot;, &quot;MSI B450 TOMAHAWK&quot;)\r\n    End With\r\n\r\nEnd Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter reading some posts here (which I now can&#39;t find) my thinking is that there is/ are event listeners and functions that need to be included in this code but that is over my head.

server is giving you the Response in such a way that the `userId` is a `string`. The values that are **String** are enclosed inside of double quotes ie. (&quot;&quot;). \r\n\r\nNow if you want to get `double` value for `userId` in your server response, you will have to change the backend code written in php or something else.\r\n\r\nBut you can easily make a POJO class for your Response like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Response\r\n{\r\n    private String UserName;\r\n\r\n    private String SiteCode;\r\n\r\n    private String UserId;\r\n\r\n

UserId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setUserId (String UserId)\r\n    {\r\n        this.UserId = UserId;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getEmployeecode ()\r\n    {\r\n        return

      return IsActive;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setIsActive (String IsActive)\r\n    {\r\n        this.IsActive = IsActive;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getFullName ()\r\n    {\r\n        return FullName;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void setFullName (String FullName)\r\n    {\r\n        this.FullName = FullName;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public String getProfileURL ()\r\n    {\r\n

   {\r\n        return &quot;Response [UserName = &quot;+UserName+&quot;, SiteCode = &quot;+SiteCode+&quot;, UserId = &quot;+UserId+&quot;, Employeecode = &quot;+Employeecode+&quot;, IsActive = &quot;+IsActive+&quot;, FullName = &quot;+FullName+&quot;, ProfileURL = &quot;+ProfileURL+&quot;]&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand whenever you need `userId` as double, you can do `double num = Double.parseDouble(StringValue);`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178433/getting-wrong-data-type-from-retrofit-response/58178538#58178538","title":"getting wrong data type from retrofit

To keep it short, it&#39;s a library for interacting with a specific piece of hardware. What I have is .a and .dll library files, for linux and windows respectively, and a bunch of C++ .h headers with all the public functions and classes described there.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the project needs to be in Java, so I need to write a JNI wrapper for this library, and honestly, I&#39;ve never done that. But that&#39;s ok, I&#39;m down to learn the thing.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read up a bunch of documentation online, and I figured out passing variables, creating java objects from native code, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat I can&#39;t figure out, is how to work with native constructors using JNI? I have no idea what the source code of these constructors are, I only have the headers like this:\r\n\r\n    namespace RFDevice {\r\n\r\n\tclass RFDEVICE_API RFEthernetDetector\r\n\t{\r\n\tpublic:\r\n\t\t//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\t//  FUNCTION  RFEthernetDetector::RFEthernetDetector\r\n\t\t/// \\brief    Default constructor of RFEthernetDetector object.\r\n\t\t///           \r\n\t\t/// \\return   void : N/A\r\n\t\t//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\t\tRFEthernetDetector();\r\n\t\tRFEthernetDetector(const WORD wCustomPortNumber);\r\n\r\nSo basically if I was to write my program in C++ (which I can&#39;t), I would do something like\r\n\r\n    RFEthernetDetector ethernetDetector = new RFEthernerDetector(somePort);\r\nand then work with that object. But... How do I do this in Java using JNI?\r\nI don&#39;t understand how am I supposed to create a native method for constructor, that would call the constructor from my .a library, and then have some way of working with that specific object? I know how to create java objects from native code - but the thing is I don&#39;t have any information about internal structure of the RFEthernetDetector class - only some of it&#39;s public fields and public methods.\r\n\r\nAnd I can&#39;t seem to find the right articles on the net to help me out. How do I do that?\r\n\r\nUpdate: A bit further clarification.\r\n\r\nI create a .java wrapper class like this:\r\n\r\n    public class RFEthernetDetector\r\n    {\r\n        public RFEthernetDetector(int portNumber)\r\n        {\r\n            Init(portNumber);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public native void Init(int portNumber);            // Void? Or what?\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthen I compile it with -h parameter to generate JNI .h file:\r\n\r\n    /* DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE - it is machine generated */\r\n    #include &lt;jni.h&gt;\r\n    /* Header for class RFEthernetDetector */\r\n    \r\n    #ifndef _Included_RFEthernetDetector\r\n    #define _Included_RFEthernetDetector\r\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\r\n    extern &quot;C&quot; {\r\n    #endif\r\n    /*\r\n     * Class:     RFEthernetDetector\r\n     * Method:    Init\r\n     * Signature: (I)V\r\n     */\r\n    JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_RFEthernetDetector_Init\r\n      (JNIEnv *, jobject, jint);\r\n    \r\n    #ifdef __cplusplus\r\n    }\r\n    #endif\r\n    #endif\r\n\r\n\r\nI then create an implementation that will call the functions from my .a library:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;RFEthernetDetector.h&quot;\t\t// auto-generated JNI header\r\n    #include &quot;RFEthernetDetector_native.h&quot;\t// h file that comes with the library, \r\n    \t\t\t\t\t//contains definition of RFEthernetDetector class\r\n    /*\r\n     * Class:     RFEthernetDetector\r\n     * Method:    Init\r\n     * Signature: (I)V\r\n     */\r\n    JNIEXPORT void JNICALL Java_RFEthernetDetector_Init(JNIEnv *env, jobject thisObj, jint value)\r\n    {\r\n    \tRFEthernetDetector *rfeDetector = new RFEthernetDetector(value);\t// constructor from the library\r\n    \t// now how do I access this new object from Java?\r\n    \t// if I need to later call rfDetector-&gt;doSomething() on that exact class instance?\r\n

This is important, because if you have a 1:1 join, you can remove a record from the state as soon as it was joined with another record and you don&#39;t need to keep it around for the full year. Hence, your state only stores records that were not joined yet. Assuming that the majority of records is quickly joined, your state might remain reasonable small.\r\n\r\nIf you have a 1:1 join, the time-window joins of Flink&#39;s Table API (and SQL) and the Interval join of the DataStream API are *not* what you want. They are implemented as m:n joins because every record might join with more than one record of the other input. Hence they keep *all* records for the full window interval, i.e., for one year in your use case. If you have a 1:1 join, you should implement the join yourself as a `KeyedCoProcessFunction`.\r\n\r\nIf every record can join multiple times within one year, there&#39;s no way around buffering these records. In this case, you can use the time-window joins of Flink&#39;s Table API (and SQL) and the Interval join of the DataStream API.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178404/stream-joins-for-large-time-windows-with-flink/58180778#58180778","title":"Stream Joins for Large Time Windows with Flink"}],"owner":{"reputation":135,"user_id":5803998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7417df1793af6f952964b7f22896c7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abhishek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5803998/abhishek"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58180778,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569919455,"creation_date":1569906829,"question_id":58178404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178404","body_markdown":"I need to join two event sources based on a key.

But anyway, here it goes:\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou have three &quot;sub-questions&quot;:\r\n\r\n&gt; How to create `a.out` in another directory?\r\n\r\nThe target directory has to exist. Then you use the option `-o` on the compile and link command:\r\n\r\n    gcc -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage 1.c -o /home/user/john/a.out\r\n\r\nYou can even change the name of the executable if you like. This is quite common. ;-)\r\n\r\n&gt; How to create `1.gcno` in another directory?\r\n\r\nThis file needs to be moved because it is generated aside the source file. On un*x (linux) you commonly use:\r\n\r\n    mv 1.gcno /home/user/john\r\n\r\nMake sure that the target directory exists before.\r\n\r\n&gt; How to create `1.gcda` in another directory?\r\n\r\nStraight from the manual:\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, if the object file /user/build/foo.o was built with -fprofile-arcs, the final executable will try to create the data file /user/build/foo.gcda when running on the target system. This will fail if the corresponding directory does not exist and it is unable to create it. This can be overcome by, for example, setting the environment as ‘GCOV_PREFIX=/target/run’ and ‘GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=1’. Such a setting will name the data file /target/run/build/foo.gcda.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume that the build directory is `/home/user/jane/test`. The GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP variable will remove as many directories from the build path as given. We need 4: &quot;home&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;jane&quot;, and &quot;test&quot;. The GCOV_PREFIX variable will then put the given path in front of the remaining:\r\n\r\n    GCOV_PREFIX=/home/user/john GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP=4 /home/user/john/a.out\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow, if you try to generated the annotated source file `1.c.gcov` you will find that it will be created aside of `1.c`. You need to move this file to your target directory, too, like the .gcno file. Please read the documentation of `gcov` for more options. Unfortunately there seems to be no option to relocate the output and `gcov` seems to not use GCOV_PREFIX and GCOV_PREFIX_STRIP.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178396/how-to-move-gcno-files-and-how-to-move-gcda-files-by-using-gcov-prefix/58179069#58179069","title":"How to move gcno files and

This makes things much more simple for the actual execution or *output* section of the [`$let`][3].\r\n\r\n&gt; **Note**: An alternate approach to using [`$arrayElemAt`][7] against each key within the [`$map`][1] might well be to use [`$zip`][8] and [`$arrayToObject`][9]:\r\n\r\n&gt;             \r\n       &quot;in&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;$arrayToObject&quot;: { &quot;$zip&quot;: { &quot;inputs&quot;: [ [&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;], &quot;$$this&quot; ] } }\r\n       }\r\n\r\n&gt; It has the same principle in the overall output, but takes advantage of [`$zip`][8] producing &quot;paired&quot; arrays, which also happens to be valid input for [`$arrayToObject`][9] to produce the final *object* form.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the final part, we now basically have an *array of objects* with the named keys `x` and `y`. MongoDB allows a convenient way to *remap* simply the values for those named keys with notation like `&quot;$$m.x&quot;` where the `&quot;$$m` expression related to the named variable of the [`$let`][3] and is our *array of objects*, and the `.x` part of course simply means ***only the values of `x`***. This is a basic shorthand for a [`$map`][1] statement in itself, which suits this special usage case.\r\n\r\nThese arrays of values for specific properties can now be applied to the [`$min`][4] and [`$max`][5] operators, and this is how you get you `min` and `max` coordinates for a bounding rectangle.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Note that *inline operators* for arrays should always be preferred to [`$unwind`][10].**\r\n\r\nThe [`$unwind`][10] aggregation pipeline stage was an old introductory way of dealing with array elements by essentially *flattening* them into separate documents.\r\n\r\nThough necessary when you actually want to *group* on a value as a key that comes from within an array, most operations which don&#39;t actually need that ( like this one ) can be done with more modern approaches.\r\n\r\nThe usage of [`$unwind`][10] is actually a **huge** performance penalty, due to it&#39;s function essentially being to replicate the entire parent document content of the field containing the array into it&#39;s own new document. Particularly in large datasets this has a very negative effect on performance, due to much increases I/O and memory usage.\r\n\r\nThe main lesson being, unless it&#39;s necessary to the operation being performed ( and here it is not ) then you should not be using [`$unwind`][10] in an aggregation pipeline. It might *look* easier to understand, but your code is actually hurting the system it&#39;s running on by including it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlternate Client Approach\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote also that if you don&#39;t actually need these results for any *further* aggregation processing, then it&#39;s probably a lot cleaner to code in the client as each document is processed.\r\n\r\nFor example, here&#39;s a plain JavaScript version for the shell:\r\n\r\n    db.collection.find().map(({ _id, coord }) =&gt;\r\n      (({ coordinates }) =&gt;\r\n        ({\r\n          _id,\r\n          coord,\r\n          ...(m =&gt; \r\n            ({\r\n              minX: Math.min(...m.map(({ x }) =&gt; x)),\r\n              minY: Math.min(...m.map(({ y }) =&gt; y)),\r\n              maxX: Math.max(...m.map(({ x }) =&gt; x)),\r\n              maxY: Math.max(...m.map(({ y }) =&gt; y))\r\n            })\r\n          )(\r\n            ((c) =&gt; c.reduce((o,e) =&gt; [ ...o, ...e ],[]).map(([x,y]) =&gt; ({ x, y })) )(coordinates)\r\n          )\r\n      })\r\n      )(coord)\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThat has exactly the same output and is not nearly as unwieldy as the BSON operator statements required for an aggregation pipeline.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/map/\r\n  [2]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/reduce/\r\n  [3]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/let/\r\n  [4]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/min/\r\n  [5]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/max/\r\n  [6]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/replaceRoot/\r\n  [7]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayElemAt/\r\n  [8]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/zip/\r\n  [9]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/arrayToObject/\r\n  [10]: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/unwind/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178388/mongodb-aggregate-function-nested-ob/58184011#58184011","title":"Mongodb - aggregate function nested ob"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":3474541,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/514255b3d1f3b5439aef66cc016b1ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3474541","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3474541/user3474541"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11137,"user_id":3641067,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fhMde.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bur&#230;quete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3641067/bur%c3%a6quete"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":85,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58178669,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570090349,"creation_date":1569906658,"last_edit_date":1569988417,"question_id":58178388,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178388","body_markdown":"We need to calculate the minimum bounding rectangle (MBR) on Geospatial data.\r\nIn oracle, we  have `SDO_AGGR_MBR` function, is there any similar function in MongoDB.\r\n\r\n\r\n    &quot;coord&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;type&quot; : &quot;Polygon&quot;,\r\n        &quot;coordinates&quot; : [ \r\n            [ \r\n                [ \r\n                    25.5377574375611, \r\n                    42.8545750237221\r\n                ], \r\n                [ \r\n                    47.7803203666229, \r\n                    42.8545750237221\r\n                ], \r\n                [ \r\n                    47.7803203661319, \r\n                    52.0987759993153\r\n                ], \r\n                [ \r\n                    25.5377574370701, \r\n                    52.0987759993153\r\n                ], \r\n                [ \r\n                    25.5377574375611, \r\n                    42.8545750237221\r\n                ]\r\n            ]\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe have the geometry data like above but the coordinates length may vary.

Only thing I can do is introducing interfaces for project C. So is there a way to solve my problem with these cases? If there isn&#39;t what is the way to have such an one? And please note that these A,B,C projects are individual projects so those can&#39;t combine as one.

would just like to know why all commands in &#39;MenuItem` fire when only one is selected\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s because your implementation of `MultiCommandConverter` is flawed:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic object Convert( object[ ] value, Type targetType,\r\n    object parameter, CultureInfo culture )\r\n{\r\n    _value.AddRange( value );\r\n    return new RelayCommand( GetCompoundExecute( ), GetCompoundCanExecute( ) );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery time the converter object is asked to convert the input bindings to a new `ICommand` object, it will add the multiple values passed to it to its internal list of commands and then return a new `RelayCommand()` object that simply calls delegates that refer to those commands. I.e. because the delegate instances returned by `GetCompoundExecute()` and `GetCompoundCanExecute()` capture the `_value` field, changes that occur later to the list referred to by that field are reflected in delegates that were created earlier.\r\n\r\nThen, you create this converter as a resource, without specifying `x:Shared=false`. This means every place you used the converter is using the same object. So by the time all of the XAML is parsed, you have one converter that combines all of the commands used for all places where you&#39;ve used that converter.\r\n\r\nOne fix might be to go ahead and specific `x:Shared=false` in the resource. But IMHO that&#39;s not really a good way to do it. For one, it means that now you&#39;ve got a trap in your converter and have to remember that you need to specify that any time you put the converter in a resource dictionary. For another, you have another bug in the converter, where you add the values to the list every time the `Convert()` method is called. Which means that if you try to bind to values that may get updated from time to time, the list will get longer and longer, and will never eliminate the old values.\r\n\r\nYou could fix this by resetting the list every time the `Convert()` method is called, i.e. call `_value.Clear()`. But it&#39;s my opinion that that&#39;s still a design flaw. A converter should _convert_. It should not itself play a part in the result, as your implementation does here.\r\n\r\nAlternatives that IMHO would be preferable include:\r\n\r\n* Writing a `CompoundRelayCommand()` that incorporates the `GetCompoundExecute()` and `GetCompoundCanExecute()` functionality, which you create a new instance of every time the `Convert()` method is called.\r\n* Aggregate the input values in the `Convert()` method itself by creating a new multicast delegate that chains the input commands, and then pass that multicast delegate to the `RelayCommand()`.\r\n\r\nEither of those approaches would be much better than just updating what you have now by fixing the &quot;list isn&#39;t cleared&quot; bug and using `x:Shared=&quot;false&quot;` in the resource dictionary.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178368/wpf-aggregating-commands-using-multibinding-in-mvvm/58194731#58194731","title":"WPF Aggregating Commands using Multibinding in MVVM"}],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":8111339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93a3c9969cc52d7b687ee2290be5583e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"namg_engr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8111339/namg-engr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":73,"user_id":8111339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/93a3c9969cc52d7b687ee2290be5583e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"namg_engr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8111339/namg-engr"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58194731,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569985767,"creation_date":1569906502,"last_edit_date":1569942972,"question_id":58178368,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178368","body_markdown":"I&#39;m examining the solution of Leonid&#39;s command aggregating using multibinding in MVVM. https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/990113/MultiBinding-for-WPF-Command-Combining?msg=5666640#xx5666640xx I&#39;m having issues with this solution when using it in a menu. I&#39;ve added a simple menu with two items: item1 and item2. If menuitem item1 is selected then both menuitems item1 and item2 fire which is not what I want. Another aspect which I don&#39;t understand is if the XAML section which contains `&lt;Button.Command&gt;` is NOT commented then all four North, West, South and East commands fire when selecting menuitem item1. The multibinding for the button doesn&#39;t seem to be tied strictly to the button and is available to other controls.

This membership products has 8 different variations i.e. `Silver (Monthly, Quarterly, Half Year &amp; Yearly), Gold (Monthly, Quarterly, Half Year &amp; Yearly)`. To allow my members to upgrade or degrade their existing membership plans, i.e. to switch between silver monthly and gold monthly.\r\n\r\nI am showing this product (all its 8 variations in a pricing table) using a template file for this product only. When the product is in edit mode, I am placing the following shortcode in payment options section:\r\n\r\n`[woocommerce_one_page_checkout product_ids=&quot;1234&quot; template=&quot;pricing-table&quot;]`\r\n\r\nAlthough, I am getting the required variations of this product in pricing table form, however, the result do have a few issues. They are:\r\n\r\n1. The shortcode outputs the required variations, payment information and shipping/user information fields correctly, however, they appears twice on the front-end. To overcome this behavior of the shortcode, I am using `CSS display: none;` for sections which are appearing duplicate, like pricing table, shipping address and payment information etc.\r\n\r\n2. The payment information in both those duplicate sections (which are appearing twice as a result of the shortcode above) are disabled. Sometime, the credit card security code also appears more than a single time in both sections.\r\n\r\nI have tried using the shortcode in my functions.php file as well, but still I am getting the same issue. I am currently working on Avada child theme for customization purposes. How can I get around this issue? Any suggestion will highly be appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178367/why-woocommerce-one-page-checkout-shortcode-outputs-the-product-information-twic","title":"Why WooCommerce One Page Checkout Shortcode Outputs The Product Information Twice?"},{"tags":["bash","shell","xargs","inotify","gnu-parallel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569907670,"post_id":58178360,"comment_id":102737266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178360/how-to-run-an-inotify-shell-script-as-an-asynchronous-process#comment102737266_58178360"},{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":10337002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5574a5c094fddcea6aeabd609ce840da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Beeti Sushruth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10337002/beeti-sushruth"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569910531,"post_id":58178360,"comment_id":102738164,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178360/how-to-run-an-inotify-shell-script-as-an-asynchronous-process#comment102738164_58178360"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":10337002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5574a5c094fddcea6aeabd609ce840da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Beeti Sushruth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10337002/beeti-sushruth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569911135,"post_id":58178574,"comment_id":102738373,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178360/how-to-run-an-inotify-shell-script-as-an-asynchronous-process/58178574#comment102738373_58178574"},{"owner":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":46,"user_id":10337002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5574a5c094fddcea6aeabd609ce840da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Beeti Sushruth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10337002/beeti-sushruth"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569912749,"post_id":58178574,"comment_id":102739007,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178360/how-to-run-an-inotify-shell-script-as-an-asynchronous-process/58178574#comment102739007_58178574"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"last_editor":{"reputation":105680,"user_id":874188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091f411d57db5be8298e057a32e5ad72?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tripleee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/874188/tripleee"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569910624,"last_edit_date":1569910624,"creation_date":1569907904,"answer_id":58178574,"question_id":58178360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58178574","body_markdown":"There is no reason to have a pool of idle processes.

./ | while read FILE\r\n\r\ndo\r\n  echo &quot;started script&quot;;\r\n  sleep $(( $RANDOM % 10 ))s;\r\n  #some more process which takes time when a new file comes in\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did try to execute the script like this with xargs =&gt;\r\n```xargs -n1 -P3  bash sample.sh```\r\n\r\nSo whenever a new file comes in, it is getting processed thrice because of P3, but ideally i want one of the processes to pick this task which ever is idle.\r\n\r\nPlease shed some light on how to approach this problem?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178360/how-to-run-an-inotify-shell-script-as-an-asynchronous-process","title":"How to run an Inotify shell script as an asynchronous process"},{"tags":["angular","ng-build"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12903,"user_id":844322,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3zdWC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"A.T.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/844322/a-t"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569906763,"post_id":58178359,"comment_id":102737012,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178359/blank-screen-when-i-hit-ng-build-command#comment102737012_58178359"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":9283708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82b999865a503360818dddcc83c8b23f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pawan Sahu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9283708/pawan-sahu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569914972,"creation_date":1569914972,"answer_id":58179965,"question_id":58178359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58179965","body_markdown":"solved | i just echo -e &quot;export PATH=$(npm prefix -g)/bin:$PATH&quot;

have a problem where I need to predict the number of clicks based on Date, CPC(cost per click), Market(US or UK) and keywords(average length 3-4 words, max 6). So the features that I decided to input the model were:\r\n\r\n    Day(1-31)  WeekDay(0-6)  Month(1-12)   US-Market(0 or 1)  UK-Market(0 or 1)   CPC(continuous numeric)\r\n\r\nAnd the output is the continuous numeric Number of Clicks.\r\n\r\nFor Keywords I used keras tokenizer to convert to sequences and the padded those sequences. The I used the glove word embeddings and created an embedding matrix and fed to the nueral Network model as described [here][1] in pretrained glove embeddings section.\r\n\r\nThe model that I used is:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last Dense layer has linear activation. The model has two inputs (nlp_input for text data) and meta_input for (numerical,categorical data). Both models are concatenated after the Bidirectional LSTM to the nlp_input\r\nThe loss is :\r\n\r\n    model.compile(loss=&quot;mean_absolute_percentage_error&quot;, optimizer=opt,metrics=[&#39;acc&#39;])\r\n\r\nwhere `opt = Adam(lr=1e-3, decay=1e-3 / 200)`\r\n\r\nI trained the model for 100 epochs and the loss was close to 8000 at that point.\r\nBut when I apply prediction to the test they result in the same number for all test inputs and that number is even negative `-4.5 * e^-5`. Could someone guide me as to how should I approach this problem and what improvements could I do to the model.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://machinelearningmastery.com/use-word-embedding-layers-deep-learning-keras/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/QY1kF.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178345/a-multi-input-text-and-numeric-model-for-regression-giving-same-output","title":"A multi-input (text and numeric) model for regression giving same output"},{"tags":["android","android-viewpager","android-gridview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":160,"user_id":5705721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2mA9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Makarand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705721/makarand"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569906383,"post_id":58178342,"comment_id":102736920,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178342/to-update-item-in-adapter-inside-view-pager#comment102736920_58178342"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":801196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7c26734ece36201c69541c0d6cc9ef2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kshitij","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/801196/kshitij"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":160,"user_id":5705721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2mA9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Makarand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705721/makarand"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569906912,"post_id":58178342,"comment_id":102737046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178342/to-update-item-in-adapter-inside-view-pager#comment102737046_58178342"},{"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":3283350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hfjEh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ravi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3283350/ravi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569906929,"post_id":58178342,"comment_id":102737053,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178342/to-update-item-in-adapter-inside-view-pager#comment102737053_58178342"},{"owner":{"reputation":188,"user_id":10097275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1f7b0b7c248ac62b0f6cfbed321fb22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10097275/nik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569907014,"post_id":58178342,"comment_id":102737075,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178342/to-update-item-in-adapter-inside-view-pager#comment102737075_58178342"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":801196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7c26734ece36201c69541c0d6cc9ef2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kshitij","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/801196/kshitij"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":188,"user_id":10097275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1f7b0b7c248ac62b0f6cfbed321fb22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10097275/nik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569907319,"post_id":58178342,"comment_id":102737148,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178342/to-update-item-in-adapter-inside-view-pager#comment102737148_58178342"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":160,"user_id":5705721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/U2mA9.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Makarand","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5705721/makarand"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569914420,"creation_date":1569914420,"answer_id":58179837,"question_id":58178342,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58179837","body_markdown":"Follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1.

The case is I need to open a link which can only be opened in IE and might contains several query parameters and should be opened in IE from our web app which is running on Chrome (this is really annoying). After many tries and fails, I managed to find the [snippet][2] to add entry to the windows registry hive and made `.reg` file and run:\r\n\r\n    Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00\r\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ie]\r\n    &quot;URL Protocol&quot;=&quot;\\&quot;\\&quot;&quot;\r\n    @=&quot;\\&quot;URL:IE Protocol\\&quot;&quot;\r\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ie\\DefaultIcon]\r\n    @=&quot;\\&quot;explorer.exe,1\\&quot;&quot;\r\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ie\\shell]\r\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ie\\shell\\open]\r\n    [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Classes\\ie\\shell\\open\\command]\r\n    @=&quot;cmd /k set myvar=%1 &amp; call set myvar=%%myvar:ie:=%% &amp; call \\&quot;C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Internet Explorer\\\\iexplore.exe\\&quot; %%myvar%% &amp; exit /B&quot;\r\n\r\nIt worked but the problem is if a link contains more than 1 query params, all but the first are omitted, I am sure this because of character encoding in windows command line:\r\n\r\n    e.g. some_example_url?query1=value1&amp;query2=value2&amp;query3=value3 is becoming some_example_url?query1=value1\r\n\r\nI find this [solution][3] but it did not work either. How can I properly escape `&amp;` character, so that it can be opened on IE with all query parameters. (as before mentioned link is triggered by web app running on Chrome)\r\n\r\n**EDIT**: The code which triggers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    fileClicked(url) {\r\n      // url should be escaped with ^\r\n      const escapedUrl = url.replace(/&amp;/gi, &#39;^&amp;&#39;);\r\n      const ie = document.createElement(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n      // ie: scheme =&gt; custom protocol handler\r\n      // host computer (windows) should add custom protocol to windows registry\r\n      ie.href = `ie:${escapedUrl}`;\r\n      ie.click();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2**\r\n@muzafako fixed the script, just last line should be replaced like below:\r\n\r\n    @=&quot;cmd /c set url=\\&quot;%1\\&quot; &amp; call set url=%%url:ie:=%% &amp; call start iexplore -nosessionmerging -noframemerging %%url%%&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa767914(v=vs.85)?redirectedfrom=MSDN\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40531374/open-internet-explorer-from-chrome-using-a-protocol-handler-ieurl/41749105#41749105\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1327431/how-do-i-escape-ampersands-in-batch-files","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178298/how-to-escape-ampersand-in-custom-protocol-handler-in-windows","title":"How to escape &amp; ampersand in Custom protocol handler in Windows"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","list","function"],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12052274,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07a602ba9b27ec99ff3e5c37e3f81709?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12052274","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12052274/user12052274"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1569906294,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569905982,"creation_date":1569905982,"question_id":58178296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58178296","body_markdown":"The code - \r\n\r\n    def f(i=[]):\r\n      i.append(1)\r\n      return i\r\n    print(f())\r\n    print(f())\r\n\r\nThe Output -\r\n\r\n    [1]\r\n    [1, 1]\r\n\r\nWhy the function f() returns [1,1] as 2nd output instead of [1], because it assigns a new list every time when calling, but the list keeps appending the number...\r\nIs there any reason\r\n\r\nThank you","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178296/loop-and-list-python","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Loop and List - Python"},{"tags":["android","android-notifications","android-10.0"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":5742437,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208062683062172/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shahal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5742437/shahal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569913100,"post_id":58178377,"comment_id":102739173,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178293/notification-coloured-action-button-android-10/58178377#comment102739173_58178377"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":3283350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hfjEh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ravi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3283350/ravi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569906611,"creation_date":1569906611,"answer_id":58178377,"question_id":58178293,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58178377","body_markdown":"You can use custom layout in your notification.

want some advice on what is the best way to handle data , where is i need to table it and on the API there is a pagination endpoint is something like this\r\n\r\n    &quot;meta&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;pagination&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;total&quot;: 50,\r\n                &quot;count&quot;: 10,\r\n                &quot;per_page&quot;: 10,\r\n                &quot;current_page&quot;: 1,\r\n                &quot;total_pages&quot;: 5,\r\n                &quot;links&quot;: {\r\n                    &quot;next&quot;: &quot;http://192.168.1.1/api/sample/users?page=2&quot;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nwhat i did so far is do a for loop until i get all the data from the request but i &quot;worry if my data will turn into hundreds or thousands&quot; then save it to my state and call it in my table i used &lt;https://material-table.com&gt; to display, the idea i have is to create my own table cause in order to speed up what i think is every click of pagination it will request a certain page to get result rather than give me the whole data , but i worry also on how i will manage the search bar if i cant get the whole data. hope you can give me some tips or idea on how i will work on it or is there any react library that can handle the certain task?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178264/best-appoach-to-table-data-from-api-where-have-pagination-react","title":"Best appoach to Table data from API ? where have pagination

If you want sanity in the asm, compile as release instead. The problem is that a debugger is used to help confirm the logic of the underlying code. The logic in your underlying code is that it should call testfn() 10 times. As a result, you should be able to place a breakpoint on that method, and hit it at the correct point in the execution. In a release build, that breakpoint would never be hit (because it would have been optimised away). \r\n\r\nIn your case however, it&#39;s entirely incorrect to say that the constexpr is being ignored. You may notice that there are no calls to printf() in the generated asm, so the compiler has correctly identified that if (x == 2) can never be true, and has removed it. However, if the compiler removed the call to testfn() completely, your breakpoint would never be hit, and the debugger would basically be useless. \r\n\r\nDon&#39;t look at the output of a debug build and imagine it tells you anything useful about the code or compiler. You should expect the code to be deliberately de-optimised.

I would have hoped that they should not find any mention in the assembly code at all given that the `printf` in `testfn` will never be hit since `static constexpr int x=1`.\r\n\r\nI have 2 questions:\r\n\r\n(1)Perhaps in the Release build, the `for` loop is optimized away. How can I check this? Viewing the release build assembly code does not work for me even on using the Approach 2 specified at at: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1020498/how-to-view-the-assembly-behind-the-code-using-visual-c. The file with the assembly code is not produced at all.\r\n\r\n(2)In using `static constexpr int/double/char` as opposed to `#define`&#39;s, under what circumstances is one guaranteed that the former does not involve any unnecessary overhead (runtime computations/evaluations)? `#define`&#39;s, though much maligned, seem to offer much greater guarantee than `static constexpr`&#39;s in this regard.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58178258/compiler-optimization-of-static-constexpr","title":"Compiler optimization of static constexpr"},{"tags":["html","css","width","border","margin"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":551,"user_id":11700321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/REacU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EGC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11700321/egc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569906013,"creation_date":1569906013,"answer_id":58178297,"question_id":58178256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58178297","body_markdown":"This should do it!\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;style&gt;\r\n\r\n        div {\r\n          height: 300px;\r\n          width: 50%;\r\n          margin: 10px;
