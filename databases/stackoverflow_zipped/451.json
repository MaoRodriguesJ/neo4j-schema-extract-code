I want to implement text-based components and set up a package called com.gui.text.\r\n\r\nI have a &lt;code&gt;Font&lt;/code&gt; inside of that package which should be public so the user can pass it into one of the text components. However, I&#39;m struggling with how I transfer data like the texture id over to the text component without making the variable public (or implement a public getter).

you know, Vue.js (like many other SPA frameworks) expects that for any path that doesn&#39;t map to a specific file, the server falls back to serving the root `/index.html` file. Vue will then do routing in browser-side JavaScript. You mentioned that you know how to accomplish this fallback with `.htaccess`, but how can we do it with Workers?\r\n\r\nGood news: In Workers, we can write code to do whatever we want!\r\n\r\nIn fact, the worker code already has a specific block of code to handle &quot;404 not found&quot; errors. One way to solve the problem would be to change this block of code so that instead of returning the 404 error, it returns `/index.html`.\r\n\r\nThe code we want to change is this part:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // if an error is thrown try to serve the asset at 404.html\r\n    if (!DEBUG) {\r\n      try {\r\n        let notFoundResponse = await getAssetFromKV(event, {\r\n          mapRequestToAsset: req =&gt; new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/404.html`, req),\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        return new Response(notFoundResponse.body, { ...notFoundResponse, status: 404 })\r\n      } catch (e) {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return new Response(e.message || e.toString(), { status: 500 })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want to change it to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // Fall back to serving `/index.html` on errors.\r\n    return getAssetFromKV(event, {\r\n      mapRequestToAsset: req =&gt; new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/index.html`, req),\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should do the trick.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHowever, the above solution has a slight problem: For any HTML page (other than the root), it will do two lookups, first for the specific path, and only after that will it look for `/index.html` as a fallback. These lookups are pretty fast, but maybe we can make things faster by being a little bit smarter and detecting HTML pages upfront based on the URL.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we want to customize the `mapRequestToAsset` function. You can see a hint about this in a comment in the code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  /**\r\n   * You can add custom logic to how we fetch your assets\r\n   * by configuring the function `mapRequestToAsset`\r\n   */\r\n  // options.mapRequestToAsset = handlePrefix(/^\\/docs/)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go ahead and use it. Replace the above comment with this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  options.mapRequestToAsset = req =&gt; {\r\n    // First let&#39;s apply the default handler, which we imported from\r\n    // &#39;@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler&#39; at the top of the file. We do\r\n    // this because the default handler already has logic to detect\r\n    // paths that should map to HTML files, for which it appends\r\n    // `/index.html` to the path.\r\n    req = mapRequestToAsset(req)\r\n\r\n    // Now we can detect if the default handler decided to map to\r\n    // index.html in some specific directory.\r\n    if (req.url.endsWith(&#39;/index.html&#39;)) {\r\n      // Indeed. Let&#39;s change it to instead map to the root `/index.html`.\r\n      // This avoids the need to do a redundant lookup that we know will\r\n      // fail.\r\n      return new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/index.html`, req)\r\n    } else {\r\n      // The default handler decided this is not an HTML page.

The easiest way I can think of would be to turn each row into a tuple of the right types then use implicit DF creation to convert to a DataFrame.  You were pretty close in your code, you just need to cast the elements to an acceptable type. \r\n\r\nBasically `toDF` knows how to convert tuples (with accepted types) into a DF Row, and you can pass the column names into the `toDF` call.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    val data = Array(1556273771, &quot;Mumbai&quot;, 1189193, 1189198, 0.56, -1, &quot;India,Australia&quot;, 1571215104, 1571215166)\r\n    val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(data))\r\n    \r\n    val df = rdd.map {\r\n        case Array(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) =&gt; (\r\n            a.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            b.asInstanceOf[String],\r\n            c.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            d.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            e.toString.toDouble,\r\n            f.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            g.asInstanceOf[String],\r\n            h.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            i.asInstanceOf[Int]\r\n        )\r\n    }.toDF(&quot;int1&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;int2&quot;, &quot;int3&quot;, &quot;float1&quot;, &quot;int4&quot;, &quot;country&quot;, &quot;int5&quot;, &quot;int6&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    df.printSchema\r\n    df.show(100, false)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    scala&gt; df.printSchema\r\n    root\r\n     |-- int1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- city: string (nullable = true)\r\n     |-- int2: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int3: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- float1: double (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int4: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- country: string (nullable = true)\r\n     |-- int5: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int6: integer (nullable = false)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    scala&gt; df.show(100, false)\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n    |int1      |city  |int2   |int3   |float1|int4|country        |int5      |int6      |\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n    |1556273771|Mumbai|1189193|1189198|0.56  |-1  |India,Australia|1571215104|1571215166|\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit for 0 -&gt; Double:**\r\n\r\nAs Andr&#233; pointed out, if you start off with 0 as an Any it will be a java Integer, not a scala Int, and therefore not castable to a scala Double.

developer here. Your intuition is correct.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: **`inlinedAccess` creates a new object every time. `constantAccess` is more efficient, because it avoids recreating the object on every invocation. For even better performance, use a `Map`.**\r\n\r\nThe fact that a &quot;quick test&quot; yields the same timings for both functions illustrates how easily microbenchmarks can be misleading ;-)\r\n\r\n- Creating objects like the object in your example is quite fast, so the impact is hard to measure. You can amplify the impact of repeated object creation by making it more expensive, e.g. replacing one property with `b: new Array(100),`.\r\n- The number-to-string conversion and subsequent string concatenation in `&#39;result: &#39; + ...` contribute quite a bit to the overall time; you can drop that to get a clearer signal.\r\n- For a small benchmark, you have to be careful not to let the compiler optimize away everything. Assigning the result to a global variable does the trick.\r\n- It also makes a huge difference whether you always look up the same property, or different properties. Object lookup in JavaScript is not exactly a simple (== fast) operation; V8 has a very fast optimization/caching strategy when it&#39;s always the same property (and the same object shape) at a given site, but for varying properties (or object shapes) it has to do much costlier lookups.\r\n- `Map` lookups for varying keys are faster than object property lookups. Using objects as maps is so 2010, modern JavaScript has proper `Map`s, so use them! :-)\r\n- `Array` element lookups are even faster, but of course you can only use them when your keys are integers.\r\n- When the number of possible keys being looked up is small, switch statements are hard to beat. They don&#39;t scale well to large numbers of keys though.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s put all of those thoughts into code:\r\n\r\n    function inlinedAccess(key) {\r\n      const inlinedLookupTable = {\r\n        a: 1,\r\n        b: new Array(100),\r\n        c: 3,\r\n        d: 4,\r\n      }\r\n      return inlinedLookupTable[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const CONSTANT_TABLE = {\r\n      a: 1,\r\n      b: new Array(100),\r\n      c: 3,\r\n      d: 4,\r\n    }\r\n    function constantAccess(key) {\r\n      return CONSTANT_TABLE[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const LOOKUP_MAP = new Map([\r\n      [&quot;a&quot;, 1],\r\n      [&quot;b&quot;, new Array(100)],\r\n      [&quot;c&quot;, 3],\r\n      [&quot;d&quot;, 4]\r\n    ]);\r\n    function mapAccess(key) {\r\n      return LOOKUP_MAP.get(key);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const ARRAY_TABLE = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]\r\n    function integerAccess(key) {\r\n      return ARRAY_TABLE[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function switchAccess(key) {\r\n      switch (key) {\r\n        case &quot;a&quot;: return 1;\r\n        case &quot;b&quot;: return new Array(100);\r\n        case &quot;c&quot;: return 3;\r\n        case &quot;d&quot;: return 4;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const kCount = 10000000;\r\n    let result = null;\r\n    let t1 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = inlinedAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = inlinedAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t2 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = constantAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = constantAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t3 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = mapAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = mapAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t4 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = integerAccess(0);\r\n      result = integerAccess(3);\r\n    }\r\n    let t5 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = switchAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = switchAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t6 = Date.now();\r\n    console.log(&quot;inlinedAccess: &quot; + (t2 - t1));\r\n    console.log(&quot;constantAccess: &quot; + (t3 - t2));\r\n    console.log(&quot;mapAccess: &quot; + (t4 - t3));\r\n    console.log(&quot;integerAccess: &quot; + (t5 - t4));\r\n    console.log(&quot;switchAccess: &quot; + (t6 - t5));\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting the following results:\r\n\r\n    inlinedAccess: 1613\r\n    constantAccess: 194\r\n    mapAccess: 95\r\n    integerAccess: 15\r\n    switchAccess: 9\r\n\r\nAll that said: these numbers are &quot;milliseconds for 10M lookups&quot;. In a real-world application, the differences are probably too small to matter, so you can write whatever code is most readable/maintainable/etc. For example, if you only do 100K lookups, the results are:\r\n\r\n    inlinedAccess: 31\r\n    constantAccess: 6\r\n    mapAccess: 6\r\n    integerAccess: 5\r\n    switchAccess: 4\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy the way, a common variant of this situation is creating/calling functions. This:\r\n\r\n    function singleton_callback(...) { ... }\r\n    function efficient(...) {\r\n      return singleton_callback(...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nis much more efficient than this:\r\n\r\n    function wasteful(...) {\r\n      function new_callback_every_time(...) { ... }\r\n      return new_callback_every_time(...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd similarly, this:\r\n\r\n    function singleton_method(args) { ... }\r\n    function EfficientObjectConstructor(param) {\r\n      this.___ = param;\r\n      this.method = singleton_method;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nis much more efficient than this:\r\n\r\n    function WastefulObjectConstructor(param) {\r\n      this.___ = param;\r\n      this.method = function(...) { \r\n        // Allocates a new function every time.\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(Of course the usual way of doing it is `Constructor.prototype.method = function(...) {...}`, which also avoids repeated function creations. Or, nowadays, you can just use `class`es.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432310/do-javascript-engines-optimize-constants-defined-within-closures/58436106#58436106","title":"Do javascript engines optimize constants defined within closures?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1835,"user_id":1527562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92c91d356450f2102b1bdb4a0416d9e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mogelbrod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1527562/mogelbrod"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1835,"user_id":1527562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92c91d356450f2102b1bdb4a0416d9e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mogelbrod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1527562/mogelbrod"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":125,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58436106,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571395778,"creation_date":1571314082,"last_edit_date":1571395778,"question_id":58432310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58432310","body_markdown":"Imagine I have a function which accesses a constant (never mutated) variable (lookup table or array, for example). The constant is not referenced anywhere outside the function scope.\r\nMy intuition tells me that I should define this constant outside the function scope (**Option A** below) to avoid (re-)creating it on every function invocation, but is this really the way modern Javascript engines work? I&#39;d like to think that modern engines can see that the constant is never modified, and thus only has to create and cache it once (_is there a term for this?_). Do browsers cache functions defined within closures in the same way?\r\n\r\nAre there any non-negligible performance penalties to simply defining the constant inside the function, right next to where it&#39;s accessed (**Option B**)?

implementation of peak detection looks ok.\r\n\r\nYour code for the timing is a bit off though.\r\n\r\nWhat you&#39;re doing:\r\n\r\n    read sensor 1\r\n    read sensor 2\r\n    if value 1 is a new max:\r\n      store timestamp 1  \r\n    if it is a new peak:\r\n      report new peak through serial\r\n      register timestamp 1 as time for peak 1\r\n    if value 2 is a new max:\r\n      store

issues with that:\r\n\r\na) you do not store the time of your measurement but the time when you find out that it is a new maximum. as you have serial communication between the measurement with sensor

That means when you convert the byte to an `int` and the high bit is set, the value will be sign-extended (for example binary `10000001` will be sign-extended to `1111111111111111111111111000001`).\r\n\r\nThis of course affect your bitwise operations.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use an explicit *unsigned* data type, i.e. `unsigned char`.

To explain it briefly:\r\n\r\n- I create an `int`.\r\n- I create a `char*` array pointing the first byte of the previously created `int` (to simulate that I have a real `int` stored in a `char*` buffer). Its size is consequently 4.\r\n- I display the `int` and its binary representation\r\n- I display the `int` and the concatenation of each bytes stored in the `char*` buffer to compare that they are the same (in reverse order due to endianness purposes).\r\n- Try to get the original `int` back from the buffer.\r\n- I display the reconstructed `int` as well as its binary representation.\r\n\r\nI performed this procedure for **both negative and positive values**. This is why the code is less readable as it should be (sorry for that).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the negative value could be reconstructed successfully, but it did not work for the positive one (I expected `5000` and I got `-120`).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve made the test with several other negative values and positive values and the conclusion is still the same, it works fine with negative numbers but fails with positive numbers.\r\n\r\n**Question:** I&#39;m in trouble to understand why does concatenating 4 `chars` into an `int` via bit-wise shifts change the `char` values for positive numbers when they stay unchanged with negative values ?\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the binary representation, we can see that the reconstructed numbers is not composed of the `char`s that I have concatenated.\r\n\r\nIs it related with the `static_cast&lt;int&gt;` ? If I remove it, the integral promotion rule will implicitly apply it anyway. But I need this to be done since I need to convert it into an `int` in order to not lose the result of the shifts.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nIf this is the heart of the issue, how to solve it ?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Additionally:** Is there a better way to get back the value than bit-wise shifting ? Something that is not dependent to the endianness of the system/platform.\r\n\r\n_Perhaps this should be another separate question._","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432136/reading-an-int-through-char-buffer-behaves-different-whether-it-is-positive-or","title":"Reading an int through char* buffer behaves

As part of the build we use a custom test runner to perform certain tests.\r\n\r\nWhen running in AppVeyor we call the REST API directly from the test runner to inform the build server of the tests being run and to update their status. This is quite straightforward, as shown in the REST sections of their [Add Tests][1] and [Update Tests][2] documentation, and gives us great integration into AppVeyor&#39;s UI.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been researching how to do the same in Azure DevOps. I&#39;ve found a section of the REST API for [adding][3] and [updating][4] test results. It isn&#39;t entirely clear from the API documentation if this is what I would use during a running pipeline, or if this is for some other scenario. I&#39;ve searched for others trying to do the same thing, but without any luck so far. Most examples talk about uploading a test results file, but this seems a rather indirect way of getting the test results published, especially as I would like to register all the tests before they are run and then update their status as they are completed.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any pointers or examples around publishing test results using the Azure DevOps API during a build?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Instead, you would need to adapt the paste operation in some way so that the destination range fully includes all cells that are part of a merged range.  There are some APIs in the [IRange interface][1] that can help you determine if a given IRange is part of a merged range and return adjusted IRanges to account for this:\r\n\r\n - IRange.[MergeCells][2] - Gets or sets the property which specifies whether the top left cell of this IRange is merged.\r\n - IRange.[MergeCellsDefined][5] - Returns true if the MergeCells property of all cells represented by this IRange is false or if all cells represented by this IRange are contained by the same merged cell area, otherwise false is returned.\r\n - IRange.[MergeArea][3] - Returns an IRange representing the merged cell area if the cell represented by this single cell IRange is part of a merged cell range, otherwise the original IRange is returned.\r\n - IRange.[EntireMergeArea][4] - Returns an IRange representing the area of the current IRange which is iteratively grown as needed until it includes no partial merged cells.\r\n\r\nBelow is some sample code that demonstrates how you can use some of the above APIs to deal with your case.

The function `f()` has a complex signature with many input and output arguments. The actual signature looks like this:\r\n\r\n    Void f(MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Matrix`1[System.Double],\r\n           MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Matrix`1[System.Double],\r\n           MathNet.Numerics.LinearAlgebra.Matrix`1[System.Double],\r\n           Double[,], Double[,], Double, Double, Double,\r\n           Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef,\r\n           Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef,\r\n           Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef, Double ByRef)\r\n\r\nI am trying to call this function using `python.net` package. My call fails with error:\r\n\r\n    No method matches given arguments for f\r\n\r\n## What I tried ##\r\nI know that the appropriate dotnet function is selected from python.net by its signature. I can read the expected signature of function f by accessing the imported dotnet class:\r\n\r\n    mydotnetclass.f.Overloads\r\n\r\nMy problem is, that I do not know what signature my current function call is creating and therefore I can not see, which parameter is causing the signature match to fail. Unfortunately it is not possibly with python.net to explicitly call a specific overload to override the signature match.\r\n\r\nI did my best to match the signature of the input parameters. The generic matrix type I created using\r\n\r\n    matrixArgument = LinearAlgebra.Double.Matrix.Build.DenseOfRowArrays(list(numpy_ndMatrix))\r\n    arrayArg = clr.System.Array.CreateInstance(clr.System.Double,numpyArray.shape[0],numpyArray.shape[1])\r\n\r\nFor Double arguments I used ordinary python double type variables as well as `clr.System.Double()` types.\r\n\r\nThe return variables where left un-initialized.\r\n\r\n## Question ##\r\nCan I display the signature created by a function/method call to a dotnet function? For example in this situation\r\n\r\n    a=1.0\r\n    b=1\r\n    c=&quot;abc&quot;\r\n    x,y = mydotnetclass.g(a,b,c)\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to see the following signature\r\n\r\n    Void mydotnetclass.g(Double, int, String, Double byref, String byref)\r\n\r\nI is obvious that the return parameters signature part can not be derived from the call it self but only from the implementation of function `g()`.\r\n\r\n*At least I need to know which parameters are causing the signature mismatch!*","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432349/how-to-debug-python-function-signature-when-call-of-dotnet-function-with-python","title":"How to debug python function signature when call of dotnet function with python.net fails"},{"tags":["java","jigsaw"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":368,"user_id":9896706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EzvAP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Remco Buddelmeijer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9896706/remco-buddelmeijer"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571314372,"post_id":58432348,"comment_id":103205215,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432348/can-two-exported-classes-in-different-packages-interact-without-making-their-mem#comment103205215_58432348"},{"owner":{"reputation":351,"user_id":10835645,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06ddd347aa1f8b8540c5188b08331ef2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.

you know, Vue.js (like many other SPA frameworks) expects that for any path that doesn&#39;t map to a specific file, the server falls back to serving the root `/index.html` file. Vue will then do routing in browser-side JavaScript. You mentioned that you know how to accomplish this fallback with `.htaccess`, but how can we do it with Workers?\r\n\r\nGood news: In Workers, we can write code to do whatever we want!\r\n\r\nIn fact, the worker code already has a specific block of code to handle &quot;404 not found&quot; errors. One way to solve the problem would be to change this block of code so that instead of returning the 404 error, it returns `/index.html`.\r\n\r\nThe code we want to change is this part:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // if an error is thrown try to serve the asset at 404.html\r\n    if (!DEBUG) {\r\n      try {\r\n        let notFoundResponse = await getAssetFromKV(event, {\r\n          mapRequestToAsset: req =&gt; new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/404.html`, req),\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        return new Response(notFoundResponse.body, { ...notFoundResponse, status: 404 })\r\n      } catch (e) {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return new Response(e.message || e.toString(), { status: 500 })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe want to change it to:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // Fall back to serving `/index.html` on errors.\r\n    return getAssetFromKV(event, {\r\n      mapRequestToAsset: req =&gt; new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/index.html`, req),\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat should do the trick.\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nHowever, the above solution has a slight problem: For any HTML page (other than the root), it will do two lookups, first for the specific path, and only after that will it look for `/index.html` as a fallback. These lookups are pretty fast, but maybe we can make things faster by being a little bit smarter and detecting HTML pages upfront based on the URL.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we want to customize the `mapRequestToAsset` function. You can see a hint about this in a comment in the code:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  /**\r\n   * You can add custom logic to how we fetch your assets\r\n   * by configuring the function `mapRequestToAsset`\r\n   */\r\n  // options.mapRequestToAsset = handlePrefix(/^\\/docs/)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s go ahead and use it. Replace the above comment with this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n  options.mapRequestToAsset = req =&gt; {\r\n    // First let&#39;s apply the default handler, which we imported from\r\n    // &#39;@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler&#39; at the top of the file. We do\r\n    // this because the default handler already has logic to detect\r\n    // paths that should map to HTML files, for which it appends\r\n    // `/index.html` to the path.\r\n    req = mapRequestToAsset(req)\r\n\r\n    // Now we can detect if the default handler decided to map to\r\n    // index.html in some specific directory.\r\n    if (req.url.endsWith(&#39;/index.html&#39;)) {\r\n      // Indeed. Let&#39;s change it to instead map to the root `/index.html`.\r\n      // This avoids the need to do a redundant lookup that we know will\r\n      // fail.\r\n      return new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/index.html`, req)\r\n    } else {\r\n      // The default handler decided this is not an HTML page. It&#39;s probably\r\n      // an image, CSS, or JS file. Leave it as-is.\r\n      return req\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the code detects specifically HTML requests and replaces them with the root `/index.html`, so there&#39;s no need to waste time looking up a file that doesn&#39;t exist only to catch the resulting error. For other kinds of files (images, JS, CSS, etc.) the code will not modify the filename.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432345/cloudflare-workers-spa-with-vuejs/58439234#58439234","title":"Cloudflare Workers - SPA with Vuejs"}],"owner":{"reputation":2866,"user_id":1967886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af0513c67e1b40e447c1520c04f199ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marcos Aguayo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1967886/marcos-aguayo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2866,"user_id":1967886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af0513c67e1b40e447c1520c04f199ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marcos Aguayo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1967886/marcos-aguayo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58439234,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571339142,"creation_date":1571314183,"last_edit_date":1571315371,"question_id":58432345,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58432345","body_markdown":"Hello I have deployed my Vue.js app to Cloudflare workers using the following commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwrangler generate --site\r\nwrangler publish --env dev\r\n```\r\nThis is my wrangler.toml:\r\n```\r\naccount_id = &quot;xxx&quot;\r\nname = &quot;name&quot;\r\ntype = &quot;webpack&quot;\r\nworkers_dev = true\r\n\r\n[site]\r\nbucket = &quot;./dist&quot;\r\nentry-point = &quot;workers-site&quot;\r\n\r\n[env.dev]\r\nname = &quot;name&quot;\r\nroute = &quot;xxx.com/*&quot;\r\nzone_id = &quot;XXX&quot;\r\naccount_id = &quot;XXX&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe website is fine and live on &quot;xxx.com&quot; but when I refresh the page on any other route I get this error message:\r\n\r\n&gt; could not find es-es/index.html in your content namespace\r\n\r\nOr for example:\r\n\r\n&gt; could not find category/65/index.html in your content namespace\r\n\r\nOn nginx I had to create a .htaccess, but I have no idea on how to make it work here.\r\n\r\nThis is my index.js in case it helps:\r\n```\r\nimport { getAssetFromKV, mapRequestToAsset } from &#39;@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler&#39;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The DEBUG flag will do two things that help during development:\r\n * 1. we will skip caching on the edge, which makes it easier to\r\n *    debug.\r\n * 2. we will return an error message on exception in your Response rather\r\n *    than the default 404.html page.\r\n */\r\nconst DEBUG = false\r\n\r\naddEventListener(&#39;fetch&#39;, event =&gt; {\r\n  try {\r\n    event.respondWith(handleEvent(event))\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    if (DEBUG) {\r\n      return event.respondWith(\r\n        new Response(e.message || e.toString(), {\r\n          status: 500,\r\n        }),\r\n      )\r\n    }\r\n    event.respondWith(new Response(&#39;Internal Error&#39;, { status: 500 }))\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nasync function handleEvent(event) {\r\n  const url = new URL(event.request.url)\r\n  let options = {}\r\n\r\n  /**\r\n   * You can add custom logic to how we fetch your assets\r\n   * by configuring the function `mapRequestToAsset`\r\n   */\r\n  // options.mapRequestToAsset = handlePrefix(/^\\/docs/)\r\n\r\n  try {\r\n    if (DEBUG) {\r\n      // customize caching\r\n      options.cacheControl = {\r\n        bypassCache: true,\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    return await getAssetFromKV(event, options)\r\n  } catch (e) {\r\n    // if an error is thrown try to serve the asset at 404.html\r\n    if (!DEBUG) {\r\n      try {\r\n        let notFoundResponse = await getAssetFromKV(event, {\r\n          mapRequestToAsset: req =&gt; new Request(`${new URL(req.url).origin}/404.html`, req),\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        return new Response(notFoundResponse.body, { ...notFoundResponse, status: 404 })\r\n      } catch (e) {}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return new Response(e.message || e.toString(), { status: 500 })\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Here&#39;s one example of how to modify a request to\r\n * remove a specific prefix, in this case `/docs` from\r\n * the url.

You were pretty close in your code, you just need to cast the elements to an acceptable type. \r\n\r\nBasically `toDF` knows how to convert tuples (with accepted types) into a DF Row, and you can pass the column names into the `toDF` call.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    val data = Array(1556273771, &quot;Mumbai&quot;, 1189193, 1189198, 0.56, -1, &quot;India,Australia&quot;, 1571215104, 1571215166)\r\n    val rdd = sc.parallelize(Seq(data))\r\n    \r\n    val df = rdd.map {\r\n        case Array(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) =&gt; (\r\n            a.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            b.asInstanceOf[String],\r\n            c.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            d.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            e.toString.toDouble,\r\n            f.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            g.asInstanceOf[String],\r\n            h.asInstanceOf[Int],\r\n            i.asInstanceOf[Int]\r\n        )\r\n    }.toDF(&quot;int1&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;int2&quot;, &quot;int3&quot;, &quot;float1&quot;, &quot;int4&quot;, &quot;country&quot;, &quot;int5&quot;, &quot;int6&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    df.printSchema\r\n    df.show(100, false)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    scala&gt; df.printSchema\r\n    root\r\n     |-- int1: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- city: string (nullable = true)\r\n     |-- int2: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int3: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- float1: double (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int4: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- country: string (nullable = true)\r\n     |-- int5: integer (nullable = false)\r\n     |-- int6: integer (nullable = false)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    scala&gt; df.show(100, false)\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n    |int1      |city  |int2   |int3   |float1|int4|country        |int5      |int6      |\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n    |1556273771|Mumbai|1189193|1189198|0.56  |-1  |India,Australia|1571215104|1571215166|\r\n    +----------+------+-------+-------+------+----+---------------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit for 0 -&gt; Double:**\r\n\r\nAs Andr&#233; pointed out, if you start off with 0 as an Any it will be a java Integer, not a scala Int, and therefore not castable to a scala Double.  Converting it to a string first lets you then convert it into a double as desired.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432322/how-to-convert-rddarrayany-to-dataframe/58435044#58435044","title":"How to convert RDD[Array[Any]] to DataFrame?"}],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":9014539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Sc2hzVkI4wc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAp4/dQvJVWHvLJQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"padmanabh pande","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9014539/padmanabh-pande"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5116,"user_id":6933993,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rS8O.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thebluephantom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6933993/thebluephantom"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571324963,"creation_date":1571314123,"last_edit_date":1571321378,"question_id":58432322,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58432322","body_markdown":"I have RDD[Array[Any]] as follows,\r\n\r\n&lt;three rows: each containing 10 elements&gt;\r\n    \r\n    1556273771,Mumbai,1189193,1189198,0.56,-1,India,Australia,1571215104,1571215166\r\n    8374749403,London,1189193,1189198,0,1,India,England,4567362933,9374749392\r\n    7439430283,Dubai,1189193,1189198,0.76,-1,Pakistan,Sri Lanka,1576615684,4749383749\r\n\r\nI need to convert this to a data frame of 10 columns, but I am new to spark.

developer here. Your intuition is correct.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: **`inlinedAccess` creates a new object every time. `constantAccess` is more efficient, because it avoids recreating the object on every invocation. For even better performance, use a `Map`.**\r\n\r\nThe fact that a &quot;quick test&quot; yields the same timings for both functions illustrates how easily microbenchmarks can be misleading ;-)\r\n\r\n- Creating objects like the object in your example is quite fast, so the impact is hard to measure. You can amplify the impact of repeated object creation by making it more expensive, e.g. replacing one property with `b: new Array(100),`.\r\n- The number-to-string conversion and subsequent string concatenation in `&#39;result: &#39; + ...` contribute quite a bit to the overall time; you can drop that to get a clearer signal.\r\n- For a small benchmark, you have to be careful not to let the compiler optimize away everything. Assigning the result to a global variable does the trick.\r\n- It also makes a huge difference whether you always look up the same property, or different properties. Object lookup in JavaScript is not exactly a simple (== fast) operation; V8 has a very fast optimization/caching strategy when it&#39;s always the same property (and the same object shape) at a given site, but for varying properties (or object shapes) it has to do much costlier lookups.\r\n- `Map` lookups for varying keys are faster than object property lookups. Using objects as maps is so 2010, modern JavaScript has proper `Map`s, so use them! :-)\r\n- `Array` element lookups are even faster, but of course you can only use them when your keys are integers.\r\n- When the number of possible keys being looked up is small, switch statements are hard to beat. They don&#39;t scale well to large numbers of keys though.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s put all of those thoughts into code:\r\n\r\n    function inlinedAccess(key) {\r\n      const inlinedLookupTable = {\r\n        a: 1,\r\n        b: new Array(100),\r\n        c: 3,\r\n        d: 4,\r\n      }\r\n      return inlinedLookupTable[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const CONSTANT_TABLE = {\r\n      a: 1,\r\n      b: new Array(100),\r\n      c: 3,\r\n      d: 4,\r\n    }\r\n    function constantAccess(key) {\r\n      return CONSTANT_TABLE[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const LOOKUP_MAP = new Map([\r\n      [&quot;a&quot;, 1],\r\n      [&quot;b&quot;, new Array(100)],\r\n      [&quot;c&quot;, 3],\r\n      [&quot;d&quot;, 4]\r\n    ]);\r\n    function mapAccess(key) {\r\n      return LOOKUP_MAP.get(key);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const ARRAY_TABLE = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]\r\n    function integerAccess(key) {\r\n      return ARRAY_TABLE[key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function switchAccess(key) {\r\n      switch (key) {\r\n        case &quot;a&quot;: return 1;\r\n        case &quot;b&quot;: return new Array(100);\r\n        case &quot;c&quot;: return 3;\r\n        case &quot;d&quot;: return 4;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const kCount = 10000000;\r\n    let result = null;\r\n    let t1 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = inlinedAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = inlinedAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t2 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = constantAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = constantAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t3 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = mapAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = mapAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t4 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = integerAccess(0);\r\n      result = integerAccess(3);\r\n    }\r\n    let t5 = Date.now();\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; kCount; i++) {\r\n      result = switchAccess(&quot;a&quot;);\r\n      result = switchAccess(&quot;d&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    let t6 = Date.now();\r\n    console.log(&quot;inlinedAccess: &quot; + (t2 - t1));\r\n    console.log(&quot;constantAccess: &quot; + (t3 - t2));\r\n    console.log(&quot;mapAccess: &quot; + (t4 - t3));\r\n    console.log(&quot;integerAccess: &quot; + (t5 - t4));\r\n    console.log(&quot;switchAccess: &quot; + (t6 - t5));\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting the following results:\r\n\r\n    inlinedAccess: 1613\r\n    constantAccess: 194\r\n    mapAccess: 95\r\n    integerAccess: 15\r\n    switchAccess: 9\r\n\r\nAll that said: these numbers are &quot;milliseconds for 10M lookups&quot;. In a real-world application, the differences are probably too small to matter, so you can write whatever code is most readable/maintainable/etc. For example, if you only do 100K lookups, the results are:\r\n\r\n    inlinedAccess: 31\r\n    constantAccess: 6\r\n    mapAccess: 6\r\n    integerAccess: 5\r\n    switchAccess: 4\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy the way, a common variant of this situation is creating/calling functions. This:\r\n\r\n    function singleton_callback(...) { ... }\r\n    function efficient(...) {\r\n      return singleton_callback(...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nis much more efficient than this:\r\n\r\n    function wasteful(...) {\r\n      function new_callback_every_time(...) { ... }\r\n      return new_callback_every_time(...);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd similarly, this:\r\n\r\n    function singleton_method(args) { ... }\r\n    function EfficientObjectConstructor(param) {\r\n      this.___ = param;\r\n      this.method = singleton_method;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nis much more efficient than this:\r\n\r\n    function WastefulObjectConstructor(param) {\r\n      this.___ = param;\r\n      this.method = function(...) { \r\n        // Allocates a new function every time.\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(Of course the usual way of doing it is `Constructor.prototype.method = function(...) {...}`, which also avoids repeated function creations. Or, nowadays, you can just use `class`es.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58432310/do-javascript-engines-optimize-constants-defined-within-closures/58436106#58436106","title":"Do javascript engines optimize constants defined within closures?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1835,"user_id":1527562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92c91d356450f2102b1bdb4a0416d9e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mogelbrod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1527562/mogelbrod"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1835,"user_id":1527562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92c91d356450f2102b1bdb4a0416d9e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mogelbrod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1527562/mogelbrod"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":125,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58436106,"answer_count":1,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571395778,"creation_date":1571314082,"last_edit_date":1571395778,"question_id":58432310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58432310","body_markdown":"Imagine I have a function which accesses a constant (never mutated) variable (lookup table or array, for example). The constant is not referenced anywhere outside the function scope.\r\nMy intuition tells me that I should define this constant outside the function scope (**Option A** below) to avoid (re-)creating it on every function invocation, but is this really the way modern Javascript engines work? I&#39;d like to think that modern engines can see that the constant is never modified, and thus only has to create and cache it once (_is there a term for this?_). Do browsers cache functions defined within closures in the same way?\r\n\r\nAre there any non-negligible performance penalties to simply defining the constant inside the function, right next to where it&#39;s accessed (**Option B**)?

implementation of peak detection looks ok.\r\n\r\nYour code for the timing is a bit off though.\r\n\r\nWhat you&#39;re doing:\r\n\r\n    read sensor 1\r\n    read sensor 2\r\n    if value 1 is a new max:\r\n      store timestamp 1  \r\n    if it is a new peak:\r\n      report new peak through serial\r\n      register timestamp 1 as time for peak 1\r\n    if value 2 is a new max:\r\n      store

issues with that:\r\n\r\na) you do not store the time of your measurement but the time when you find out that it is a new maximum. as you have serial communication between the measurement with sensor
