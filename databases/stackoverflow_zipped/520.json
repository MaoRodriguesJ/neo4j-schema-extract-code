How would I best approach this?\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;m doing:\r\nI am creating a search page to display results from my database of events. It works fine and sorts and filters according to the criteria I have. I want to add the ability to filter by category as well. Each event in my table can have multiple categories. I want to make it so that when I mark that category in my search form, it displays items from that category only.\r\n\r\nTherefore I can check the box &quot;Category ID 24&quot; in my search and filter form and it will output events like\r\n```\r\nEVENT: Magic Show\r\nWhen: Oct 9th, 2:00pm\r\nCategories: 24, 32, 15\r\n```\r\nsince Category 24 was one of the categories for this event.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I have it &quot;working&quot; by taking each result and doing a second SQL call to check to see if it belongs to that category, which is resource-intensive but effective. I also got a &quot;better&quot; version working where it checks against a string of category ids and decides whether to show it. Effective, but still not proper code.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this difficult are my tables. I have a table Events, which contain information about each event, a table Categories, which lists all possible categories, and one called EventCategories which assigns each eventID to a categoryID, one per row.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my SQL:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    e.ID, \r\n    e.Title, \r\n    GROUP_CONCAT(c.ID SEPARATOR &#39;  &amp;middot;  &#39;) as Categories\r\nFROM \r\n    Events e\r\n    LEFT JOIN EventCategories ec ON ec.EventID = e.ID \r\n    LEFT JOIN Categories c ON c.ID = ec.CategoryID\r\n\t\r\nWHERE\r\n\t&quot;.$cond.&quot;\r\nORDER BY \r\n    e.Title DESC\r\n```\r\nThe Group Contact works so that when I type $row[&#39;Categories&#39;] it displays something like 23 &#183; 28 &#183; 26. This is great, but I&#39;d need to put this in my WHERE clause to check against these numbers, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck.\r\n\r\nI need to make this so that I can say something like &quot;WHERE all events with category &#39;23&#39;&quot; will display. I&#39;m grabbing the category from the POST data, do that&#39;s not a problem, but the tricky part is writing the WHERE clause for a varied number of categories.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416571/how-can-i-put-multiple-checkbox-results-in-a-where-clause-in-sql","title":"How can I put multiple checkbox results in a WHERE clause

happens based on file offsets. The goal of splitting the file and store it into different blocks, is parallel processing and fail over of data.\r\n\r\nSplit is logical split of the data, basically used during data processing using Map/Reduce program or other data-processing techniques in Hadoop. Split size is user defined value and one can choose his own split size based on the volume of data(How much data you are processing).\r\n\r\nSplit is basically used to control number of Mapper in Map/Reduce program.

I published it via Windows Application Packaging Project. Because it&#39;s WPF app, I needed to add this to appxmanifest:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Extensions&gt;\r\n      &lt;uap5:Extension\r\n        Category=&quot;windows.appExecutionAlias&quot;\r\n        Executable=&quot;MyApp.exe&quot;\r\n        EntryPoint=&quot;MyApp&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;uap5:AppExecutionAlias&gt;\r\n          &lt;uap5:ExecutionAlias Alias=&quot;MyApp.exe&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/uap5:AppExecutionAlias&gt;\r\n      &lt;/uap5:Extension&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Extensions&gt;\r\n\r\nThen I published the WPF app as sideloaded and it works just fine when I start it from the Windows Start menu. The problem is that I need to start it from command line and I need to pass few command line arguments. But, when I start the app from command line by typing the alias, it only passes this argument:\r\n-ServerName:App.App7adfdfg54shnsdfh87asrgsdfg1.mca\r\nwhich is not my argument - mine arguments are not passed at all. So then I tried to add this to my WPF .csproj file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Reference Include=&quot;Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;HintPath&gt;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\References\\10.0.18362.0\\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract\\8.0.0.0\\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract.winmd&lt;/HintPath&gt;\r\n      &lt;IsWinMDFile&gt;true&lt;/IsWinMDFile&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Reference&gt;\r\n\r\nso I could call this in my WPF App.xaml.cs file:\r\n\r\n    using test = Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInstance;\r\n    ...\r\n    Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.IActivatedEventArgs args = test.GetActivatedEventArgs();\r\n\r\nBut after doing this, args are null. Any ideas how to solve this and actually pass arguments to my WPF app?

Remember that your action returns an object with properties `type` and `payload`. When you pass it to your reducer to update the state, you need to look into `action.payload` to access the data that was sent in the action.\r\n\r\nFor example, you might want your reducer to look more like this:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst INIT_STATE = {\r\n    responseData: &#39;&#39;\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  export default (state = INIT_STATE, action) =&gt;

What is the `_` getting inferred to and why has the behaviour changed?\r\n\r\nEach time you do a raw pointer cast, you can only change one piece of information (reference or raw pointer; mutability; type). Therefore, if you do this cast:\r\n\r\n    let ptr = &amp;foo as *const _\r\n\r\nsince you&#39;ve changed from a reference to a raw pointer, the type inferred for `_` _must_ be unchanged and is therefore the type of `foo`, which is some inexpressible type for the function `foo`.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that, you can directly cast to a function pointer, which is expressible in Rust syntax:\r\n\r\n    let ptr = foo as *const fn() as *const c_void;\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for why it has changed, that&#39;s hard to say.

For this reason, an instance of the function item type does not need to store any information at all – what function it points to is clear from its type. So the variable x in \r\n\r\n    let x = foo;\r\n\r\nis a variable of size 0.\r\n\r\nFunction item types implicitly coerce to _function pointer types_ where necessary. The variable\r\n\r\n    let x: fn() = foo;\r\n\r\nis a generic pointer to _any_ function with signature `fn()`, and thus needs to store a pointer to the function it actually points to, so the size of `x` is the size of a pointer.\r\n\r\nIf you take the address of a function, `&amp;foo`, you are actually taking the address of a zero-sized temporary value. Before [this commit to the `rust` repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ea52be482ab4945fda63cb65b6a198309a041e3c), zero-sized temporaries used to create an allocation on the stack, and `&amp;foo` returned the address of that allocation. Since this commit, zero-sized types don&#39;t create allocations anymore, and instead use the magic address 1. This explains the difference between the different versions of Rust.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416511/casting-a-function-reference-producing-an-invalid-pointer/58439378#58439378","title":"Casting a function reference producing an invalid pointer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":552,"user_id":1219515,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64ce0ac7d44d2076d23b21ac62214970?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Maciej Goszczycki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1219515/maciej-goszczycki"},"last_editor":{"reputation":184439,"user_id":155423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/419218774d04a581476ea1887a0921e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shepmaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/155423/shepmaster"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":142,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"accepted_answer_id":58439378,"answer_count":2,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1571339845,"creation_date":1571238568,"last_edit_date":1571239661,"question_id":58416511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416511","body_markdown":"I&#39;m tracking down an error in third party code and I narrowed it down to something along the lines of.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse libc::c_void;\r\n\r\npub unsafe fn foo() {}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let ptr = &amp;foo as *const _ as *const c_void;\r\n    println!(&quot;{:x}&quot;, ptr as usize);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRan on stable 1.38.0 this prints the function pointer, but beta (1.39.0-beta.6) and nightly return &#39;1&#39;.

A way could be to try to apply the algorithm by considering the dependencies in all the possible orders, and the left part of the dependencies in all the possible orders, but this of course is an exponential process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416504/how-to-find-number-of-minimal-covers/58428558#58428558","title":"How to find number of minimal covers?"}],"owner":{"reputation":135,"user_id":6620886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512eac7f669d64cad36f37e0c8c67cba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mahesh Rao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6620886/mahesh-rao"},"last_editor":{"reputation":135,"user_id":6620886,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512eac7f669d64cad36f37e0c8c67cba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mahesh Rao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6620886/mahesh-rao"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571311823,"creation_date":1571238544,"last_edit_date":1571311823,"question_id":58416504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416504","body_markdown":"&gt; Consider R(A, B, C, D, E, F, G) be a relational schema with the\r\n&gt; following functional dependencies: AC → G, D → EG, BC → D, CG → BD,\r\n&gt; ACD → B, CE → AF.&lt;br/&gt; The number of different minimal cover possible\r\n&gt; are\r\n\r\nHow do I go about solving the above question ?\r\n&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nWhat I tried:&lt;br/&gt;--------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;\r\nMy approach to find the number of possible minimal covers was to first use the algorithm (given below) and find the different ways I could find the minimal cover by running through the algorithm (hence giving the number of possible minimum covers). The problem is that I&#39;m not sure how I should consider &quot;a different way to find a minimal cover&quot;.

Say if I do replace ACD → B with AC → B or CD → B, I&#39;m not sure if replacing ACD → B with AC → B could lead to one possible minimal cover and replacing ACD → B with CD → B could lead to another possible minimal cover.\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br/&gt;\r\n**Note**: &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n - &quot;The number of different minimal cover possible&quot; denotes the minimal covers that are possible, given the above relation and functional dependencies.\r\n - Assume that all functional dependencies mentioned in the question are all that hold.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416504/how-to-find-number-of-minimal-covers","title":"How to find number of minimal covers?"},{"tags":["javascript","fetch"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24341,"user_id":269970,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Breov.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"esqew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/269970/esqew"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571238684,"post_id":58416503,"comment_id":103175931,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416503/how-to-use-fetch-without-a-server#comment103175931_58416503"},{"owner":{"reputation":3380,"user_id":3662110,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDJ9n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmargolisvt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3662110/jmargolisvt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238716,"post_id":58416503,"comment_id":103175950,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416503/how-to-use-fetch-without-a-server#comment103175950_58416503"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":7628668,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4_Ybf9imdOA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAtzI/x7aFGtQojBY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"AJD Ajay Dubey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7628668/ajd-ajay-dubey"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571238538,"creation_date":1571238538,"question_id":58416503,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416503","body_markdown":"when I&#39;m using the lite-server npm module the fetch function works but not when i open the html file itself directly\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried giving it the direct path of the JSON file.\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    fetchData() {\r\n        console.log(&quot;fetchData function is running&quot;);\r\n        fetch(&#39;tamogatchiData.json&#39;)\r\n            .then(data =&gt; data.json())\r\n            .then(data =&gt; {\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect to check if the setup is ran on a server or offline then dynamically change the http/https request to a direct path.

Unlike AJAX calls (like the ones that you attempted to make using axios), form submits cause the browser to load a new page, hence all your JS context is lost. \n\nHtml forms have an `action`, which is the URL where the request is executed, and a `method`, which is the HTTP method used to do the request. The `action` is by default the current URL, whereas the `method` is by default `GET` (can also be `POST`).\n\nThese forms can be used to send data with the request. These values are taken from the input fields inside the `form` tag. With a `GET` form submit, the data is sent via URL parameters. Each parameter name is taken from the `name` attribute of each contained input field.\n\nAll this explains why your app reloads the page when you click the button, because the form is submitted, causing a GET request on the / URL, with the username and password parameters in the URL. The `onClick` event is never triggered, so the `login` function is never called, because the page is being reloaded (so the JS context is gone).\n\nTo prevent this, simply change the button type from `submit` to `button` or do a [`preventDefault`][1] call on the event object received in the `onClick` event.\n\n\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416502/react-typescript-log-in-doesnt-send-request-but-re-renders-main-component/58430467#58430467","title":"React Typescript Log in doesn&#39;t send request but re renders main component"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12227372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eea05573a91c246c629db41288e18eaa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martzu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227372/martzu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58430467,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571308230,"creation_date":1571238533,"question_id":58416502,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416502","body_markdown":"I got a problem in react.

I have had a similar issue, and these days want to create as small of builds as possible.\r\n\r\nI constructed a quick test using [source-map-explorer][1] - a simple tool to analyze after you run a build on your project (e.g. Angular, React).  While this tool can be very useful for analyzing what is in your bundles, keep in mind it is minified (as your build process would do) but not gzipped.  Thus it is not what your users would experience, assuming you are on a good host using mod_deflate or a server with similar gzip/Brotli/etc compression.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I did to test using a popular library: React.  I followed instructions using create-react-app then created several variants and build them using `yarn run build`.\r\n\r\n * Test 0: create-react-app (non-typescript)\r\n * Test 1: added lodash via `import * as _ from &#39;lodash&#39;`\r\n * Test 2: removed lodash, added lodash-es and did `import { upperCase } from &#39;lodash-es&#39;`\r\n * Test 3: removed lodash-es, added back in lodash and did `import { upperCase } from &#39;lodash&#39;`\r\n\r\nAfter the build process, I did a command line gzip to get the approximate &quot;web user&quot; gzip size. `gzip *.js` from the build output directory.\r\n\r\nMy results? Well, the runtime-main does not vary at all. The main varies slightly with different text, such as calling the included function to ensure upperCase is actually &quot;baked in&quot; to the build and not just discarded. I&#39;m not concerned about those sizes so will ignore that.\r\n\r\nThus I&#39;ll summarize using the chunk.js.gz size (full results below):\r\n\r\n * Test 0: 41177 bytes (baseline)\r\n * Test 1: 65540 bytes (+24363 bytes to use one function, ouch!)\r\n * Test 2: 43203 bytes (+2026 bytes to use one function - *much better*!)\r\n * Test 3: 65540 bytes (+24363 bytes again, still hurts)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion?  Use lodash-es for granular importing.  Also, for code clarity, and not overriding other function names such as map, I have settled on this strategy:\r\n\r\n`import { map as _map, get as _get } from &#39;lodash-es&#39;`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDirectory and file sizes thanks to `tree --du`\r\n\r\n├── [ 42787] cra-default-test-0\r\n│ ├── [ 41177] 2.284b2af8.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 642] main.a1384886.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 67174] cra-all-lodash-test-1\r\n│ ├── [ 65540] 2.ef604131.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 666] main.c259429e.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 44845] cra-lodash-es-uppercase-only-test-2\r\n│ ├── [ 43203] 2.2852311b.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 674] main.131e67d8.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 67188] cra-lodash-uppercase-only-test-3\r\n│ ├── [ 65540] 2.0ccbb0bd.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 680] main.c3d7426c.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416495/how-to-import-lodash-for-smallest-build-sizes/58416708#58416708","title":"How To Import Lodash for Smallest Build Sizes"}],"owner":{"reputation":21095,"user_id":870729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/742ce6130a9b48676e57e2c38f8a2764?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"random_user_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870729/random-user-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416708,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571239183,"creation_date":1571238505,"question_id":58416495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416495","body_markdown":"I care about my javascript app build sizes.

}}]\r\n    \r\n    with db[COLLECTION].watch(pipeline=pipeline) as stream:\r\n\r\n        for insert_change in stream:\r\n            print(&#39;NEW INCOMING==== \\n&#39;)\r\n            check_previous(insert_change[&#39;fullDocument&#39;])\r\n\r\nexcept pymongo.errors.PyMongoError:\r\n    print(&#39;....&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `check_previous` is as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check_previous(incoming_doc):\r\n    # Find the recent document based on the `location` key and sort them\r\n    # to get the most recent ones\r\n\r\n    prev = db[COLLECTION].find({&#39;location&#39;: {&#39;id&#39;: incoming_doc[&#39;location&#39;][&#39;id&#39;]}})\r\n     .limit(2)\r\n     .sort([(&quot;eventTime&quot;, DESCENDING)])\r\n\r\n     for pre_event in list(prev):\r\n         # An Array of two events\r\n         print(&#39;Previous Event Time: {}&#39;.format(pre_event[1][&#39;eventTime&#39;]))\r\n         print(&#39;Recent Event Time: {}&#39;.format(incoming_doc[&#39;eventTime&#39;])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `find` provides me the documents that are related to the incoming documents `location` key and I have to sort them in __Descending__ order of the event time in order to obtain the last two (recent) documents.\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting the `limit` to 2 is that I assume Change Streams not only notifies the for the incoming INSERT but also simultaneously inserts the data into MongoDB.\r\n\r\nI tried using `limit(1)` and the values of the `eventTime` are the same values meaning that the `incoming_doc` is inserted at the time of Change Stream INSERT Detection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a Specific API for obtaining the data that was previously within the DB before the change stream insertion or the method I am using is the only possible way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416473/obtain-the-previous-document-before-change-stream-inserts-the-new-one-in-mongodb","title":"Obtain the previous document before change stream inserts the new one in MongoDB pymongo"},{"tags":["ios","swift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6131,"user_id":5318223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be47da4995eb4e8dff0ab4637e5773d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kiril S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5318223/kiril-s"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571238750,"post_id":58416472,"comment_id":103175967,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416472/convert-an-object-to-nsdata-for-userdefaults#comment103175967_58416472"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":2603522,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4001e599fcd454ef7fdd48b17de54d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Kachlon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2603522/david-kachlon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571238883,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571238733,"creation_date":1571238399,"question_id":58416472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416472","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve tried this answer on StackOverflow\r\n\r\nOne:\r\n\r\n    UserDefaults.standard.set(NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: [MadBank()]), forKey: &quot;AllBanks&quot;)\r\n              \r\nThis gives me the error:\r\n\r\n     reason: &#39;-[madbank.MadBank encodeWithCoder:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x6000030ef440&#39;\r\n\r\nSo please don&#39;t mark this is a duplicate, as every one of the results I&#39;ve found with this same error does *NOT* resolve my issue.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing I need to convert my MadBank() object to NSData.

Like :\r\n\r\nGet `user` from model :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = await User.find(1) //1 = id\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet `user` model from `auth` object :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = auth.user\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Switch authentication - [documentation][1]**\r\n```js\r\nconst user = auth.user\r\n\r\nconst token = const auth\r\n  .authenticator(&#39;jwt&#39;)\r\n  .generate(user)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JWT authentication\r\ncreate token (from `User` model) :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = await User.find(1)//id = 1\r\n\r\nconst token await auth.generate(user)\r\n```\r\n*Now with the token it is possible to log in by putting it in the header of the query (REST concept)*\r\n\r\ncheck token :\r\n```js\r\ntry {\r\n  await auth.check()\r\n} catch (error) {\r\n  response.send(&#39;Missing or invalid jwt token&#39;)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[I have some examples of authentication middleware (JWT)][2] \r\n\r\n### Official documentation\r\n- [JWT Auth][3] \r\n- [Session Auth][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_switching_authenticators\r\n  [2]: https://gitlab.com/CrBast/website/tree/develop/website/app/Middleware\r\n  [3]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_jwt\r\n  [4]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_session","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416430/custom-login-in-adonisjs-not-work-loginviaid/58421061#58421061","title":"custom login in adonisjs (not work loginViaId)"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":11620681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEaHo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MohammadReza Abbasi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11620681/mohammadreza-abbasi"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571301088,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571291253,"creation_date":1571238270,"question_id":58416430,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416430","body_markdown":"I couldn&#39;t find a way to manually log in to a restapi app\r\n\r\nHelp me please\r\n\r\nnot work loginViaId , is only in &#39;session&#39;\r\n```\r\nauth.loginViaId(1)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416430/custom-login-in-adonisjs-not-work-loginviaid","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"custom login in adonisjs (not work loginViaId)"},{"tags":["python","pandas","geolocation","filtering"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":11901353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eOScFFEgaac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczRafc8tRO20YE8iwB5RvpYQt89w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mamed Mamedov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901353/mamed-mamedov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238647,"post_id":58416481,"comment_id":103175909,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416423/filter-points-between-polygons/58416481#comment103175909_58416481"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":11827280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17b5b8cf7bd6da7fb71f70b94898a405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dcacat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11827280/dcacat"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":54,"user_id":11901353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eOScFFEgaac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczRafc8tRO20YE8iwB5RvpYQt89w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mamed Mamedov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901353/mamed-mamedov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571241513,"post_id":58416481,"comment_id":103177475,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416423/filter-points-between-polygons/58416481#comment103177475_58416481"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":11827280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17b5b8cf7bd6da7fb71f70b94898a405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dcacat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11827280/dcacat"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571238442,"creation_date":1571238442,"answer_id":58416481,"question_id":58416423,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416481","body_markdown":"What does your polygon data look like?

have not scan through the `JLS` as you have asked in your question, so please take this answer with a grain of salt. I wanted to make it a comment, but it would have been too big.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI find funny at times, how `javac` is pretty &quot;smart&quot; in some cases (like in your case), but leaves a lot of other things to be handled later by `JIT`. In this case, it is just that the compiler &quot;can tell&quot; that only a `RuntimeException` would be caught. This is obvious, it&#39;s the only thing you throw in `doSomething`. If you slightly change your code to:\r\n\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            Exception ex2 = new Exception();\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nyou will see a different behavior, because now `javac` can tell that there is a new `Exception` that you are throwing, un-related to the one you caught.\r\n\r\nBut things are far from ideal, you can &quot;trick&quot; the compiler yet again via:\r\n\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            Exception ex2 = new Exception();\r\n            ex2 = ex;\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIMO, because of `ex2 = ex;` it should not fail again, but it does.  \r\n\r\nJust in case this was compiled with `javac 13+33`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416402/catching-an-exception-and-rethrowing-it-but-its-not-an-exception/58438255#58438255","title":"Catching an Exception and rethrowing it, but it&#39;s not an Exception"}],"owner":{"reputation":11197,"user_id":1310566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3xuh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Forsberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1310566/simon-forsberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11197,"user_id":1310566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3xuh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Forsberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1310566/simon-forsberg"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":10,"answer_count":1,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1571334888,"creation_date":1571238197,"last_edit_date":1571238435,"question_id":58416402,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416402","body_markdown":"I stumbled upon code looking something like this:\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis code surprises me because it looks like the `run()`-method is capable of throwing an `Exception`, since it catches `Exception` and then rethrows it, but the method is not declared to throw `Exception` and apparently doesn&#39;t need to be.

I want to simply add to this existing dashboard.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  AutoScalingDashboardMetrics:\r\n    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard\r\n    Properties: \r\n      DashboardBody: !Sub |\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;start&quot;: &quot;-PT9H&quot;,\r\n          &quot;periodOverride&quot;: &quot;inherit&quot;,\r\n          &quot;widgets&quot;: [\r\n              {\r\n                &quot;type&quot;:&quot;metric&quot;,\r\n                &quot;properties&quot;:{\r\n                    &quot;metrics&quot;: [\r\n                        [ &quot;AWS/AutoScaling&quot;, &quot;GroupTotalInstances&quot;, &quot;AutoScalingGroupName&quot;, &quot;${AWS::StackName}&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ],\r\n                        [ &quot;.&quot;, &quot;GroupStandbyInstances&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ],\r\n                        [ &quot;.&quot;, &quot;GroupDesiredCapacity&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ]\r\n                    ],\r\n                    &quot;view&quot;: &quot;timeSeries&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;stacked&quot;: false,\r\n                    &quot;region&quot;: &quot;{AWS::Region}&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ASG Instances: ${AWS::StackName}&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;period&quot;: 300\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      DashboardName: test\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416401/how-do-i-add-a-widget-to-an-existing-dashboard-in-aws","title":"How Do I add a widget to an existing dashboard in AWS?"},{"tags":["node.js","amazon-web-services","authorization","aws-api-gateway","amazon-cognito"],"owner":{"reputation":7927,"user_id":491553,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gh31e.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan Shillington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/491553/ryan-shillington"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571238183,"creation_date":1571238183,"question_id":58416398,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416398","body_markdown":"I have a custom authorizer for AWS Cognito using Node JS in Lambda and it works great.  It&#39;s basically using the code provided in [this tutorial][1].\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways my custom authorizer can fail: the user is using the wrong pool, the user submitted an invalid authorization token, etc.  Whenever this happens, I call:\r\n\r\n          context.fail(&quot;Unauthorized&quot;);\r\n\r\nand that works well too. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the user&#39;s token has expired (which happens all the time, especially first thing in the morning if somebody left their browser open), I also call that same method, which is the only way I know of to return a 401 message.  This works and the user is returned back to the login page.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in my Cloudwatch dashboard, where we&#39;re monitoring for broken code / suspicious activity, every time somebody leaves their browser open we see a Lambda error.  This is very noisy and makes it hard to catch somebody doing something suspicious.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSo my question: How can I fail the authorizer, return a 401 (or something else), not have the REST API execute and also NOT have an error show up in CloudWatch?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

It has to be in place before the config files are read.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416384/spring-boot-not-loading-default-profile-while-using-spring-profile-default-in-ap","title":"spring boot not loading default profile while using spring.profile.default in application.properties"},{"tags":["symfony","translators"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3752927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0d8aad08c87abac3043cf23f85cb3c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexglvr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3752927/alexglvr"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571306796,"post_id":58416607,"comment_id":103200782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#comment103200782_58416607"},{"owner":{"reputation":266,"user_id":8934481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRTgT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nobady","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8934481/nobady"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3752927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0d8aad08c87abac3043cf23f85cb3c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexglvr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3752927/alexglvr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571308790,"post_id":58416607,"comment_id":103201950,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#comment103201950_58416607"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":266,"user_id":8934481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRTgT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nobady","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8934481/nobady"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571238846,"creation_date":1571238846,"answer_id":58416607,"question_id":58416383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416607","body_markdown":"to manage the translation in twig there is the appropriate trans function (example):\r\n\r\n    &lt;label for=&quot;inputUsername&quot; class=&quot;sr-only&quot;&gt;{{&#39;username&#39; | trans}}&lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nand in your messages.fr.yml add:\r\n\r\nusername: &quot;Nom d&#39;utilisateur&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#58416607","title":"symfony &amp; translation : How to translate standard expressions &amp; forms?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571315282,"creation_date":1571315282,"answer_id":58432671,"question_id":58416383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58432671","body_markdown":"The default for form labels is to use a [&quot;humanized&quot;][1] version.

If not in the path, and you cache responses and multiple players can use the same client, then you need to look at making use of the HTTP Vary header to avoid one player getting another player&#39;s profile (from cache).\r\n\r\n3. I agree with the comment about API discoverability. If the back-end is telling the front-end what are the URLs via &quot;links&quot; (e.g. See HAL for an approach), then there is no concern about the &quot;design of the js client&quot;. The expectation is that the client gets the links from the service. I.e. &quot;If you want to get the player&#39;s profile, here is the link you use&quot;.\r\n\r\n4. If the expectation is that the id is not in the path, then it&#39;s better for the service to control that, by putting the id in a cookie, for example, so that it is certain to get it back in subsequent requests and the client doesn&#39;t even need to know.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416370/rest-api-design-url-design/58416818#58416818","title":"rest api design URL design"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26282,"user_id":54734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea91774321962f70f19362f43568cda9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VoiceOfUnreason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/54734/voiceofunreason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571244707,"creation_date":1571244707,"answer_id":58418186,"question_id":58416370,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418186","body_markdown":"&gt; How do you think the rest api of the backend server should look like and why ? \r\n\r\nAre you expecting caching to work?\r\n\r\n`api/players/{playerID}/profile` is easily cached; general purpose components expect to use the URI as a cache key, with which they will store and retrieve the document.

Anyone who obtains commit *C* acquires branch *B*.  If they had *their own* branch *B* before, well, now *their* branch *B* has a new commit *C* in it.\r\n\r\nGit *does not* do this.  Commits are not permanently tacked to branches.  However, commits *are* mostly permanent,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and permanently tacked to where they appear in the *commit graph*.  In order to make this work, commits aren&#39;t really made on *any* branches.  Instead, a branch name is merely a label.  Multiple labels can all point to the *same commit*, as in:\r\n\r\n&gt;     *   305f Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; (HEAD-&gt;master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\r\n\r\nHere `master` and `origin/master`&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; both identify commit `305f`.  If you create a new branch `br2` now, that name will *also* point to commit `305f`.\r\n\r\nCommit `305f` has *two* parents: `7a761b6` (its first parent) and `d97b` (its second parent).  The full name of `305f` is whatever its full hash ID is.  This will never change; and that hash ID is forever reserved for *that* commit, which will always have the same two parents.  That commit is frozen for all time and will never move.\r\n\r\nThe things in Git that *do* move are the *branch names*.  Currently, `master` means `305f`.  A moment ago, however, `master` meant `7a761b6`.  Commits stay in place, forever, as found by their raw hash IDs.  Branch names move about.\r\n\r\nThe result of all of this is that the set of branches that contain some commit changes, dynamically, as we create and destroy branch names.  At this time, the name `master` lets you find all four commits.  If you allow Git to move the name `master` in the ways that Git prefers, those four commits will continue to be reachable, by starting at `305f` and viewing both of its parents, then viewing the parent of `d97b` (and then from `d97b` you get back to `7a761b6` which you already saw).  Note that *new* commits only ever *add to the graph*.  In general, each new commit will have some existing commit as its parent—its only parent if it&#39;s a typical commit, or one of two parents if it&#39;s a merge commit.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nIf we draw these things sideways, it&#39;s a little easier.  To make it even easier than that, we can use single uppercase letters to stand in for the incomprehensible hash IDs that Git uses:\r\n\r\n            D--E   &lt;-- br1\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nHere, the name `br1` allows us to find commit `E`, which finds `D`, then `C`, then `B`, then `A` (and stops because `A` is the first commit).  The name `br2` allows us to find `G`, then `F`, then `C`, then `B`, then `A` (and then stop).  So the first three commits are on *both* branches, while two commits are each only one one branch.\r\n\r\nErasing the *name* `br1` causes commits `D` and `E` to become unfindable.  Eventually Git will throw them out for real.  If we instead add a new commit by doing `git checkout br1`, make whatever changes we want, `git add`, and `git commit`, we get a new hash ID `H` and advance the name `br1` to include it:\r\n\r\n            D--E--H   &lt;-- br1\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nNow there are six commits reachable from `br1`, starting with `H` and working backwards.  If we make a new name `br3` to remember where `E` is, we&#39;ll want to redraw the graph a bit:\r\n\r\n                 H   &lt;-- br2\r\n                /\r\n            D--E   &lt;-- br3\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nNote that none of the *commits* have actually changed: we just shoved `H` up to make room for the label `br3`.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the *name* `br3` later, that&#39;s OK: there are no commits that are *exlusively* found through `br3`.  Commit `E` won&#39;t go away because `br1` finds `H` which finds `E`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The *mostly* comes about through *reachability*.  You *find* commits by starting from some branch or tag name, which supplies a raw hash ID.  Then, having found a commit, you use its parent hash ID(s) to find its predecessor commit(s).  Then you use *those* commits to find *their* parents, and so on.\r\n\r\nBy doing this process from *every* reference—see footnote 2—Git finds all *reachable* commits.  Any commits that exist in the repository, that are not reaachable by this process, eventually get garbage-collected and removed.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The name `master` is a branch name.  Its full name is really `refs/heads/master`, and names whose full name starts with `refs/heads/` are branch names.  By contrast, `origin/master` is actually a *remote-tracking* name: its full name starts with `refs/remotes/` and then goes on to say `origin/master`.  Git sometimes strips only the `refs/` part from this name, so that you see `remotes/origin/master`.\r\n\r\nTags, if you have any, live in `refs/tags/`.  These things are collectively called *refs* or *references*.  There are additional, hidden references kept in *reflogs*.  A reflog is simply a log file keeping the values—the previous hash IDs—that were stored in a ref before you, or Git, updated it.  These reflog entries eventually expire, which is how deliberately-abandoned commits—those you&#39;ve replaced with new-and-improved versions that have new hash IDs, for instance—are eventually cleaned out.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;The technical definition of a *merge commit* is that it is one with at least two parents.  You can therefore create a merge commit with 3 or more parents, too—but there&#39;s rarely a reason to do that.  I should also mention that it&#39;s possible to create a new commit with *no* parent.  Except for the very first commit—the one I label `A` in the sideways graph drawings—you won&#39;t do that in normal practice either.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416362/why-are-git-commits-on-a-merged-branch-showing-on-my-main-branch/58417829#58417829","title":"Why are git commits on a merged branch showing on my main branch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3024,"user_id":2874789,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKbXD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christopher Shroba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2874789/christopher-shroba"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58417829,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571243154,"creation_date":1571238073,"question_id":58416362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416362","body_markdown":"I currently have a git commit tree that looks something like this with pointers (?) in parentheses:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   305f Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; (HEAD-&gt;master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\r\n|\\\r\n| * d97b Some other commit on dev branch (develop) \r\n| * df14 Some commit on dev branch\r\n|/\r\n* 7a761b6 Initial commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve pushed master branch to remote (Gitlab, if it matters), and when I look at the commits on the master branch in the Gitlab UI, all 4 commits are present, where I would have expected only the &quot;Merge branch &#39;develop&#39;&quot; and &quot;Initial commit&quot; commits to be present on the master branch.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that `master` refers to the two commits I just listed, whereas `develop` refers to &quot;Some other...&quot; , &quot;Some commit...&quot;, and possibly &quot;Initial commit&quot; as well, since it is an ancestor.\r\n\r\nWhere am I going wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416362/why-are-git-commits-on-a-merged-branch-showing-on-my-main-branch","title":"Why are git commits on a merged branch showing on my main branch?"},{"tags":["python","selenium","openpyxl"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":933,"user_id":5226792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/khMGh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wonka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5226792/wonka"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571238258,"creation_date":1571238258,"answer_id":58416428,"question_id":58416360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416428","body_markdown":"You have to save en excel the content?

Some of the XML contains attributes, which show ```@attributes``` in the output. Somehow, I tried to ```console.log()``` the ```@attributes``` but failed. Here is the detail:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In front-end, using JQuery AJAX, I send HTTP request to one of my PHP file.\r\n\r\n2. In back-end PHP, I retrieve data from DB where one of the column contains String of XML.\r\n\r\n3. Then, after retrieving, I used ```simplexml_load_string()``` function to convert the String of XML into true XML.\r\n\r\n4. Here is the example of String of XML:\r\n```\r\n&lt;dsconnector&gt;\r\n    &lt;statement&gt;\r\n        SELECT SUM(a.doc_amt) FROM gl_temp_trx_dt as a INNER JOIN gl_temp_trx_hd as b ON a.gl_hd_unique_id = b.unique_id\r\n    &lt;/statement&gt;\r\n    &lt;filter id=&quot;company123&quot; range=&quot;false&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Company&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;table&gt;company&lt;/table&gt;\r\n        &lt;field&gt;company_code&lt;/field&gt;\r\n        &lt;alias&gt;a&lt;/alias&gt;\r\n        &lt;desc&gt;company_name&lt;/desc&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependee&gt;glacc, glyear, glperiod&lt;/dependee&gt;\r\n    &lt;/filter&gt;\r\n&lt;/dsconnector&gt;\r\n```\r\nNotice that ```&lt;filter&gt;``` has two attributes\r\n\r\n5. After that, I used ```json_encode()``` function to output the converted XML\r\n\r\n6. In front-end, I used ```console.log()``` function to see what the output looks like, and here is part of the result:\r\n```\r\n0: {…}\r\n  &quot;@attributes&quot;: {…}\r\n     id: &quot;companyFilterId&quot;\r\n     range: &quot;false&quot;\r\n     &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { … }\r\n  alias: &quot;ar&quot;\r\n  dependee: &quot;projectFilterId_0123, phaseFilterId_ABCD, debtorAccFilterId&quot;\r\n  desc: &quot;company_name&quot;\r\n  field: &quot;company_code&quot;\r\n  label: &quot;Company&quot;\r\n  table: &quot;company&quot;\r\n  &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { … }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. As you can see, the attributes part contains &quot;@&quot;. And by using this code to print the result:\r\n```\r\n...[other AJAX part]...\r\nsuccess: function(data, textStatus, XMLHttpRequest)\r\n         {\r\n               if (data.status==1)\r\n               {\r\n                  console.log(data.result[0].attributes);\r\n               }\r\n                  else if(data.status==0)\r\n               {\r\n\r\n               }\r\n         },\r\n...[other AJAX part]...\r\n```\r\nIt will say that that the ```attributes``` is undefined.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy question is, how to display the JSON Array that the object named contains &quot;@&quot;.

I&#39;m not having difficulty fetching the data and sending it to the template for rendering.  The difficult is that I need to loop through the records and build them into an HTML string in order to support the display we need.  Prior to building them into a string, I need to run a function on the text of each template which will replace some codes with values from the database.\r\n\r\nIn sequential code, skeleton code might look like:\r\n\r\n    template_recs = get_template_recs(user_id)\r\n    \r\n    for each template_rec\r\n    \r\n      template_text = template_rec.text\r\n    \r\n      template_text_new = replace_codes(template_text, user_id)\r\n    \r\n      template_text_new_html = (html_start + template_text_new + html_end)\r\n    \r\n      template_options_html = (template_options_html + template_text_new_html)\r\n    \r\n    next\r\n    \r\n    display template_options_html\r\n\r\nOf course, I would like to develop this in an async way, where the html is wrapped around the template_text after it gets the codes replaced and the display of the entire html occurs after all of the records have been added to the html variable.\r\n\r\nI wrote the code below but it&#39;s not working.  Before I delve into correcting it, my question is whether this is the best way to go about this.

For smallish result sets, you probably want to restrict the customers first and then find the matching orders.  This approach suggsts indexes on:\r\n\r\n - `customers(location, industry, customer_id, EarliestActiveOrder, LatestActiveOrder)`\r\n - `orders(customer_id, startdate)`\r\n\r\nIf you had other columns for filtering, you would need separate indexes for them.  For instance, for `industry`-only filtering:\r\n\r\n - `customers(industry, customer_id, EarliestActiveOrder, LatestActiveOrder)`\r\n\r\nThis can get cumbersome.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, your result set is likely to be a significant number of orders, then scanning the `orders` table might be more efficient.  You can try to rely on the optimizer.  Or just push it in the right direction by phrasing the query as:\r\n\r\n    select o.*\r\n    from orders o\r\n    where exists (select 1\r\n                  from customers c\r\n                  where o.Customer_id = c.Customer_id and\r\n                        o.StartDate between c.EarliestActiveOrder  and c.LatestActiveOrder and\r\n                        c.Location = &#39;New York&#39; and c.industry = &#39;Finance&#39;\r\n                 );\r\n\r\nIn this case, you want an index on `customers(customer_id)` -- but that is probably already the primary key so you are fine.  This has the advantage that you don&#39;t need to worry about the exact filtering criteria.  The downside is a full table scan on `orders` (but not additional work for a `join`, `group by`, or `order by`).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416340/sql-server-table-join-based-on-record-dependent-values/58416982#58416982","title":"SQL Server: table join based on record-dependent values"}],"owner":{"reputation":250,"user_id":4789843,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b0345992a82b453ff9e68376fd3f791?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"deseosuho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4789843/deseosuho"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416387,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571593317,"creation_date":1571237992,"last_edit_date":1571593317,"question_id":58416340,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416340","body_markdown":"There&#39;s a general type of query I&#39;m trying to perform, and I&#39;m not sure how to express it in words so that I can find a discussion of best practices and examples for executing it.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example use case.  \r\n\r\nI have a `customers` table that has info about customers and an `orders` table.

When one hover on the list, the map icon opens. This is the way many popular maps work. The user hovers on the list item and the map changes color or an info window pops open. Take gmaps for example: \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nBut the way I have this setup in React currently just isn&#39;t working. So I have a parent list:\r\n\r\n        &lt;div className={classes.parentList}&gt;\r\n      {filtereditems.map((item, index) =&gt; (\r\n        &lt;ShowCard\r\n          key={index}\r\n          item={item}\r\n          setCardMarkerHover={this.setCardMarkerHover}\r\n          resetCardMarkerHover={this.resetCardMarkerHover}\r\n        /&gt;\r\n      ))}\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;;\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, within my List items, I call the prop functions like so\r\n\r\n    onMouseEnter={e =&gt; props.setCardMarkerHover(item.node.id)}\r\n    onMouseLeave={e =&gt; props.resetCardMarkerHover()}\r\n\r\nThese functions `setCardMarkerHover` and `resetCardMarkerHover` call setState, which then rerenders everything(!) so that my map markers change. The infowindow pops open on the right marker.\r\n\r\nHere are the functions:\r\n\r\n\r\n      setCardMarkerHover = id =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n          hoveredCardId: id,\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      resetCardMarkerHover = () =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n          hoveredCardId: &quot;&quot;,\r\n        })\r\n      }\r\n\r\n`hoveredCardId` then gets passed to the Map and Markers (pins), and they change according to whether that marker matches the same index/id for the list items being hovered.\r\n\r\nThe challenge, as you can likely imagine, is that this really bogs my list down. It no longer scrolls smoothly because so many parts of the DOM are having to repaint/rerender as the mouse enters and exits the different list items.\r\n\r\nReact-virtualized solves this problem through `windowing` but this seems like extreme overkill.\r\n\r\nWhat would another way to be able to hover on a child list item and have it change something else in another child component without triggering so much repainting?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

How would I best approach this?\r\n\r\nThis is what I&#39;m doing:\r\nI am creating a search page to display results from my database of events. It works fine and sorts and filters according to the criteria I have. I want to add the ability to filter by category as well. Each event in my table can have multiple categories. I want to make it so that when I mark that category in my search form, it displays items from that category only.\r\n\r\nTherefore I can check the box &quot;Category ID 24&quot; in my search and filter form and it will output events like\r\n```\r\nEVENT: Magic Show\r\nWhen: Oct 9th, 2:00pm\r\nCategories: 24, 32, 15\r\n```\r\nsince Category 24 was one of the categories for this event.\r\n\r\n\r\nRight now I have it &quot;working&quot; by taking each result and doing a second SQL call to check to see if it belongs to that category, which is resource-intensive but effective. I also got a &quot;better&quot; version working where it checks against a string of category ids and decides whether to show it. Effective, but still not proper code.\r\n\r\nWhat makes this difficult are my tables. I have a table Events, which contain information about each event, a table Categories, which lists all possible categories, and one called EventCategories which assigns each eventID to a categoryID, one per row.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my SQL:\r\n```\r\nSELECT \r\n    e.ID, \r\n    e.Title, \r\n    GROUP_CONCAT(c.ID SEPARATOR &#39;  &amp;middot;  &#39;) as Categories\r\nFROM \r\n    Events e\r\n    LEFT JOIN EventCategories ec ON ec.EventID = e.ID \r\n    LEFT JOIN Categories c ON c.ID = ec.CategoryID\r\n\t\r\nWHERE\r\n\t&quot;.$cond.&quot;\r\nORDER BY \r\n    e.Title DESC\r\n```\r\nThe Group Contact works so that when I type $row[&#39;Categories&#39;] it displays something like 23 &#183; 28 &#183; 26. This is great, but I&#39;d need to put this in my WHERE clause to check against these numbers, and that&#39;s where I&#39;m stuck.\r\n\r\nI need to make this so that I can say something like &quot;WHERE all events with category &#39;23&#39;&quot; will display. I&#39;m grabbing the category from the POST data, do that&#39;s not a problem, but the tricky part is writing the WHERE clause for a varied number of categories.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416571/how-can-i-put-multiple-checkbox-results-in-a-where-clause-in-sql","title":"How can I put multiple checkbox results in a WHERE clause

say you have a file of 2GB and you want to place that file in HDFS, then there will be 2GB/128MB = 16 blocks and these block will be distributed across the different DataNodes.\r\n\r\nData splitting happens based on file offsets. The goal of splitting the file and store it into different blocks, is parallel processing and fail over of data.\r\n\r\nSplit is logical split of the data, basically used during data processing using Map/Reduce program or other data-processing techniques in Hadoop. Split size is user defined value and one can choose his own split size based on the volume of data(How much data you are processing).\r\n\r\nSplit is basically used to control number of Mapper in Map/Reduce program. If you have not defined any input split size in Map/Reduce program then default HDFS block split will be considered as input split. (i.e., Input Split = Input Block. So 16 mappers will be triggered for a 2 GB file). If Split size is defined as 100 MB (lets say), then 21 Mappers will be triggered (20 Mappers for 2000MB and 21st Mapper for 48MB).\r\n\r\nHope this clears your doubt.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416551/blocks-in-mapreduce/58418395#58418395","title":"Blocks in Mapreduce"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11847159,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3Y7IuAY5QMY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdzEEVJhsfRNqC3lUA008APKe8bfA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11847159/amr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571253943,"post_id":58418434,"comment_id":103183001,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416551/blocks-in-mapreduce/58418434#comment103183001_58418434"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":3792209,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dmICY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Makubex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3792209/makubex"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571245670,"creation_date":1571245670,"answer_id":58418434,"question_id":58416551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418434","body_markdown":"HDFS stores the file as blocks and each block is 128Mb in size (default).\r\nMapreduce processes this HDFS file.

I published it via Windows Application Packaging Project. Because it&#39;s WPF app, I needed to add this to appxmanifest:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Extensions&gt;\r\n      &lt;uap5:Extension\r\n        Category=&quot;windows.appExecutionAlias&quot;\r\n        Executable=&quot;MyApp.exe&quot;\r\n        EntryPoint=&quot;MyApp&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;uap5:AppExecutionAlias&gt;\r\n          &lt;uap5:ExecutionAlias Alias=&quot;MyApp.exe&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/uap5:AppExecutionAlias&gt;\r\n      &lt;/uap5:Extension&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Extensions&gt;\r\n\r\nThen I published the WPF app as sideloaded and it works just fine when I start it from the Windows Start menu. The problem is that I need to start it from command line and I need to pass few command line arguments. But, when I start the app from command line by typing the alias, it only passes this argument:\r\n-ServerName:App.App7adfdfg54shnsdfh87asrgsdfg1.mca\r\nwhich is not my argument - mine arguments are not passed at all. So then I tried to add this to my WPF .csproj file:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Reference Include=&quot;Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;HintPath&gt;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Windows Kits\\10\\References\\10.0.18362.0\\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract\\8.0.0.0\\Windows.Foundation.UniversalApiContract.winmd&lt;/HintPath&gt;\r\n      &lt;IsWinMDFile&gt;true&lt;/IsWinMDFile&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Reference&gt;\r\n\r\nso I could call this in my WPF App.xaml.cs file:\r\n\r\n    using test = Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInstance;\r\n    ...\r\n    Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.IActivatedEventArgs args = test.GetActivatedEventArgs();\r\n\r\nBut after doing this, args are null. Any ideas how to solve this and actually pass arguments to my WPF app?

What is the `_` getting inferred to and why has the behaviour changed?\r\n\r\nEach time you do a raw pointer cast, you can only change one piece of information (reference or raw pointer; mutability; type). Therefore, if you do this cast:\r\n\r\n    let ptr = &amp;foo as *const _\r\n\r\nsince you&#39;ve changed from a reference to a raw pointer, the type inferred for `_` _must_ be unchanged and is therefore the type of `foo`, which is some inexpressible type for the function `foo`.\r\n\r\nInstead of doing that, you can directly cast to a function pointer, which is expressible in Rust syntax:\r\n\r\n    let ptr = foo as *const fn() as *const c_void;\r\n\r\n\r\nAs for why it has changed, that&#39;s hard to say. It could be a bug in the nightly build.

So the variable x in \r\n\r\n    let x = foo;\r\n\r\nis a variable of size 0.\r\n\r\nFunction item types implicitly coerce to _function pointer types_ where necessary. The variable\r\n\r\n    let x: fn() = foo;\r\n\r\nis a generic pointer to _any_ function with signature `fn()`, and thus needs to store a pointer to the function it actually points to, so the size of `x` is the size of a pointer.\r\n\r\nIf you take the address of a function, `&amp;foo`, you are actually taking the address of a zero-sized temporary value. Before [this commit to the `rust` repo](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/commit/ea52be482ab4945fda63cb65b6a198309a041e3c), zero-sized temporaries used to create an allocation on the stack, and `&amp;foo` returned the address of that allocation. Since this commit, zero-sized types don&#39;t create allocations anymore, and instead use the magic address 1. This explains the difference between the different versions of Rust.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416511/casting-a-function-reference-producing-an-invalid-pointer/58439378#58439378","title":"Casting a function reference producing an invalid pointer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":552,"user_id":1219515,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64ce0ac7d44d2076d23b21ac62214970?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Maciej Goszczycki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1219515/maciej-goszczycki"},"last_editor":{"reputation":184439,"user_id":155423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/419218774d04a581476ea1887a0921e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shepmaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/155423/shepmaster"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":142,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"accepted_answer_id":58439378,"answer_count":2,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1571339845,"creation_date":1571238568,"last_edit_date":1571239661,"question_id":58416511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416511","body_markdown":"I&#39;m tracking down an error in third party code and I narrowed it down to something along the lines of.\r\n\r\n```\r\nuse libc::c_void;\r\n\r\npub unsafe fn foo() {}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let ptr = &amp;foo as *const _ as *const c_void;\r\n    println!(&quot;{:x}&quot;, ptr as usize);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRan on stable 1.38.0 this prints the function pointer, but beta (1.39.0-beta.6) and nightly return &#39;1&#39;.

Unlike AJAX calls (like the ones that you attempted to make using axios), form submits cause the browser to load a new page, hence all your JS context is lost. \n\nHtml forms have an `action`, which is the URL where the request is executed, and a `method`, which is the HTTP method used to do the request. The `action` is by default the current URL, whereas the `method` is by default `GET` (can also be `POST`).\n\nThese forms can be used to send data with the request. These values are taken from the input fields inside the `form` tag. With a `GET` form submit, the data is sent via URL parameters. Each parameter name is taken from the `name` attribute of each contained input field.\n\nAll this explains why your app reloads the page when you click the button, because the form is submitted, causing a GET request on the / URL, with the username and password parameters in the URL. The `onClick` event is never triggered, so the `login` function is never called, because the page is being reloaded (so the JS context is gone).\n\nTo prevent this, simply change the button type from `submit` to `button` or do a [`preventDefault`][1] call on the event object received in the `onClick` event.\n\n\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416502/react-typescript-log-in-doesnt-send-request-but-re-renders-main-component/58430467#58430467","title":"React Typescript Log in doesn&#39;t send request but re renders main component"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12227372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eea05573a91c246c629db41288e18eaa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martzu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227372/martzu"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58430467,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571308230,"creation_date":1571238533,"question_id":58416502,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416502","body_markdown":"I got a problem in react.

I have had a similar issue, and these days want to create as small of builds as possible.\r\n\r\nI constructed a quick test using [source-map-explorer][1] - a simple tool to analyze after you run a build on your project (e.g. Angular, React).  While this tool can be very useful for analyzing what is in your bundles, keep in mind it is minified (as your build process would do) but not gzipped.  Thus it is not what your users would experience, assuming you are on a good host using mod_deflate or a server with similar gzip/Brotli/etc compression.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I did to test using a popular library: React.  I followed instructions using create-react-app then created several variants and build them using `yarn run build`.\r\n\r\n * Test 0: create-react-app (non-typescript)\r\n * Test 1: added lodash via `import * as _ from &#39;lodash&#39;`\r\n * Test 2: removed lodash, added lodash-es and did `import { upperCase } from &#39;lodash-es&#39;`\r\n * Test 3: removed lodash-es, added back in lodash and did `import { upperCase } from &#39;lodash&#39;`\r\n\r\nAfter the build process, I did a command line gzip to get the approximate &quot;web user&quot; gzip size. `gzip *.js` from the build output directory.\r\n\r\nMy results? Well, the runtime-main does not vary at all. The main varies slightly with different text, such as calling the included function to ensure upperCase is actually &quot;baked in&quot; to the build and not just discarded. I&#39;m not concerned about those sizes so will ignore that.\r\n\r\nThus I&#39;ll summarize using the chunk.js.gz size (full results below):\r\n\r\n * Test 0: 41177 bytes (baseline)\r\n * Test 1: 65540 bytes (+24363 bytes to use one function, ouch!)\r\n * Test 2: 43203 bytes (+2026 bytes to use one function - *much better*!)\r\n * Test 3: 65540 bytes (+24363 bytes again, still hurts)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion?  Use lodash-es for granular importing.  Also, for code clarity, and not overriding other function names such as map, I have settled on this strategy:\r\n\r\n`import { map as _map, get as _get } from &#39;lodash-es&#39;`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nDirectory and file sizes thanks to `tree --du`\r\n\r\n├── [ 42787] cra-default-test-0\r\n│ ├── [ 41177] 2.284b2af8.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 642] main.a1384886.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 67174] cra-all-lodash-test-1\r\n│ ├── [ 65540] 2.ef604131.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 666] main.c259429e.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 44845] cra-lodash-es-uppercase-only-test-2\r\n│ ├── [ 43203] 2.2852311b.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 674] main.131e67d8.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n├── [ 67188] cra-lodash-uppercase-only-test-3\r\n│ ├── [ 65540] 2.0ccbb0bd.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ ├── [ 680] main.c3d7426c.chunk.js.gz\r\n│ └── [ 808] runtime-main.3ba3833f.js.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/danvk/source-map-explorer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416495/how-to-import-lodash-for-smallest-build-sizes/58416708#58416708","title":"How To Import Lodash for Smallest Build Sizes"}],"owner":{"reputation":21095,"user_id":870729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/742ce6130a9b48676e57e2c38f8a2764?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"random_user_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870729/random-user-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58416708,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571239183,"creation_date":1571238505,"question_id":58416495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416495","body_markdown":"I care about my javascript app build sizes.

}}]\r\n    \r\n    with db[COLLECTION].watch(pipeline=pipeline) as stream:\r\n\r\n        for insert_change in stream:\r\n            print(&#39;NEW INCOMING==== \\n&#39;)\r\n            check_previous(insert_change[&#39;fullDocument&#39;])\r\n\r\nexcept pymongo.errors.PyMongoError:\r\n    print(&#39;....&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `check_previous` is as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef check_previous(incoming_doc):\r\n    # Find the recent document based on the `location` key and sort them\r\n    # to get the most recent ones\r\n\r\n    prev = db[COLLECTION].find({&#39;location&#39;: {&#39;id&#39;: incoming_doc[&#39;location&#39;][&#39;id&#39;]}})\r\n     .limit(2)\r\n     .sort([(&quot;eventTime&quot;, DESCENDING)])\r\n\r\n     for pre_event in list(prev):\r\n         # An Array of two events\r\n         print(&#39;Previous Event Time: {}&#39;.format(pre_event[1][&#39;eventTime&#39;]))\r\n         print(&#39;Recent Event Time: {}&#39;.format(incoming_doc[&#39;eventTime&#39;])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `find` provides me the documents that are related to the incoming documents `location` key and I have to sort them in __Descending__ order of the event time in order to obtain the last two (recent) documents.\r\n\r\nThe reason for setting the `limit` to 2 is that I assume Change Streams not only notifies the for the incoming INSERT but also simultaneously inserts the data into MongoDB.\r\n\r\nI tried using `limit(1)` and the values of the `eventTime` are the same values meaning that the `incoming_doc` is inserted at the time of Change Stream INSERT Detection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a Specific API for obtaining the data that was previously within the DB before the change stream insertion or the method I am using is the only possible way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416473/obtain-the-previous-document-before-change-stream-inserts-the-new-one-in-mongodb","title":"Obtain the previous document before change stream inserts the new one in MongoDB pymongo"},{"tags":["ios","swift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6131,"user_id":5318223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be47da4995eb4e8dff0ab4637e5773d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kiril S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5318223/kiril-s"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571238750,"post_id":58416472,"comment_id":103175967,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416472/convert-an-object-to-nsdata-for-userdefaults#comment103175967_58416472"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":2603522,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4001e599fcd454ef7fdd48b17de54d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Kachlon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2603522/david-kachlon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571238883,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571238733,"creation_date":1571238399,"question_id":58416472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416472","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve tried this answer on StackOverflow\r\n\r\nOne:\r\n\r\n    UserDefaults.standard.set(NSKeyedArchiver.archivedData(withRootObject: [MadBank()]), forKey: &quot;AllBanks&quot;)\r\n              \r\nThis gives me the error:\r\n\r\n     reason: &#39;-[madbank.MadBank encodeWithCoder:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x6000030ef440&#39;\r\n\r\nSo please don&#39;t mark this is a duplicate, as every one of the results I&#39;ve found with this same error does *NOT* resolve my issue.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing I need to convert my MadBank() object to NSData.

Like :\r\n\r\nGet `user` from model :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = await User.find(1) //1 = id\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet `user` model from `auth` object :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = auth.user\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Switch authentication - [documentation][1]**\r\n```js\r\nconst user = auth.user\r\n\r\nconst token = const auth\r\n  .authenticator(&#39;jwt&#39;)\r\n  .generate(user)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### JWT authentication\r\ncreate token (from `User` model) :\r\n```js\r\nconst user = await User.find(1)//id = 1\r\n\r\nconst token await auth.generate(user)\r\n```\r\n*Now with the token it is possible to log in by putting it in the header of the query (REST concept)*\r\n\r\ncheck token :\r\n```js\r\ntry {\r\n  await auth.check()\r\n} catch (error) {\r\n  response.send(&#39;Missing or invalid jwt token&#39;)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[I have some examples of authentication middleware (JWT)][2] \r\n\r\n### Official documentation\r\n- [JWT Auth][3] \r\n- [Session Auth][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_switching_authenticators\r\n  [2]: https://gitlab.com/CrBast/website/tree/develop/website/app/Middleware\r\n  [3]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_jwt\r\n  [4]: https://adonisjs.com/docs/4.1/authentication#_session","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416430/custom-login-in-adonisjs-not-work-loginviaid/58421061#58421061","title":"custom login in adonisjs (not work loginViaId)"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":11620681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IEaHo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MohammadReza Abbasi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11620681/mohammadreza-abbasi"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571301088,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571291253,"creation_date":1571238270,"question_id":58416430,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416430","body_markdown":"I couldn&#39;t find a way to manually log in to a restapi app\r\n\r\nHelp me please\r\n\r\nnot work loginViaId , is only in &#39;session&#39;\r\n```\r\nauth.loginViaId(1)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416430/custom-login-in-adonisjs-not-work-loginviaid","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"custom login in adonisjs (not work loginViaId)"},{"tags":["python","pandas","geolocation","filtering"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":11901353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eOScFFEgaac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczRafc8tRO20YE8iwB5RvpYQt89w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mamed Mamedov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901353/mamed-mamedov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238647,"post_id":58416481,"comment_id":103175909,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416423/filter-points-between-polygons/58416481#comment103175909_58416481"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":11827280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17b5b8cf7bd6da7fb71f70b94898a405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dcacat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11827280/dcacat"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":54,"user_id":11901353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-eOScFFEgaac/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rczRafc8tRO20YE8iwB5RvpYQt89w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mamed Mamedov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11901353/mamed-mamedov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571241513,"post_id":58416481,"comment_id":103177475,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416423/filter-points-between-polygons/58416481#comment103177475_58416481"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":11827280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17b5b8cf7bd6da7fb71f70b94898a405?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dcacat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11827280/dcacat"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571238442,"creation_date":1571238442,"answer_id":58416481,"question_id":58416423,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416481","body_markdown":"What does your polygon data look like?

have not scan through the `JLS` as you have asked in your question, so please take this answer with a grain of salt. I wanted to make it a comment, but it would have been too big.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI find funny at times, how `javac` is pretty &quot;smart&quot; in some cases (like in your case), but leaves a lot of other things to be handled later by `JIT`. In this case, it is just that the compiler &quot;can tell&quot; that only a `RuntimeException` would be caught. This is obvious, it&#39;s the only thing you throw in `doSomething`. If you slightly change your code to:\r\n\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            Exception ex2 = new Exception();\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nyou will see a different behavior, because now `javac` can tell that there is a new `Exception` that you are throwing, un-related to the one you caught.\r\n\r\nBut things are far from ideal, you can &quot;trick&quot; the compiler yet again via:\r\n\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            Exception ex2 = new Exception();\r\n            ex2 = ex;\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex2;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIMO, because of `ex2 = ex;` it should not fail again, but it does.  \r\n\r\nJust in case this was compiled with `javac 13+33`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416402/catching-an-exception-and-rethrowing-it-but-its-not-an-exception/58438255#58438255","title":"Catching an Exception and rethrowing it, but it&#39;s not an Exception"}],"owner":{"reputation":11197,"user_id":1310566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3xuh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Forsberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1310566/simon-forsberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11197,"user_id":1310566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d3xuh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simon Forsberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1310566/simon-forsberg"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":10,"answer_count":1,"score":10,"last_activity_date":1571334888,"creation_date":1571238197,"last_edit_date":1571238435,"question_id":58416402,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416402","body_markdown":"I stumbled upon code looking something like this:\r\n\r\n    void run() {\r\n        try {\r\n            doSomething();\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Error: &quot; + ex);\r\n            throw ex;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void doSomething() {\r\n        throw new RuntimeException();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis code surprises me because it looks like the `run()`-method is capable of throwing an `Exception`, since it catches `Exception` and then rethrows it, but the method is not declared to throw `Exception` and apparently doesn&#39;t need to be.

I want to simply add to this existing dashboard.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  AutoScalingDashboardMetrics:\r\n    Type: AWS::CloudWatch::Dashboard\r\n    Properties: \r\n      DashboardBody: !Sub |\r\n        {\r\n          &quot;start&quot;: &quot;-PT9H&quot;,\r\n          &quot;periodOverride&quot;: &quot;inherit&quot;,\r\n          &quot;widgets&quot;: [\r\n              {\r\n                &quot;type&quot;:&quot;metric&quot;,\r\n                &quot;properties&quot;:{\r\n                    &quot;metrics&quot;: [\r\n                        [ &quot;AWS/AutoScaling&quot;, &quot;GroupTotalInstances&quot;, &quot;AutoScalingGroupName&quot;, &quot;${AWS::StackName}&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ],\r\n                        [ &quot;.&quot;, &quot;GroupStandbyInstances&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ],\r\n                        [ &quot;.&quot;, &quot;GroupDesiredCapacity&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, &quot;.&quot;, { &quot;period&quot;: 300 } ]\r\n                    ],\r\n                    &quot;view&quot;: &quot;timeSeries&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;stacked&quot;: false,\r\n                    &quot;region&quot;: &quot;{AWS::Region}&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;title&quot;: &quot;ASG Instances: ${AWS::StackName}&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;period&quot;: 300\r\n                }\r\n              }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      DashboardName: test\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416401/how-do-i-add-a-widget-to-an-existing-dashboard-in-aws","title":"How Do I add a widget to an existing dashboard in AWS?"},{"tags":["node.js","amazon-web-services","authorization","aws-api-gateway","amazon-cognito"],"owner":{"reputation":7927,"user_id":491553,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gh31e.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan Shillington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/491553/ryan-shillington"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571238183,"creation_date":1571238183,"question_id":58416398,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416398","body_markdown":"I have a custom authorizer for AWS Cognito using Node JS in Lambda and it works great.  It&#39;s basically using the code provided in [this tutorial][1].\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways my custom authorizer can fail: the user is using the wrong pool, the user submitted an invalid authorization token, etc.  Whenever this happens, I call:\r\n\r\n          context.fail(&quot;Unauthorized&quot;);\r\n\r\nand that works well too. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when the user&#39;s token has expired (which happens all the time, especially first thing in the morning if somebody left their browser open), I also call that same method, which is the only way I know of to return a 401 message.  This works and the user is returned back to the login page.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that in my Cloudwatch dashboard, where we&#39;re monitoring for broken code / suspicious activity, every time somebody leaves their browser open we see a Lambda error.  This is very noisy and makes it hard to catch somebody doing something suspicious.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSo my question: How can I fail the authorizer, return a 401 (or something else), not have the REST API execute and also NOT have an error show up in CloudWatch?\r\n\r\n  [1]:

It has to be in place before the config files are read.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416384/spring-boot-not-loading-default-profile-while-using-spring-profile-default-in-ap","title":"spring boot not loading default profile while using spring.profile.default in application.properties"},{"tags":["symfony","translators"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3752927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0d8aad08c87abac3043cf23f85cb3c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexglvr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3752927/alexglvr"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571306796,"post_id":58416607,"comment_id":103200782,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#comment103200782_58416607"},{"owner":{"reputation":266,"user_id":8934481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRTgT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nobady","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8934481/nobady"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3752927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0d8aad08c87abac3043cf23f85cb3c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alexglvr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3752927/alexglvr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571308790,"post_id":58416607,"comment_id":103201950,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#comment103201950_58416607"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":266,"user_id":8934481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vRTgT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nobady","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8934481/nobady"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571238846,"creation_date":1571238846,"answer_id":58416607,"question_id":58416383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416607","body_markdown":"to manage the translation in twig there is the appropriate trans function (example):\r\n\r\n    &lt;label for=&quot;inputUsername&quot; class=&quot;sr-only&quot;&gt;{{&#39;username&#39; | trans}}&lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nand in your messages.fr.yml add:\r\n\r\nusername: &quot;Nom d&#39;utilisateur&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416383/symfony-translation-how-to-translate-standard-expressions-forms/58416607#58416607","title":"symfony &amp; translation : How to translate standard expressions &amp; forms?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4883,"user_id":4275413,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/diRiJ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakumi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4275413/jakumi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571315282,"creation_date":1571315282,"answer_id":58432671,"question_id":58416383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58432671","body_markdown":"The default for form labels is to use a [&quot;humanized&quot;][1] version.

If not in the path, and you cache responses and multiple players can use the same client, then you need to look at making use of the HTTP Vary header to avoid one player getting another player&#39;s profile (from cache).\r\n\r\n3. I agree with the comment about API discoverability. If the back-end is telling the front-end what are the URLs via &quot;links&quot; (e.g. See HAL for an approach), then there is no concern about the &quot;design of the js client&quot;. The expectation is that the client gets the links from the service. I.e. &quot;If you want to get the player&#39;s profile, here is the link you use&quot;.\r\n\r\n4. If the expectation is that the id is not in the path, then it&#39;s better for the service to control that, by putting the id in a cookie, for example, so that it is certain to get it back in subsequent requests and the client doesn&#39;t even need to know.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416370/rest-api-design-url-design/58416818#58416818","title":"rest api design URL design"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26282,"user_id":54734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea91774321962f70f19362f43568cda9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VoiceOfUnreason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/54734/voiceofunreason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571244707,"creation_date":1571244707,"answer_id":58418186,"question_id":58416370,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418186","body_markdown":"&gt; How do you think the rest api of the backend server should look like and why ? \r\n\r\nAre you expecting caching to work?\r\n\r\n`api/players/{playerID}/profile` is easily cached; general purpose components expect to use the URI as a cache key, with which they will store and retrieve the document.

Anyone who obtains commit *C* acquires branch *B*.  If they had *their own* branch *B* before, well, now *their* branch *B* has a new commit *C* in it.\r\n\r\nGit *does not* do this.  Commits are not permanently tacked to branches.  However, commits *are* mostly permanent,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and permanently tacked to where they appear in the *commit graph*.  In order to make this work, commits aren&#39;t really made on *any* branches.  Instead, a branch name is merely a label.  Multiple labels can all point to the *same commit*, as in:\r\n\r\n&gt;     *   305f Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; (HEAD-&gt;master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\r\n\r\nHere `master` and `origin/master`&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; both identify commit `305f`.  If you create a new branch `br2` now, that name will *also* point to commit `305f`.\r\n\r\nCommit `305f` has *two* parents: `7a761b6` (its first parent) and `d97b` (its second parent).  The full name of `305f` is whatever its full hash ID is.  This will never change; and that hash ID is forever reserved for *that* commit, which will always have the same two parents.  That commit is frozen for all time and will never move.\r\n\r\nThe things in Git that *do* move are the *branch names*.  Currently, `master` means `305f`.  A moment ago, however, `master` meant `7a761b6`.  Commits stay in place, forever, as found by their raw hash IDs.  Branch names move about.\r\n\r\nThe result of all of this is that the set of branches that contain some commit changes, dynamically, as we create and destroy branch names.  At this time, the name `master` lets you find all four commits.  If you allow Git to move the name `master` in the ways that Git prefers, those four commits will continue to be reachable, by starting at `305f` and viewing both of its parents, then viewing the parent of `d97b` (and then from `d97b` you get back to `7a761b6` which you already saw).  Note that *new* commits only ever *add to the graph*.  In general, each new commit will have some existing commit as its parent—its only parent if it&#39;s a typical commit, or one of two parents if it&#39;s a merge commit.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nIf we draw these things sideways, it&#39;s a little easier.  To make it even easier than that, we can use single uppercase letters to stand in for the incomprehensible hash IDs that Git uses:\r\n\r\n            D--E   &lt;-- br1\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nHere, the name `br1` allows us to find commit `E`, which finds `D`, then `C`, then `B`, then `A` (and stops because `A` is the first commit).  The name `br2` allows us to find `G`, then `F`, then `C`, then `B`, then `A` (and then stop).  So the first three commits are on *both* branches, while two commits are each only one one branch.\r\n\r\nErasing the *name* `br1` causes commits `D` and `E` to become unfindable.  Eventually Git will throw them out for real.  If we instead add a new commit by doing `git checkout br1`, make whatever changes we want, `git add`, and `git commit`, we get a new hash ID `H` and advance the name `br1` to include it:\r\n\r\n            D--E--H   &lt;-- br1\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nNow there are six commits reachable from `br1`, starting with `H` and working backwards.  If we make a new name `br3` to remember where `E` is, we&#39;ll want to redraw the graph a bit:\r\n\r\n                 H   &lt;-- br2\r\n                /\r\n            D--E   &lt;-- br3\r\n           /\r\n    A--B--C\r\n           \\\r\n            F--G   &lt;-- br2\r\n\r\nNote that none of the *commits* have actually changed: we just shoved `H` up to make room for the label `br3`.\r\n\r\nIf we remove the *name* `br3` later, that&#39;s OK: there are no commits that are *exlusively* found through `br3`.  Commit `E` won&#39;t go away because `br1` finds `H` which finds `E`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The *mostly* comes about through *reachability*.  You *find* commits by starting from some branch or tag name, which supplies a raw hash ID.  Then, having found a commit, you use its parent hash ID(s) to find its predecessor commit(s).  Then you use *those* commits to find *their* parents, and so on.\r\n\r\nBy doing this process from *every* reference—see footnote 2—Git finds all *reachable* commits.  Any commits that exist in the repository, that are not reaachable by this process, eventually get garbage-collected and removed.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The name `master` is a branch name.  Its full name is really `refs/heads/master`, and names whose full name starts with `refs/heads/` are branch names.  By contrast, `origin/master` is actually a *remote-tracking* name: its full name starts with `refs/remotes/` and then goes on to say `origin/master`.  Git sometimes strips only the `refs/` part from this name, so that you see `remotes/origin/master`.\r\n\r\nTags, if you have any, live in `refs/tags/`.  These things are collectively called *refs* or *references*.  There are additional, hidden references kept in *reflogs*.  A reflog is simply a log file keeping the values—the previous hash IDs—that were stored in a ref before you, or Git, updated it.  These reflog entries eventually expire, which is how deliberately-abandoned commits—those you&#39;ve replaced with new-and-improved versions that have new hash IDs, for instance—are eventually cleaned out.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;The technical definition of a *merge commit* is that it is one with at least two parents.  You can therefore create a merge commit with 3 or more parents, too—but there&#39;s rarely a reason to do that.  I should also mention that it&#39;s possible to create a new commit with *no* parent.  Except for the very first commit—the one I label `A` in the sideways graph drawings—you won&#39;t do that in normal practice either.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416362/why-are-git-commits-on-a-merged-branch-showing-on-my-main-branch/58417829#58417829","title":"Why are git commits on a merged branch showing on my main branch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3024,"user_id":2874789,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VKbXD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christopher Shroba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2874789/christopher-shroba"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58417829,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571243154,"creation_date":1571238073,"question_id":58416362,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416362","body_markdown":"I currently have a git commit tree that looks something like this with pointers (?) in parentheses:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*   305f Merge branch &#39;develop&#39; (HEAD-&gt;master, origin/master, origin/HEAD)\r\n|\\\r\n| * d97b Some other commit on dev branch (develop) \r\n| * df14 Some commit on dev branch\r\n|/\r\n* 7a761b6 Initial commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve pushed master branch to remote (Gitlab, if it matters), and when I look at the commits on the master branch in the Gitlab UI, all 4 commits are present, where I would have expected only the &quot;Merge branch &#39;develop&#39;&quot; and &quot;Initial commit&quot; commits to be present on the master branch.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that `master` refers to the two commits I just listed, whereas `develop` refers to &quot;Some other...&quot; , &quot;Some commit...&quot;, and possibly &quot;Initial commit&quot; as well, since it is an ancestor.\r\n\r\nWhere am I going wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416362/why-are-git-commits-on-a-merged-branch-showing-on-my-main-branch","title":"Why are git commits on a merged branch showing on my main branch?"},{"tags":["python","selenium","openpyxl"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":933,"user_id":5226792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/khMGh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wonka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5226792/wonka"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571238258,"creation_date":1571238258,"answer_id":58416428,"question_id":58416360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416428","body_markdown":"You have to save en excel the content?

Some of the XML contains attributes, which show ```@attributes``` in the output. Somehow, I tried to ```console.log()``` the ```@attributes``` but failed. Here is the detail:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. In front-end, using JQuery AJAX, I send HTTP request to one of my PHP file.\r\n\r\n2. In back-end PHP, I retrieve data from DB where one of the column contains String of XML.\r\n\r\n3. Then, after retrieving, I used ```simplexml_load_string()``` function to convert the String of XML into true XML.\r\n\r\n4. Here is the example of String of XML:\r\n```\r\n&lt;dsconnector&gt;\r\n    &lt;statement&gt;\r\n        SELECT SUM(a.doc_amt) FROM gl_temp_trx_dt as a INNER JOIN gl_temp_trx_hd as b ON a.gl_hd_unique_id = b.unique_id\r\n    &lt;/statement&gt;\r\n    &lt;filter id=&quot;company123&quot; range=&quot;false&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;label&gt;Company&lt;/label&gt;\r\n        &lt;table&gt;company&lt;/table&gt;\r\n        &lt;field&gt;company_code&lt;/field&gt;\r\n        &lt;alias&gt;a&lt;/alias&gt;\r\n        &lt;desc&gt;company_name&lt;/desc&gt;\r\n        &lt;dependee&gt;glacc, glyear, glperiod&lt;/dependee&gt;\r\n    &lt;/filter&gt;\r\n&lt;/dsconnector&gt;\r\n```\r\nNotice that ```&lt;filter&gt;``` has two attributes\r\n\r\n5. After that, I used ```json_encode()``` function to output the converted XML\r\n\r\n6. In front-end, I used ```console.log()``` function to see what the output looks like, and here is part of the result:\r\n```\r\n0: {…}\r\n  &quot;@attributes&quot;: {…}\r\n     id: &quot;companyFilterId&quot;\r\n     range: &quot;false&quot;\r\n     &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { … }\r\n  alias: &quot;ar&quot;\r\n  dependee: &quot;projectFilterId_0123, phaseFilterId_ABCD, debtorAccFilterId&quot;\r\n  desc: &quot;company_name&quot;\r\n  field: &quot;company_code&quot;\r\n  label: &quot;Company&quot;\r\n  table: &quot;company&quot;\r\n  &lt;prototype&gt;: Object { … }\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. As you can see, the attributes part contains &quot;@&quot;.
