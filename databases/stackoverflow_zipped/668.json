main culprits are: `Dropout` layers, data preprocessing. In detail &amp; others:\r\n\r\n - `Dropout` on stacked LSTMs is known to yield poor performance, as it introduces too much noise for stable time-dependency feature extraction. **Fix**: use `recurrent_dropout`\r\n - If you are working with signal data, or otherwise data with (1) outliers; (2) phase information; (3) frequency information - `MinMaxScaler` will corrupt the latter two plus amplitude information per (1). **Fix**: use `StandardScaler`, or `QuantileTransformer`\r\n - Consider using `Nadam` optimizer over `SGD`; it proved vastly dominant in my LSTM applications, and is generally more hyperparameter-robust than `SGD`\r\n - Consider using `CuDNNLSTM`; it can run **10x faster**\r\n - Ensure your data&#39;s shaped properly for LSTM: `(batch_size, timesteps, features)` - or equivalently, `(samples, timesteps, channels)`\r\n\r\n_Note of warning_: if you do use `recurrent_dropout`, use `activation=&#39;tanh&#39;`, as `&#39;relu&#39;` is [unstable](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/issues/13221).\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: True culprit: insufficient data.

your parent element be the guide;\r\n\r\nWhen the goal is to rotate in a consistent spacing around a center (as opposed to say an &quot;elliptical orbit&quot; that is more of an oval pattern) than the easiest technique is to provide a parent to set a consistent boundary and attach children within it to use its position as their animation path. The goal is to just supply an illusion of individual elements orbiting in sync when in reality just one is rotating with its default `transform-origin` of center acting as the guide for the children &quot;orbiting&quot; within it.\r\n\r\nIn our case we took a parent whose equal circumference is roughly the size of the &quot;orbit desired&quot; and we gave it a `border-radius` of 50% to create a circle. This makes no point on the element less than or greater distance from the other. We make it a `position: relative` element so that we can apply `position: absolute` to any children of it. In this example we use pseudo elements but they could just as easily be additional DOM node elements like divs.\r\n\r\nBy fixing our children to specific points on the parent we create the equal distance from the X/Y of the parent&#39;s `transform-origin` center we desire and apply the `rotate` `transform` to spin the parent. However if we only did that then the children would also follow that path and not keep vertical (as it is assumed is desired) so we simply re-use the same animation applied to the parent but in `reverse` to offset its rotation. The result is a parent element spinning one direction, and the children in the other to create the effect seen in the example.

not sure if I got this right, but you want to delete rows that are not in `Sheet2`? \r\n\r\nSo that would make your `Sheet1` to be a copy of `Sheet2`, wouldn&#39;t it?\r\n\r\nWell, anyways, here is the code of the main `Sub`:\r\n\r\n    Sub Main()\r\n    Set idsToExclude = CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;): idsToExclude.CompareMode = TextCompare\r\n    &#39;fill dictionary with IDs from sheet 2\r\n    Set idsToExclude = CreateDictFromColumns(&quot;Sheet2&quot;, &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;)\r\n    &#39;find last populated row\r\n    xEndRow = Cells.Find(&quot;*&quot;, SearchOrder:=xlByRows, SearchDirection:=xlPrevious).Row\r\n\r\n    &#39;iterate all rows from bottom to top\r\n    For i = xEndRow To 2 Step -1\r\n        &#39;get value of cell at current row and 1st column\r\n        currentCellValue = ActiveSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value\r\n        &#39;if row doesnt met criteria, delete it\r\n        If Not idsToExclude.Exists(currentCellValue) Then\r\n            Rows(i).Delete\r\n        End If\r\n\r\n    Next\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAnd the `Function` to get the Ids and names from a specific `Sheet`:\r\n\r\n    Function CreateDictFromColumns(sheet As String, keyCol As String, valCol As String) As Object\r\n        Set dict = CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;): dict.CompareMode = TextCompare\r\n        Dim rng As Range\r\n        Dim i As Long\r\n        Dim lastCol As Long &#39;// for non-adjacent (&quot;A:ZZ&quot;)\r\n        Dim lastRow As Long\r\n        lastRow = Sheets(sheet).Range(keyCol &amp; Sheets(sheet).Rows.Count).End(xlUp).Row\r\n        Set rng = Sheets(sheet).Range(keyCol &amp; &quot;1:&quot; &amp; valCol &amp; lastRow)\r\n        lastCol = rng.Columns.Count\r\n        For i = 2 To lastRow\r\n            If (rng(i, 1).Value = &quot;&quot;) Then Exit Function\r\n            dict.Add rng(i, 1).Value, rng(i, lastCol).Value\r\n        Next\r\n        Set CreateDictFromColumns = dict\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you want to make the contrary (delete IDs in `Sheet1` that are in `Sheet2`), just remove the `Not` Operator from the following line:\r\n\r\n    If Not idsToExclude.Exists(currentCellValue) Then\r\n\r\nAs you can see, some parts are hard-coded. My suggestion is to adapt those parts and make it more dynamical, I had to write it like that due to lack of details in question.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382712/how-to-delete-all-rows-from-sheet1-which-is-not-in-sheet2/58384128#58384128","title":"How to delete all rows from sheet1 which is not in sheet2"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":3729345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/D1Ygo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aditya Dwivedi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3729345/aditya-dwivedi"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571087506,"creation_date":1571079983,"question_id":58382712,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382712","body_markdown":"friends I have Two Excel Sheets which is shown below...\r\n\r\n    **Sheet_1**           **Sheet_2**\r\n    ID  Name  Address      ID Name Address\r\n    1    A     Any         2   B     Any\r\n    2    B     Any         4   D     Any\r\n    3    C     Any         5   E     Any\r\n    4    D     Any\r\n    5    E     Any\r\n\r\nI want to delete all rows from Sheet_1 which is not in Sheet_2.\r\n\r\n**Note:** ID of sheets is unique","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382712/how-to-delete-all-rows-from-sheet1-which-is-not-in-sheet2","title":"How to delete all rows from sheet1 which is not in sheet2"},{"tags":["javascript","vue.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21879,"user_id":906113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eccce05f2ea328d45afe24843e009d25?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"str","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/906113/str"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571080627,"creation_date":1571080627,"answer_id":58382852,"question_id":58382711,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382852","body_markdown":"[vuejs-datepicker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuejs-datepicker)&#39;s `selected` callback is called with either a date object or null. \r\n\r\nYou can use the following example code to get a string representation of the date only:\r\n\r\n    CallDateFunction(date){\r\n      if (date) {\r\n        const dateString = date.toISOString().substring(0, 10);\r\n        console.log(dateString);\r\n      } else {\r\n        console.log(&#39;null date&#39;);\r\n      }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382711/vue-js-datepicker-getting-only-formatted-date-portion/58382852#58382852","title":"Vue js datepicker, getting only formatted date portion"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":540,"user_id":6080017,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156749383090171/picture?type=large","display_name":"Simon Thiel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6080017/simon-thiel"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571081432,"creation_date":1571081432,"answer_id":58382997,"question_id":58382711,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382997","body_markdown":"You can format your date with `Date.prototype.toISOString()` method and set it to your data:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncallDateFunction(rawDate){\r\n  if (rawDate)\r\n    this.formattedDate = rawDate.toISOString().split(&#39;T&#39;)[0]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also: https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toISOString","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382711/vue-js-datepicker-getting-only-formatted-date-portion/58382997#58382997","title":"Vue js datepicker, getting only formatted date portion"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10974611,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5dd19ae3649fff2d7679cd503545b4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Basler182","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10974611/basler182"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571137444,"creation_date":1571137444,"answer_id":58393191,"question_id":58382711,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58393191","body_markdown":"You can use the javascript function \r\n\r\n&gt;

you need 4 bytes on x32 or 8 bytes on x64 to store the reference to the memory address of the object (reference is a hidden pointer to forget to manage it).\r\n\r\nNext, the object has two data members here:\r\n\r\n- One integer that takes 4 bytes.\r\n- One string that here takes 5 chars : 5x2 bytes = 10 bytes.\r\n\r\nSo for data the object takes 18 bytes on x32 or 22 bytes on x64 system.\r\n\r\nSince string object contains an integer for the length, the size is a little more than that : 22 on x32 and 26 on x64.\r\n\r\nSince string is a reference, we need to add again 4 or 8

At this place the myInt is stored and the myString reference value (which is the reference to the real string value)\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s make sure you&#39;re not going down bad paths here.\r\n\r\nFirst off, it&#39;s unclear to me why you re-ordered the integer and the string in the diagram compared to the source code. It is implementation-defined how the string and the integer are packed, and in what order, and whether there are any padding bytes. If you care about these details, ask a more clear question.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is unclear what you mean by &quot;the real string value&quot;. Strings are of reference type. **The real value of the string is the reference**.  The values of the *contents* of the string are in the referenced location.\r\n\r\n&gt; if obj.myString shall be accessed, are there two &quot;lookups&quot; necessary, e.g. first looking up obj, then following it and looking up myString\r\n\r\nI assume that by &quot;lookup&quot; you mean *dereference*.\r\n\r\nSo for example, if we have:\r\n\r\n    var obj = whatever;\r\n    char c = obj.myString[1];\r\n\r\nthen yes, we have two dereferences. The `.` dereferences `obj` to get `myString`, which is a reference.  The `[1]` dereferences `myString` to get the `char`.\r\n\r\n&gt; Where is the reference value of obj stored?\r\n\r\n`obj` is a variable. A variable is a storage location. That storage location can be in a number of places:\r\n\r\n* If `obj` is short lived, or even better, ephemeral, then it can be enregistered or put on the short term pool. (More commonly known as the stack, but it is a better habit in my opinion to think of the short term pool in terms of its semantics, namely, **storage that lives not longer than activation**. The stack is an implementation detail.)\r\n\r\n* If `obj` is not known to be short lived then it goes on the long-term pool, also known as the managed heap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382702/how-would-the-memory-look-like-for-this-object/58384773#58384773","title":"How would the memory look like for this object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6295,"user_id":298288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20c1f68b1bb5c87878c69d5442855a28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"stefan.at.wpf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298288/stefan-at-wpf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6295,"user_id":298288,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/20c1f68b1bb5c87878c69d5442855a28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"stefan.at.wpf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298288/stefan-at-wpf"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":287,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58382808,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571250643,"creation_date":1571079924,"last_edit_date":1571250643,"question_id":58382702,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382702","body_markdown":"I am wondering how the memory layout for this class (its object) would look like:\r\n\r\n    class MyClass\r\n    {\r\n    \tstring myString;\r\n    \r\n    \tint myInt;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic MyClass(string str, int i)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tmyString = str;\r\n    \t\tmyInt = i;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    MyClass obj = new MyClass(&quot;hello&quot;, 42);\r\n\r\nCould anyone visualize that?\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nBased on the answer from Olivier Rogier and the comments from ckuri and Jon Skeet I tried to come up with a high level chart, heavily influenced by the [devblog article][1] mentioned by ckuri.\r\n\r\nSo to my understanding:\r\n\r\n 1. `obj` (8 bytes reference) points to the object including metadata (actually not to its beginning, but let&#39;s ignore that for simplicity).\r\n\r\n 2.

Or it will just cleanup the parameter( that is, content inside the object)?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not exactly sure what you&#39;re asking, but it will not &quot;clean up&quot; anything. Only the garbage collector cleans up objects, which happens when _nothing will be referencing them anymore_. Setting local variables to `null` will do nothing to make garbage cleanup any more efficient.\r\n\r\n&gt;If my modification follows the best practice, will the modified code work perfectly as previous code?\r\n\r\nFunctionally it is the same as the original block. The only difference is that the command is disposed of.\r\n\r\nNote that whatever _calls_ this method should dispose of the connection as soon as it&#39;s done with it. It&#39;s _not_ a best practice to keep a single connection object open and re-used. Connections are pooled by the framework so re-creating them generally isn&#39;t an expensive process, but leaving an unused connection open can cause issues.\r\n\r\nIf I were reviewing your code (which I guess I am) I would just scrap this method all together. There&#39;s no need to clear the Parameters property, and you can create the command and connection consecutively, disposing of them when the command finishes:\r\n\r\n    using(SqlConnection conn = Getconnection())\r\n    using(SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(commandText, conn) \r\n    {\r\n        cmd.CommandType = commandType;\r\n        cmd.Parameters = commandParameters;\r\n    \r\n        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382670/what-is-the-best-practice-dealing-with-sqlcommand/58382884#58382884","title":"What is the best practice dealing with SqlCommand"}],"owner":{"reputation":899,"user_id":1837976,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/05804c6d5abaee9ff88ecc3db83df870?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AskMe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1837976/askme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571101952,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571101936,"creation_date":1571079761,"last_edit_date":1571101936,"question_id":58382670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382670","body_markdown":"I came across this [sample code]([https://www.programering.com/a/MTOwATNwATI.html]), which I have modified a little bit.\r\n \r\n    public static int ExecuteNonQuery(SqlConnection conn, CommandType commandType, \r\n        string commandText, params SqlParameter[] commandParameters)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tSqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand();\r\n\r\n\t\tPrepareCommand(cmd, conn, (SqlTransaction)null, commandType, commandText, \r\n                       commandParameters);\r\n\r\n\t\tint ret = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\r\n\r\n\t\t// detach the SqlParameters from the command object, so they can be used again.\r\n\t\tcmd.Parameters.Clear();\r\n\r\n\t\treturn ret;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nHowever, I have a concern here in the above code. \r\n\r\nThat is, if the `ExecuteNonQuery` is getting called multiple times from the UI, there will be multiple new objects getting created.\r\n\r\nI understand, .NET has auto garbage collection; however, should not the `cmd` be explicitly taken care in the code?\r\n\r\nSo, I am thinking to modify this code like below.

&quot;...&quot;,\r\n              &quot;date&quot;: ...\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat you tried to do, is [destructing][1] **a not existing key `postQuery`**.\r\n\r\nMoreover, you still can log it outside of the component scope as the value exported from `export const postQuery`\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport const postQuery = graphql`\r\n  query MyQuery {\r\n    allMarkdownRemark {\r\n      edges {\r\n        node {\r\n          frontmatter {\r\n            path\r\n            title\r\n            date\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n`;\r\n\r\n//       v  Logs the query id\r\nconsole.log(&#39;my data:&#39;, postQuery);\r\n\r\n//                                               v Is not defined\r\nexport default function PostRepeater({ data, postQuery }) {\r\n\r\n  //                       v Shadowing the outter value of postQuery\r\n  console.log(&#39;my data:&#39;, postQuery);\r\n\r\n  // The query injected as &quot;data&quot; object\r\n  console.log(&#39;my data:&#39;, data);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;&gt;\r\n      //      v Be aware of which object you query, edges is an array\r\n

the help of [http_build_query](http://docs.php.net/manual/uk/function.http-build-url.php) (or its [polyfill](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49198715/372172)) in your environment, you can write a simple function to rewrite query parameters on the fly instead of using str_replace.\r\n\r\nFor example, to rewrite the &quot;category&quot; parameter, you may\r\n\r\n```php\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nfunction uri_rewrite_query($uri, $callback) {\r\n        $parsed = parse_url($uri);\r\n        parse_str($parsed[&#39;query&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;, $query);\r\n        $parsed[&#39;query&#39;] = http_build_query($callback($query));\r\n        return http_build_url($uri, $parsed);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction query_remove_category($query) {\r\n  unset($query[&#39;category&#39;]);\r\n  return $query;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction query_replace_category($category) {\r\n  return function ($query) use ($category) {\r\n    $query[&#39;category&#39;] = $category;\r\n    return $query;\r\n  };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can do these:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\n$uri = &#39;/beverages.php?lang=ru&amp;category=some_category&#39;;\r\n\r\necho uri_rewrite_query($uri, &#39;remove_category&#39;);\r\n// Result: /beverages.php?lang=ru\r\n\r\necho uri_rewrite_query($uri, query_replace_category(&#39;Безалкогольные напитки&#39;));\r\n// Result: /beverages.php?lang=ru&amp;category=%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B5+%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%BA%D0%B8 (equivalant to &quot;/beverages.php?lang=ru&amp;category=Безалкогольные напитки&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you&#39;re only interested in the query string:\r\n```php\r\nfunction uri_get_query() {\r\n  $parsed = parse_url($uri);\r\n  parse_str($parsed[&#39;query&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;, $query);\r\n  return $query;\r\n}\r\n\r\necho &#39;/food.php?&#39; . http_build_query(query_remove_category($_SERVER[&#39;QUERY_STRING&#39;] ?? &#39;&#39;));\r\necho &#39;/food.php?&#39; . http_build_query(query_replace_category(&#39;Безалкогольные

As a result, `//foo` only matches unprefixed `foo` elements.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382631/wiremock-and-xpath-attribute-testing/58410571#58410571","title":"Wiremock and XPath attribute testing"}],"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":6523288,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ec6758d645d1c8869a007f79bfb6d3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dragas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6523288/dragas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571219758,"creation_date":1571079596,"question_id":58382631,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382631","body_markdown":"Assume I have an XML request containing the following snippet\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;foo bar=&quot;12356&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy service sends this snippet to another services to do things.

one after another and you shouldn&#39;t have problems\r\n\r\nThis is not what your code does.

This most likely will result in X almost parallel requests which lead to the `too many request` response.\r\n\r\nA way to solve this is to wrap your code into an async function and `await` it. For that to work you have to tweak `sendMessage` a little bit to return the promise (or use `client.messages.create` directly) that is returned by the Twilio helper library.\r\n\r\n    async function sendMessage(params) {\r\n      return client.messages.create(params)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith these adjustments, you can wrap your loop into an async function and wait for every request to succeed first.\r\n\r\n    (async () =&gt; {\r\n      while (numberStart &lt; numbersLen) {\r\n        try {\r\n          let maxNumbers = Math.min(numbersLen, numberStart + recipientAmount);\r\n    \r\n          for (let i = numberStart; i &lt; maxNumbers; i++) {\r\n            let number = numbers[i][&#39;phone_number&#39;].replace(/[^\\d]/g, &#39;&#39;)\r\n            if (number.length &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; number[0] === &#39;1&#39;) {\r\n              number = number.substring(1)\r\n              cleanNumbers.push(&#39;1&#39; + number)\r\n            } else {\r\n              cleanNumbers.push(&#39;1&#39; + number)\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            if (i == maxNumbers - 1) {\r\n              var params = {\r\n                &#39;body&#39;: `${event_sms_message}`,\r\n                &#39;messagingServiceSid&#39;: &#39;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&#39;,\r\n                &#39;to&#39;: cleanNumbers\r\n              }\r\n    \r\n            await sendMessage(params)\r\n    \r\n            cleanNumbers = []\r\n            numberStart = numberStart + recipientAmount;\r\n          }\r\n        } catch(e) {\r\n          console.error(e);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nThis code will then wait for `client.message.create` to succeed and you shouldn&#39;t run into rate limiting errors (`too many requests`) anymore. \r\n\r\nLet me know if that helps. :) ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382625/bulk-sms-twilio/58389592#58389592","title":"Bulk SMS - Twilio"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11843328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c578850f4b2d58edd2d1f0735fcb041?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MCM13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11843328/mcm13"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58389592,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571125306,"creation_date":1571079588,"question_id":58382625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382625","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to send SMS with Twilio SMS api.

Once the elements are in the DOM, the javascript can find them.\r\n\r\nSide note; `Document` in your snippet should be `document` as it is case sensative.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382598/where-to-put-document-readyfunction/58383005#58383005","title":"Where to put $(Document).ready(function(){});"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1585,"user_id":451893,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0dba10774351090583ce306ef0ca805b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Les Nightingill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/451893/les-nightingill"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571108423,"creation_date":1571108423,"answer_id":58386632,"question_id":58382598,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386632","body_markdown":"You define the files included in application.js, you can `require` them explicitly if their loading sequence needs to be controlled.

It can be difficult to read if you put lots of code inside the document ready wrapper, keep it simple. It&#39;s best to use just one document ready wrapper, so that you are sure of the initialization

When I download a generated ```.xlsx``` file with Chrome, I can not open it with Excel (2019), since Excel prompts that the file is corrupted, offers to repair it but fails.\r\n\r\nFirst i suspected something wrong with the generator or the download process, but I&#39;ve tested the download with Firefox, Edge and Filezilla - everything works as expected. \r\n\r\nA comparison of the downloaded files in hex shows just one minor difference: At the end of the .xlsx file downloaded with other Browsers, I see\r\n```\r\n786d 6c2e 7265 6c73 504b 0506 0000 0000\r\n0b00 0b00 d102 0000 671d 0000 0000 \r\n```\r\nbut the Chrome-Download shows \r\n```\r\n786d 6c2e 7265 6c73 504b 0506 0000 0000\r\n0b00 0b00 d102 0000 671d 0000 0000 0909\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have no idea where these extra 09&#39;s are coming from. Those are two tabs (09) chrome is adding and thus corrupting the file. OpenOffice&#39;s Calc is able to read it but Excel just can&#39;t open it.\r\n\r\nSo, again, my question is: Why is Chrome seemingly adding two tabs to the end of my file? And what can I do to prevent this? \r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\nI have narrowed the problem down to &quot;logged in with Chrome&quot; (logged in into the yii-application, not Chrome!). Meaning: I can download and open the file with Firefox and Edge, logged in or not logged in **and** it works with Chrome when I am **not** logged in. I would blame the login but then this should also corrupt the file / add 2 extra 09&#39;s when I download it with Firefox or Edge... \r\n\r\n**Update 2:**\r\nI have installed the new Edge Version 78.0.276.17 (Official build) beta (64-bit) that&#39;s based on the Chromium Engine: **Same Problem!** Logged in: File corrupt. Not logged in: File works!\r\n\r\n**Update 3:**\r\nI&#39;ve tested a random file.txt that i uploaded via FTP and there are 2 tabs added to the end of the file, when i download it via the yii&#39;s sendFile-Method:\r\n```\r\npublic function actionTest(){\r\n   Yii::$app-&gt;response-&gt;sendFile(&#39;test.txt&#39;)-&gt;send();\r\n   return true;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf I download the file by directly linking to it, it&#39;s perfectly fine. Again it&#39;s a combination of Chromium, being logged in and the sendFile-method, it seems.

are the module dependencies which are only required during the **active development** of your web application. For example, when you&#39;re coding new features into your web application. A lot of `devDependencies` will make development easier on your end and can provide functionality such as linting, bundling, transpiling, etc... \r\n\r\nIn contrast, regular `dependencies` are the modules which are **necessary during the runtime** of your web application. I.e. these are the necessary dependencies for your web application to work correctly when other users want to interact with your web application.\r\n\r\n**Note**: By module I mean the underlying code from the library which you&#39;re leveraging. A more complete definition can be found [here][1]. \r\n\r\nYour concerns about including more code than necessary for your production bundle are valid, and I would recommend reading more about the [Cost of JavaScript][2]. However, in the beginning I would encourage one to first get a working code base, and to keep iterating and improving your code as your skillset grows. Improving performance along the way.\r\n\r\nLastly, some common type of `devdependencies` include libraries for testing your code base, building, minifying, bundling, transpiling, and linting your code as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.npmjs.com/about-packages-and-modules\r\n  [2]: https://medium.com/@addyosmani/the-cost-of-javascript-in-2018-7d8950fbb5d4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382550/need-validation-of-my-understanding-of-dev-dependencies-and-dependencies/58383079#58383079","title":"Need validation of my understanding of dev-dependencies and dependencies"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11793805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2576f7ec4e87045607172be5b16df2be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11793805/sam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11415,"user_id":4420967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pYX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4420967/james-z"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58383079,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571082440,"creation_date":1571079217,"last_edit_date":1571081855,"question_id":58382550,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58382550","body_markdown":"I am a beginner (~15 days into learning web-development) and I am currently learning React among other things and I am sorry if this sounds too trivial.\r\n \r\nI am trying to understand the difference between devDependencies and dependencies and the correct usage of the same. \r\n\r\nI have tried to figure it out from the docs and stackoverflow questions but I am not a 100% sure if I have this right.

Please let me know if I am erring somewhere:\r\n\r\n- babel-cli : devDependency\r\n- babel-core: devDependency\r\n- babel-loader: devDependency\r\n- babel-plugin-transform-class-properties: devDependency\r\n- babel-preset-env: devDependency\r\n- babel-preset-react: devDependency\r\n- css-loader: devDependency\r\n- node-sass: dependency\r\n- react: dependency\r\n- react-dom: dependency\r\n- react-modal: dependency\r\n- sass-loader: dependency\r\n- style-loader: dependency\r\n- validator: dependency\r\n- webpack: dev-dependency\r\n- webpack-dev-server: dev-dependency\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I have any of these wrong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382550/need-validation-of-my-understanding-of-dev-dependencies-and-dependencies","title":"Need validation of my understanding of dev-dependencies and dependencies"},{"tags":["c++","multidimensional-array","dynamic-memory-allocation","access-violation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7054,"user_id":487892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Leb5B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"drescherjm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/487892/drescherjm"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571079305,"post_id":58382548,"comment_id":103113243,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382548/access-violation-writing-location-0xcccccccc-creating-2d-array#comment103113243_58382548"},{"owner":{"reputation":26639,"user_id":3133316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30f0b31e22bec21f12f31cd30ae5b148?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PaulMcKenzie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3133316/paulmckenzie"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571079520,"post_id":58382548,"comment_id":103113319,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382548/access-violation-writing-location-0xcccccccc-creating-2d-array#comment103113319_58382548"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":2261538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4e60dd44745bd1518ee933e081119de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"darune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2261538/darune"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571080379,"post_id":58382548,"comment_id":103113662,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382548/access-violation-writing-location-0xcccccccc-creating-2d-array#comment103113662_58382548"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":8950892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5amKK.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SupremeNoodle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8950892/supremenoodle"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571080231,"post_id":58382695,"comment_id":103113599,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382548/access-violation-writing-location-0xcccccccc-creating-2d-array/58382695#comment103113599_58382695"},{"owner":{"reputation":1057,"user_id":5199418,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nLvUH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CaitLAN Jenner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5199418/caitlan-jenner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571080550,"post_id":58382695,"comment_id":103113736,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58382548/access-violation-writing-location-0xcccccccc-creating-2d-array/58382695#comment103113736_58382695"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1394,"user_id":3188346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85fbdb414d9dcf1e2a79fe37eb16aec9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"luantkow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3188346/luantkow"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571079888,"creation_date":1571079888,"answer_id":58382695,"question_id":58382548,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382695","body_markdown":"The `[]` operator takes precedence over `*`.
