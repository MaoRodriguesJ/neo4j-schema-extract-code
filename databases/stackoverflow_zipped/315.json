When the outer loop quits, the last n items in the array will be the n largest values.\r\n\r\n*Edit (in response to comment):*\r\n\r\nThe word **pass** in the above definition refers to the number of times the outer loop runs. Without having information about the array it is hard to determine the exact number of iterations of the inner loop. Take the following example:\r\n\r\n    [1, 2, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nThis is alreayd sorted. If `b = 2`, then after two **passes**, it is guaranteed that the last two elements are the largest (3 and 4). But the program does not even enter the inner loop. Now if this is the array:\r\n\r\n    [4, 3, 2, 1]\r\n\r\nagain after two passes, we will have:\r\n\r\n    [2, 1, 3, 4]\r\n\r\nThe difference is, the inner loop iterated 3 times and 2 times respectively to put 3 and 4 at tail of the array. For a completely reverse sorted array, the inner loop will do total:\r\n\r\n    (n - 1) + (n - 2) + ... + 1\r\n\r\niterations.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort#Optimizing_bubble_sort","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462840/how-to-stop-bubble-sort-when-top-n-values-are-found/58462925#58462925","title":"How to stop bubble sort when top n values are found?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12242561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29801c2cb03c305d499be50366af6c99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"User 2524","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12242561/user-2524"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12242561,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29801c2cb03c305d499be50366af6c99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"User 2524","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12242561/user-2524"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571485816,"creation_date":1571481747,"last_edit_date":1571484299,"question_id":58462840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462840","body_markdown":"I am currently learning Java and I have a question to ask about bubble sort. \r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say I have an array of numbers called array and I sort it using bubble sort.\r\n```java\r\nint[] array = {10, 22, 30, 50, 11, 22, 80, 66, 55, 32};\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; b; i++) {\r\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; array.length - 1 -i; j++) {\r\n                  if (array[j + 1] &lt; array[j]) {\r\n                    int temp;\r\n                    temp = array[j];\r\n                    array[j] = array[j + 1];\r\n                    array[j + 1] = temp;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nMy goal is to find the largest n values of the list and **stop the sorting once n largest values are found**.

derived a custom exception class from `std::runtime_error`\r\n\r\nstatic analyzer is giving me a warning that if I define or delete default operation (copy ctors, copy/move operators, destructors etc..), I should define or delete them all.\r\n\r\nto resolve this silly warning, I wrote the missing assignment operator but then I got another warning that now my operator hides the base non virtual assignment operator!\r\n\r\nSince base class has private members which I cant copy it looks like the only solution is to invoke base asignment operator directly for base object part and the copy the rest of `*this` object and finaly return `*this`\r\n\r\nbut before doing that I took a look on what the base `operator=` does and here what it looks like:\r\n\r\n    exception&amp; operator=(exception const&amp; _Other) noexcept\r\n    {\r\n        if (this == &amp;_Other)\r\n        {\r\n            return *this;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        __std_exception_destroy(&amp;_Data);\r\n        __std_exception_copy(&amp;_Other._Data, &amp;_Data);\r\n        return *this;\r\n    }\r\n    private:\r\n    \r\n        __std_exception_data _Data;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNow knowing that Here is my implementation (with comments) to invoke base asignment and the copy the rest of the derived object:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tclass Exception :\r\n\t\tpublic std::runtime_error\r\n\t{\r\n\tpublic:\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n\t\tException&amp; operator=(const Exception&amp; other)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif (this == &amp;other)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\treturn *this;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// first copy only base class data to *this\r\n\t\t\t*dynamic_cast&lt;std::runtime_error*&gt;(this) =\r\n\t\t\t\truntime_error::operator=(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t*dynamic_cast&lt;std::runtime_error*&gt;(\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\tconst_cast&lt;Exception*&gt;(&amp;other)));\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// then copy derived class data to *this\r\n\t\t\tmInfo = other.mInfo;\r\n\t\t\tmCode = other.mCode;\r\n\r\n            // finally return complete copy\r\n\t\t\treturn *this;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate:\r\n\t\tstd::error_code mCode;\r\n\t\tstd::string mInfo;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\nIs this correct way to do this?

&quot;from&quot;: &quot;abc&quot;,\r\n                &quot;localField&quot;: &quot;abc_id&quot;,\r\n                &quot;foreignField&quot;: &quot;abc_id&quot;,\r\n                &quot;as&quot;: &quot;abc_info&quot;,\r\n                &quot;unwinding&quot;: { &quot;preserveNullAndEmptyArrays&quot;: false }\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n\r\nim getting the errror \r\n\r\n        &quot;arguments to $lookup must be strings, unwinding: { \r\n        preserveNullAndEmptyArrays: false } is type object&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462805/unwinding-preservenullandemptyarrays-false-not-working-in-v3-4-aggrega","title":"&quot;unwinding&quot;: {

can be answered.\r\n\r\nFirst thing to realize is that the example in the question has nothing to do with autowiring or dependency injection in general.\r\n```\r\npublic function dostuff(StuffGenerator $stuff) {\r\n  $stuff-&gt;do();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe implication of the above example is that some mysterious force is injecting stuff directly into methods which in turn immediately acts upon them.  Well no.  Autowire does not do this.  And I certainly would not want methods being called with arguments from who knows where.\r\n\r\nSo lets rewrite the example:\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n    private $stuff;\r\n    public function __construct(StuffGenerator $stuff) {\r\n        $this-&gt;stuff = $stuff;\r\n    }\r\n    public function doStuff() {\r\n        $this-&gt;stuff-&gt;do();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn almost all cases, dependencies are injected into constructors and then stored as member variables.  Nothing mysterious going on in the rest of the class.  You can argue about injecting $stuff vs having the constructor accessing $stuff from say a singleton.  I won&#39;t get into that argument here as it is basically off topic with respect to autowire.\r\n\r\nFor the above MyClass example to work using the Symfony container requires that the container be aware of what dependencies are needed.  Back in the old pre-autowire days (prior to 3.1 or so), a developer had to manually define each service.  Something like:\r\n```\r\n# app/config/services.yml\r\nservices:\r\n    app.stuff_generator:\r\n        class App\\StuffGenerator\r\n    app.myclass:\r\n        class: App\\MyClass\r\n            arguments:\r\n                - &#39;@app.stuff_generator&#39;\r\n```\r\nNot hard to do but as the number of services grew so did the size of the services file.  Just as a trip down memory lane, [here](https://github.com/cerad/ng2016/blob/aoc2017/src/AppBundle/Action/Game/services.yml) is one of about 6 different service definition files for one of my S2.x apps.  It was actually kind of nice having all the definitions in one place.  Made it easier to see how things were wired up.  But it definitely got tedious.\r\n\r\nSo now we come to the actual question.  Assuming that you buy into the notion of using dependency injection in combination with a service container, then autowire simplifies the process of defining your services in your container.  For the MyClass example, no manual service configuration is needed at all assuming there is only one StuffGenerator instance floating around.  And of course you will run into things like scaler dependencies that require manual definitions.  But still, hundreds and hundreds of lines of configuration can be reduced to perhaps a few dozen.\r\n\r\nAnd that is what autowire solves.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462795/symfony-what-does-autowiring-solve/58465315#58465315","title":"Symfony: what does autowiring solve?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6008,"user_id":95733,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":32,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIVbe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"commonpike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/95733/commonpike"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6008,"user_id":95733,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":32,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dIVbe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"commonpike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/95733/commonpike"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571574728,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571499796,"creation_date":1571481336,"last_edit_date":1571481653,"question_id":58462795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462795","body_markdown":"Correct me if I&#39;m wrong - Symfony autowiring allows a programmer to automagically get an instance of a Service as an argument to a function by typehinting that argument.\r\n\r\nSo instead of typing (for example)\r\n\r\n    public function dostuff() {\r\n      $stuff = StuffGenerator::getInstance();\r\n      $stuff-&gt;do();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can now type\r\n\r\n    public function dostuff(StuffGenerator $stuff) {\r\n      $stuff-&gt;do();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand then just *trust $stuff is good*.

Then you check `count != 0`, cause you just did `count += 1`, because `count` was 0. Then `if (previous == buffer[i])`, which also will be always true, because you just did `previous = buffer[i]` int he first if. Then you increment count again.\r\n\r\nI think you miss an else:\r\n\r\n            if (count == 0)                                                     \r\n            {                                                                   \r\n                previous = buffer[i];                                           \r\n                count += 1;                                                     \r\n            } else                                                      \r\n            if (count != 0)                                                     \r\n            {                                                                   \r\n                if (previous == buffer[i])                                      \r\n                {                                                               \r\n                    count += 1;                                                 \r\n                }      \r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n- I think you are mixing `fgets` with `read` calls. The `buffer[c] = &#39;\\0&#39;;` is unneeded, the `read` call just reads bytes from the file descriptors, whatever they are, and if `c` will be too bug for `buffer`, it will be out-of-bounds access.\r\n- You are not printing the count of the last character of the file. It just so happens, that your file ends with a newline - the `previous` is set to newline on the last execution of your loop. If your file wouldn&#39;t end with w newline, the count of the last character won&#39;t be printed.\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462751/c-write-to-file-number-of-occurrences-of-character/58462827#58462827","title":"C - Write to file number of occurrences of character"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12142661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09999ad50e726ed48eb8a6b8d686ad35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"revcat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12142661/revcat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12142661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09999ad50e726ed48eb8a6b8d686ad35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"revcat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12142661/revcat"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58462827,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571482075,"creation_date":1571481034,"last_edit_date":1571481275,"question_id":58462751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462751","body_markdown":"I am writing an encoding function, that takes a file descriptor from the source file, and a FILE* as the destination file.

The drawing area&#39;s contents, once drawn, are not persisted anywhere.\r\n\r\nIf you need persistent window contents, then you should use a backing store and draw that onto the screen in the draw handler, or you could use a canvas library if you want to treat existing drawn objects as independently existing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462728/how-not-to-get-a-gtkdrawingarea-cleared-in-the-draw-event/58469708#58469708","title":"How not to get a gtkdrawingarea cleared in the draw event?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9016395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2280d7c36cbb1feaa4d79eff2d031033?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Seb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9016395/seb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571652965,"creation_date":1571652965,"answer_id":58484167,"question_id":58462728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58484167","body_markdown":"I found he answer :\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n    \r\n    import gi\r\n    gi.require_version(&#39;Gtk&#39;,&#39;3.0&#39;)\r\n    from gi.repository import Gtk, Gdk\r\n    import cairo\r\n    import math\r\n    \r\n    class MouseButtons:\r\n        LEFT_BUTTON = 1\r\n        RIGHT_BUTTON = 3\r\n    \r\n    class Example(Gtk.Window):\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            super(Example, self).__init__()\r\n            self.init_ui()\r\n    \r\n        def init_ui(self):    \r\n    \r\n            self.darea = Gtk.DrawingArea()\r\n            self.darea.connect(&quot;draw&quot;, self.on_draw)\r\n            self.darea.set_events(Gdk.EventMask.BUTTON_PRESS_MASK)        \r\n    \r\n            self.add(self.darea)\r\n    \r\n            self.set_title(&quot;Fill &amp;

The API does some work to get a *.csv file into Cloud Storage (using signedURL&#39;s), confirms that it has uploaded, and then creates and executes a load job to transfer the csv from Storage to BigQuery.\r\nThe part of the API that is exacerbating my hair loss is the call to execute a load job in GCP that loads a csv file to BigQuery. Here is a snippet of the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n            dataset_ref = bq_client.dataset(target_dataset) \r\n            job_config.schema =  bq_schema \r\n            job_config.source_format = SOURCE_FORMAT \r\n            job_config.field_delimiter =  DELIM  \r\n            job_config.destination_table_description = TARGET_TABLE\r\n            job_config.encoding = ENCODING \r\n            job_config.max_bad_records = MAX_BAD_RECORDS\r\n            job_config.autodetect = False # Do not autodetect schema\r\n            load_job = bq_client.load_table_from_uri(\r\n                uri, dataset_ref.table(target_table), job_config=job_config\r\n            )  # API request\r\n            load_job.result() # **&lt;-- This is the concern**\r\n            return {&quot;message&quot;: &quot;Successfully uploaded to Bigquery&quot;}, 200\r\n```\r\nThe file can  take some time to transfer, and my concern is that during periods where there is some latency, the webserver will timeout whilst waiting for the transfer to take place. I would much prefer to have `load_job.result()` execute, get the job ID and return a 201 response. Then I can use the job ID to poll GCP to determine whether it was successful or not, rather than have there be a risk of the request timing out for the client-side front-end and leave the user confused as to whether it succeeded or not.\r\n\r\nI understand that load_job.result() is async, but with Flask that doesn&#39;t help. I was going to change over to Quart to use async/await but my other dependencies are not supported and therefore I will have a lot of refactoring to do. Is there another way that anyone has used to approach this type of problem?\r\nCheers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462718/is-there-a-way-to-execute-non-blocking-load-job-from-bigquery-python-client-libr","title":"Is there a way to execute non-blocking load_job from BigQuery Python Client library?"},{"tags":["android","kotlin","webview","youtube-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2522,"user_id":3790052,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p0vkn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SRB bans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3790052/srb-bans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571482026,"post_id":58462717,"comment_id":103261356,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462717/how-to-fullscreen-click-then-application-terminated-in-android-kotlin-webview#comment103261356_58462717"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":5914929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-M1SoU0q8PaM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA8M/UaSXFv1ECts/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vashvi Vekariya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5914929/vashvi-vekariya"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571480779,"creation_date":1571480779,"question_id":58462717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462717","body_markdown":"Kotlin Webview app won&#39;t let video player go full screen.\r\nwhen I click on the player button to go full screen it only stops the video from playing while never launching into full screen mode and Application terminated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462717/how-to-fullscreen-click-then-application-terminated-in-android-kotlin-webview","title":"How to fullscreen click then Application terminated in Android kotlin WebView?"},{"tags":["swift","swiftui"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12134656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2684016781854110/picture?type=large","display_name":"Igor Samtsevich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12134656/igor-samtsevich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571484352,"post_id":58462818,"comment_id":103261867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462716/how-to-force-view-update-onappear-in-swift-ui/58462818#comment103261867_58462818"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":417,"user_id":10208552,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FTeDHn3-m6w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAZAw/Gvz_306hLGQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sorin Lica","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10208552/sorin-lica"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571481544,"creation_date":1571481544,"answer_id":58462818,"question_id":58462716,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58462818","body_markdown":"   &quot;texts&quot;

I haven&#39;t use OPServer. So I am not going to comment on this. But I would like to share my opinion about elasticsearch how your use case can be achievable on this. \r\n\r\nAs far I understand you have two things need to log:\r\n\r\n1. Every Exception/Errors  \r\n2. Middleware Query logs\r\n\r\nELKB stack is designed for these use cases only. Where there will be a river kind of flow. Your logs will keep storing in Elasticsearch.\r\n\r\nBelow are a few steps for how you can achieve your use case:\r\n\r\n**Step 1**: Setup Elasticsearch. For this, you don&#39;t need to be any professional. Just follow the wonderfull document they have.  \r\n**Step 2**: Setup Logstash / Filebeat which will read your logs file in realtime and keep inserting in Elasticsearch.  \r\n**Step 3**: Setup Kibana over the elasticsearch. You will get a complete view of your data logs.  \r\n**Step 4**: Just add logs point in your app where you will get Exceptions or you want to log something else.  \r\n\r\n**PROS** :\r\n\r\n1. All tools are readymade and used by many other organizations with very heavy use cases. So it will be fit in your use case too.\r\n2. Very good documentation and community support.\r\n3. Great data view by kibana. You can create your own dashboard. It is like one view for your whole system logs.\r\n4. There are already Some of beats available like MySQL beats, Nginx Beats, Apache beats, Mongo DB, etc.. Here you have to just plug and start using those.\r\n5. It will be your centralize architecture whenever you want to add some new type of logs, You need to just start writing in the same log file and it will start logging.  \r\n\r\nThere are lots of prons you will find on the Internet.\r\n\r\n**CONS**:\r\n\r\n1. You can set alert over this using &#39;watcher&#39;, which is paid.\r\n2. If you want to set open source alert, You can go with alertmanager (Prometheus) where you need to do some extra integrations.\r\n\r\nBelow are a few Use cases I would like to share.

Our project is layered in 3 tiers - client (Winforms Application), middle ware (.NET Core 3.0 Web API), Database (PostgreSQL). I was assigned to find the optimal way to implement a logging and monitoring system.\r\n\r\nWhat we need is log every exception (of course), as well as every query that our middle ware does to our database and also some audit logs. Bear in mind that these logs will occur very often since the users are more than 200 concurrently.\r\n\r\nAt first my search began from the noSQL databases. I was thinking of picking MongoDb, Cassandra or ElasticSearch, since they are fast and do not need a specific schema and log everything there. But then I stumbled upon [this great blog post](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2018/11/29/stack-overflow-how-we-do-monitoring/#opserver)  by Nick Craver - the Architecture Lead for Stack Exchange. There he mentions the use of [StackExchange.Exceptional](https://github.com/NickCraver/StackExchange.Exceptional) and I think that this is what we actually need.\r\n**But** I am not sure how to actually use it and which of all those great solutions that Nick gives I need for my use case.\r\n\r\nSo I am asking:\r\n\r\n1. if you have ever used Exceptional enlighten me of its uses\r\n2. do i need OPServer too to monitor the logs?\r\n3. am I still better using just Mongo?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462701/right-tools-to-implement-logging-and-monitoring","title":"Right tools to implement logging and monitoring"},{"tags":["python","list","loops"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23387,"user_id":4804629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGzEm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"splash58","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4804629/splash58"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571480739,"post_id":58462700,"comment_id":103261075,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462700/how-to-remove-some-items-up-to-a-certain-index-from-the-end-in-python#comment103261075_58462700"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12242626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA5R4gjD1unjfP4ZKa3B7zB7MTFB7qhGVq88X3Z=k-s128","display_name":"Subhajit Majumder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12242626/subhajit-majumder"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23387,"user_id":4804629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGzEm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"splash58","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4804629/splash58"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571480804,"post_id":58462700,"comment_id":103261098,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462700/how-to-remove-some-items-up-to-a-certain-index-from-the-end-in-python#comment103261098_58462700"},{"owner":{"reputation":2518,"user_id":8353711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QCK5wOmepy8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/bN55efAFaFY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"shaik moeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8353711/shaik-moeed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571483644,"post_id":58462700,"comment_id":103261716,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462700/how-to-remove-some-items-up-to-a-certain-index-from-the-end-in-python#comment103261716_58462700"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":47868,"user_id":584192,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2ea8790040ee3f38d779c56dd63e45c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Samuel Liew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/584192/samuel-liew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571513237,"post_id":58462738,"comment_id":103269046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462700/how-to-remove-some-items-up-to-a-certain-index-from-the-end-in-python/58462738#comment103269046_58462738"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2518,"user_id":8353711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QCK5wOmepy8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/bN55efAFaFY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"shaik moeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8353711/shaik-moeed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2518,"user_id":8353711,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QCK5wOmepy8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABk/bN55efAFaFY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"shaik moeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8353711/shaik-moeed"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571484797,"last_edit_date":1571484797,"creation_date":1571480932,"answer_id":58462738,"question_id":58462700,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58462738","body_markdown":"Try this,\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;

suggest trying to find an alternative to this kind of usage of `tryCatch`. It can make code much more difficult to read, make unexpected errors almost undetectable and in the case that any package used within `tryCatch` changes it&#39;s code, your code will simply stop working, while yielding no distinguishable error. \r\n\r\nThat said your problem is not in the `tryCatch` function, but in the call that follows directly after `user_link$getElementText()`, which will output a different error, if `tryCatch` function results in an error. \r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to get around this. The simplest one is just skipping the iteration using the `next` operator. In this case it is likely wise to include which iterations succeeded in the `data.frame`.\r\n```R\r\nfor(number in 1:10){\r\n    if(isFALSE(\r\n        tryCatch({\r\n        user_link = suppressMessages(\r\n            remoteDriver$findElement(using = &#39;css selector&#39;, x[number])\r\n        )}, error = function(e) FALSE)\r\n        )\r\n      ) next\r\n    \r\n    user_link = as.character(user_link$getElementText())\r\n\r\n    #Include iteration so we can see which succeeded and which did not.\r\n    commentdf1 = data.frame(user_link, iteration = i)\r\n    commentdf = rbind(commentdf,commentdf1)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nAlternative to including the iteration you could create the entire `data.frame` before-hand, and impute the succesful iterations using `commentdf[i, ] &lt;- user_link`, which would speed up your implementation as well (quite noticable if you have anything more than 20 iterations).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462685/use-trycatch-to-run-on-next-loops-when-detect-error/58464136#58464136","title":"Use trycatch to run on next loops when detect error"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8545877,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/152ad0af03bd64de5f03ea6e34912728?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Geo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8545877/geo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1493,"user_id":11086680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/30128932065c6acbc53c8942947f0aad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11086680/matt"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571491381,"creation_date":1571480589,"last_edit_date":1571487699,"question_id":58462685,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462685","body_markdown":"Trying to write a trycatch function to detect an error.

I assume you meant to ask about the `request` function. Most asynchronous functions call other asynchronous functions to do some work, and then call the callback. You can think of it as a chain of functions and callbacks. This is what the `request` function does. Of course, at least the last function needs to be truly asynchronous, and usually that is a function exported by one of the node built-in modules (`fs`, `http`, ...). It may also be exported by a native module, or using the `worker_threads` module in more recent node versions.\r\n\r\n2. The `async` keyword isn&#39;t required for a function to be asynchronous. Marking a function as `async` lets the function use the `await` syntax and makes the function return a Promise implicitly.\r\n\r\nTo better understand how asynchronous code works, you should take a look at how the  [node event loop](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/) works\r\n\r\nNote that I assumed a Node.js environment, because you used `require`, but most of what I said applies to the browser as well: there is a chain of asynchronous functions, and the last one will call one of the built-in functions (for instance `XMLHttpRequest`). The browser environment uses an event loop too, and `async/await` work in the same way","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462670/how-are-callbacks-coded-in-javascript-behind-the-scenes/58462900#58462900","title":"How are callbacks coded in Javascript, behind the scenes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":10886936,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98af9761a72df21a9ec1fbbe836edcca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"beyondtdr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10886936/beyondtdr"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571482250,"creation_date":1571480447,"question_id":58462670,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462670","body_markdown":"How does a function know that something is a callback; something that needs to be executed once certain prior I/O has completed. How does it know that it shouldn&#39;t execute right away? Is it defined in a function in a (standardized) way?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know the &#39;callback&#39; keyword that is often used in an argument is just common practise, but does not automatically let the function interpret the argument as something that should start once certain I/O has completed.\r\n\r\nTaking the below example, I have two questions (taken from https://medium.com/codebuddies/getting-to-know-asynchronous-javascript-callbacks-promises-and-async-await-17e0673281ee):\r\n\r\n    const request = require(‘request’);\r\n    function handleResponse(error, response, body){\r\n        if(error){\r\n            // Handle error.\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n            // Successful, do something with the result.\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    request(&#39;https://www.somepage.com&#39;, handleResponse);\r\n\r\n1. What does the structure of the &#39;require&#39; function look like so that it knows that argument 2 (handleResponse in this case) should be executed once the request has completed? I guess this gets down to the same question that I asked above.\r\n\r\n2. Can functions be asynchronous even without the async keyword in the function? If yes, how does the browser know it&#39;s an asynchronous function?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462670/how-are-callbacks-coded-in-javascript-behind-the-scenes","title":"How are

The only problem is that you will have to make the &lt;input&gt; element wider than two characters because the up and down arrows needs some space inside of the input box as well. Try readjusting the width to `2em` instead of `2.5em` and you will see what I mean.  \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58462641/define-the-size-for-input-type-number/58462814#58462814","title":"Define the size for &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt;"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11715706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GFYRqt4dJ0E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc0UL2cef90UvmHBQ-5iU0WF9HzBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mostafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715706/mostafa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11715706,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GFYRqt4dJ0E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc0UL2cef90UvmHBQ-5iU0WF9HzBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mostafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11715706/mostafa"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58462814,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571494775,"creation_date":1571480245,"last_edit_date":1571494775,"question_id":58462641,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58462641","body_markdown":"I&#39;m setting up a simple HTML interface with `&lt;input type=&quot;number&quot;&gt;` in it.
