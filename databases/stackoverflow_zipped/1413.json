What this means is that the `Activity` can pause &amp; stop before it ever shows up on the screen.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t `finish()` the `Activity`, it&#39;ll usually `onResume()` a second time, and everything will be fine.

There is going to be Paid and Unpaid customers. For Unpaid customers, I want to provide few videos as free access for selected training package. \r\n\r\nFor example, if there is total 10 training videos in a given training package, 4 videos are going to be free. But, to view remaining 6 videos, customer needs to purchase whole training package.\r\n\r\nI am not able to decide proper approach to design database tables for this scenario. \r\n\r\nHere is what I can think of. I am not sure this is going to be correct approach.\r\n\r\n**First Approach:**\r\nI am assuming, I need three tables like below:\r\n\r\n - Customer Table (Columns: customer_id, customer info)\r\n - Training Video Table (Columns: video_id, video url, free_access as boolean)\r\n - Purchase Table (columns: Customer_id as foreign key, video_id as Foreign Key) \r\n\r\nWhen user accessing any training video, I will check if the user is paid or unpaid. For this I will take help of Purchase_table. Then on the basis of boolean free_access column, video will be served/denied. But, this seems too costly performance wise (I might be wrong on this!).\r\n\r\n**Second Approach:** \r\nI should create view on top of Training Video Table for Paid and Unpaid users to minimise access of videos for unpaid users. But, I am not sure how this is going to be implemented.\r\n\r\nShould I go with approach one with some caching mechanism to avoid querying Purchase table for every video request. Do you think it is OK or can suggest any new approach.\r\n\r\nAny help will be appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205897/database-design-approach-suggestions-needed","title":"Database design approach: suggestions needed"},{"tags":["mapbox","choropleth"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12154344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YzrI7GR3T9w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcA/FLlO6rIy9lc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sandro Loch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154344/sandro-loch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12154344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-YzrI7GR3T9w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAcA/FLlO6rIy9lc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sandro Loch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154344/sandro-loch"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570041829,"creation_date":1570034882,"last_edit_date":1570041829,"question_id":58205894,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205894","body_markdown":"How can I change the bar to color subtitles? \r\n\r\nFor example similar: \r\n[enter image description here][1]\r\n\r\nI am using this:.\r\n```\r\ncolorscale = [&#39;rgb(0,255,0)&#39;, &#39;rgb(255,255,0)&#39;, &#39;rgb(255,128,0)&#39;, &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]\r\ndata_text = &quot;{} : {} Habitantes.&quot;.format(data_nome, data_pop)\r\n\r\nfig = go.Figure(\r\n    go.Choroplethmapbox(\r\n        geojson=geojson_rj, \r\n        locations=df_rj.municipio_geocodigo, \r\n        z=df_rj.level_alert,\r\n        text=data_text,\r\n        hoverinfo=&quot;text&quot;,\r\n        zmin=0,\r\n        zmax=3,\r\n        marker_opacity=0.5,\r\n        marker_line_width=1,\r\n        colorscale=colorscale, \r\n        autocolorscale=False   \r\n    ))     \r\n\r\nfig.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\n [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5K9f.png\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205894/how-can-insert-legend-for-color-in-go-choroplethmapbox","title":"How can insert legend for color in go.Choroplethmapbox?"},{"tags":["outlook","phpmailer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21601,"user_id":333340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EUElo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Synchro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/333340/synchro"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570039855,"post_id":58205893,"comment_id":102792122,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205893/how-to-create-winmail-dat-for-email-created-with-phpmailer-with-voting-buttons#comment102792122_58205893"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7516609,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b14032937ab4df2a479ee503027c2595?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mdrmdr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7516609/mdrmdr"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570034882,"creation_date":1570034882,"question_id":58205893,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205893","body_markdown":"\r\nI&#39;m creating HTML/CSS e-mails with PHP &amp; PHPmailer and send them via a SMTP server only within a company network only to users with Outlook clients.

need some expert help. \r\n\r\nJust to give you a quick rundown of what the form is and what I&#39;d like it to do:\r\n\r\n - Rental quote form.\r\n - The customer should be able to select different furniture pieces and input desired quantities.\r\n - When the form is submitted, the most important data (besides the customer&#39;s contact info) is the item&#39;s name, that item&#39;s ID number (which is supplied as meta data\r\n   from that item&#39;s post in WP), and the quantity of that specific item.\r\n\r\nNow the trickiest part I&#39;ve come across is trying to group the data for the item name, id, and quantity. And secondly, trying to render it nicely in the email that gets sent to the client.

I&#39;m basically learning form processing as I go. This is very much a prototype as you can see by the commented out parts I wanted to keep around for reference. Those will be removed in the final code. \r\n\r\nRight now I&#39;m passing the ID numbers as a hidden input, which isn&#39;t great because all the id inputs are getting included in the final rendering. I know that&#39;s the nature of a hidden input, but I couldn&#39;t come up with a better solution. Any suggestions there?\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to group these values (checkbox, text input, and supplied value) together and render them? I feel like my loop could be way better. Or maybe there&#39;s a better way to include more data values into the inputs themselves?\r\n\r\nThis is all working by the way, I&#39;m able to submit the form and get an email:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1] \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/C5sny.jpg\r\n\r\nBut as you can see the formatting is not great. As mentioned before I&#39;m getting all the hidden values (for example that &quot;ID number: 35&quot; is from a non-selected item), and I&#39;m also unable to add the text &quot;Quantity&quot; in front of it&#39;s corresponding value without completely breaking the loop. So right now it&#39;s just the number that was entered in the form. \r\n\r\nAny help and/or advice would be greatly appreciated! If you need any more info just let me know.

Unfortunately I had like 3 of them. In addition, if you don&#39;t want them to be sanitized, you have to use a service called `DomSanitizer`and use the method `bypassSecurityTrustScript` ([doc][2]) passing the script as a parameter.

The latter tells you that the x should be a list with increasing values of its elements.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205839/how-to-get-the-matrix-output-from-the-function/58205993#58205993","title":"How to get the matrix output from the function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11117887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c30423411aa26662b1d7144e553d98d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"killer croc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11117887/killer-croc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58205993,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570036116,"creation_date":1570034637,"last_edit_date":1570036116,"question_id":58205839,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205839","body_markdown":"I have been trying to figure out how to use this function but cannot seem to get the `x` input to do anything.

[Certain styles][1] are inherited from parent elements.\r\n\r\n[Specificity][2] has to do with which CSS rules take precedence over other CSS rules.

am working with a demo Django project of video blog that I have hosted on a local Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS with Gunicorn, Nginx, Redis and Postgresql. I have installed this server on Virtualbox and assigned a fixed IP. Static files (html, css, js) are working well but video and a default image file of media folder are not showing. Both static and media folders are in the project root directory. I think have not configured properly the Nginx configuration file.

Further oddness on visual studio&#39;s part, you don&#39;t appear to be able to add back the PNG targets, so if you delete them they&#39;re gone forever unless you have an external ICO editor (which I assume would mean you wouldn&#39;t be using the VS one anyway).\r\n\r\nYour best bet if you&#39;re committed to continuing in VS (several free websites available that will do this for you given some images) is to clear out the unused versions, and add BMP targets for the sizes you care about. The max for BMP is 24 bit, so be aware, but you should be able to keep a fair amount of fidelity, and still keep your transparency (there is a transparent color, and if you paste in with transparency the editor will automatically fill that in for you) - all while keeping the same sizes as the PNG targets.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!\r\n[![Example icon][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OwgRO.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205802/how-do-i-edit-the-ico-file-visual-studio-creates-for-me/58205985#58205985","title":"How do I edit the ico file Visual Studio creates for me?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":4816663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-_97xiAyOrTQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAXs/SOfQ8eKKt_Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric Folland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4816663/eric-folland"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58205985,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570035640,"creation_date":1570034510,"question_id":58205802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205802","body_markdown":"In Solution Explorer, Right click -&gt; Add...

For this game, I have weapons that have different properties (stats like damage and intelligence, hands occupied, etc.) that work fine. \r\n\r\nItem Class (base class)\r\n\r\n    public class Item\r\n    {\r\n        // stats and getters / setters\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nWeapon Class\r\n\r\n    public class Weapon : Item\r\n    {\r\n        public void Attack()\r\n        {\r\n            // attack enemies and reduce their health\r\n            // I want the Effect method to activate when attacking, \r\n            // if the method has been implementd\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would like to be able to create different methods on run time that are able to execute effects, like for example dealing more damage when hitting an enemy. However, I would like to implement these methods on run time based on an index that corresponds to an effect. The reason is that weapons are stored in a json file, and when parsing it this index will help identify which effect a weapon has. So, if the index is 1, the implementation should allow the weapon to deal the extra damage, but if it is 2, it will have a different effect. For this, I have created a OnHit class and a IOnHit interface like this:\r\n\r\n    public class OnHit : IOnHit\r\n    {\r\n        public void Effect()\r\n        {\r\n            // empty\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    public interface IOnHit\r\n    {\r\n        void Effect();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n I am looking for a way to make that happen dynamically. One way I thought of doing this was to have a static class with all effects and then passing the index there and continuing. However, that would be problematic for the game as it would have to loop through a switch case every time the player attacks (or 2, if the player has 2 weapons). So, I am looking for a way to have an interface or an abstract class with abstract methods that can be implemented once, and then called whenever the effects of the weapon happens. My idea was to create an instance of the OnHit class inside the weapon object and link the IOnHit interface there. Then, to implement the code inside it like this:\r\n\r\n    public class Weapon : Item\r\n    {\r\n        OnHit oh = new OnHit();\r\n        IOnHit ioh = oh;\r\n        public void Attack()\r\n        {\r\n            // previous attack method\r\n            if(ioh.Effect is implemented)\r\n                ioh.Effect();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void SetIndex(int index)\r\n        {\r\n            switch{\r\n                case 1:\r\n                    ioh.Effect()\r\n                    {\r\n                        // implementation of the effect\r\n                    }\r\n                break;\r\n\r\n                case 2:\r\n                    ioh.Effect()\r\n                    {\r\n                        // implementation of different effect\r\n                    }\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nwhere the index parameter is the id of the effect, drawn from the parsed json.\r\n\r\nThank you again.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205779/c-implement-abstract-or-interface-method-inside-of-another-method","title":"C# - Implement abstract or interface method inside of another method"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-mvc","razor","razor-pages","razor-class-library"],"owner":{"reputation":34681,"user_id":869621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7ab9817b53b7e7b0e735528bc9c2372?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kevin Gosse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/869621/kevin-gosse"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570034410,"creation_date":1570034410,"question_id":58205775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205775","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a web application where pages need to be populated from other projects.

Let me explain what I am trying to do: I have three different classes of objects: users, magazines, and articles. A user can be subscribed to many magazines. All articles belong to a unique magazine. Below are the models I use:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass User(db.Model):\r\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n    name = db.Column( db.String(64) )\r\n    subscriptions= db.relationship(&#39;Magazine&#39;, secondary=subs, backref=db.backref(&#39;subscribers&#39;, lazy=&#39;dynamic&#39;), lazy=&#39;dynamic&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Magazine(db.Model):\r\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n    name = db.Column(db.String(64))\r\n    articles= db.relationship(&#39;Article&#39;, backref=&#39;magazine&#39;, lazy=&#39;dynamic&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nclass Article(db.Model):\r\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\r\n    title = db.Column(db.String(64))\r\n    abstract = db.Column(db.String(64))\r\n    magazine_id= db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(&#39;magazine.id&#39;))\r\n\r\nsubs = db.Table(&#39;subs&#39;, \r\n    db.Column(&#39;user_id&#39;, db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(&#39;user.id&#39;)),\r\n    db.Column(&#39;magazine_id&#39;, db.Integer, db.ForeignKey(&#39;magazine.id&#39;))\r\n)\r\n```\r\nThe subs table is there to keep record of the subscriptions.What I need to do is, for a given user, retrieve all the articles of the magazines to which she is subscribed.\r\n\r\nI know how to make it work in python, let&#39;s say user1 is a user:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\narticles=[]\r\nfor m in user1.subscriptions:\r\n    articles+=m.articles.all()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I need to do it from SQLAlchemy because I want to filter the articles (read/unread, date of publication, themes ecc) and paginate the results. I can do it from a mysql shell with the statement at the beginning of the post but I fail misarebly when trying to do it from SQLAlchemy:\r\n\r\n```\r\nuser1.subscriptions.join(Article).filter(Article.magazine_id==id).all()\r\n```\r\ngives the error:\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: &#39;builtin_function_or_method&#39; object has no attribute &#39;translate&#39;\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205773/from-sql-syntax-to-sqlalchemy-syntax","title":"from SQL syntax to SQLAlchemy syntax"},{"tags":["powershell","registry","regedit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":10350118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FSa_hGMFN5w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABCE/Ae__h_35PSE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"techguy1029","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10350118/techguy1029"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570035206,"post_id":58205772,"comment_id":102790035,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205772/powershell-to-add-reg-key#comment102790035_58205772"},{"owner":{"reputation":308,"user_id":1921826,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/590a37833c2b2844cdecf0a96a3cc740?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BigRedEO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1921826/bigredeo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":437,"user_id":10350118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FSa_hGMFN5w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABCE/Ae__h_35PSE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"techguy1029","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10350118/techguy1029"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570035333,"post_id":58205772,"comment_id":102790089,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205772/powershell-to-add-reg-key#comment102790089_58205772"},{"owner":{"reputation":437,"user_id":10350118,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FSa_hGMFN5w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABCE/Ae__h_35PSE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"techguy1029","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10350118/techguy1029"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570035429,"post_id":58205772,"comment_id":102790144,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205772/powershell-to-add-reg-key#comment102790144_58205772"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":308,"user_id":1921826,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/590a37833c2b2844cdecf0a96a3cc740?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BigRedEO","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1921826/bigredeo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570035279,"creation_date":1570035279,"answer_id":58205992,"question_id":58205772,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205992","body_markdown":"What I finally tested and got working was:\r\n\r\n```cmd /c &#39;reg add &quot;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server&quot; /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f&#39; | Out-File $log -append```\r\n\r\nI realize that&#39;s going around the Powershell option, but it&#39;s what I got to work for now.

I&#39;ve had the problem that I had put the method in which if the button is pressed... inside the `onCreate`, and then when it was not pressed the app crashed.\r\n\r\nThe method `Clicado` is not coded correctly as it is the method I tried to do myself in which I&#39;ve included the if and the `onClickListener`.\r\n\r\nAny idea of how to do it please?\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205758/how-to-make-an-if-which-depends-on-a-button-pressed-or-not","title":"How to make an IF which depends on a button pressed or not?"},{"tags":["fritzbox"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2103,"user_id":3788685,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0153b937db548cca172e6a78e71eabe3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3788685","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788685/user3788685"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570854998,"post_id":58205756,"comment_id":103056186,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics#comment103056186_58205756"},{"owner":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2103,"user_id":3788685,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0153b937db548cca172e6a78e71eabe3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3788685","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3788685/user3788685"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570912844,"post_id":58205756,"comment_id":103069254,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics#comment103069254_58205756"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570377922,"post_id":58247191,"comment_id":102886684,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58247191#comment102886684_58247191"},{"owner":{"reputation":27028,"user_id":549372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc12ae5f4b59645f0fbfde098c306756?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin Zeitler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549372/martin-zeitler"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570378388,"post_id":58247191,"comment_id":102886808,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58247191#comment102886808_58247191"},{"owner":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570634377,"post_id":58247191,"comment_id":102976473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58247191#comment102976473_58247191"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":27028,"user_id":549372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc12ae5f4b59645f0fbfde098c306756?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin Zeitler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549372/martin-zeitler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27028,"user_id":549372,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc12ae5f4b59645f0fbfde098c306756?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Martin Zeitler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549372/martin-zeitler"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570272637,"last_edit_date":1570272637,"creation_date":1570269411,"answer_id":58247191,"question_id":58205756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58247191","body_markdown":"Router devices alike AVM Fritz!Box offer a protocol called [TR-064](https://avm.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Global/Service/Schnittstellen/AVM_TR-064_first_steps.pdf), which permits retrieving statistics. In general, you&#39;d need to write a `SOAP` client, because this is the base for the `TR-064` protocol. Not sure if this would offer the granularity, as you demand it - but it&#39;s the only interface available to obtain statistics. There&#39;s also `TR-069`, but this is intended for provisioning from the provider side. Calling `#96*7*` would enable Telnet and `#96*8*` disables it, in order gain terminal access, when one wants to edit configuration files (but the web surface might show an &quot;unsupported changes&quot; warning then).\r\n\r\n ---\r\n\r\nBut as you describe the situation, there might be an easier way: In case you use any one machine running Windows 10, this might explain the seemingly unexplained upstream traffic. Go to `Settings` &gt; `Update &amp; Security` &gt; `Windows Update` &gt; `Advanced Options` &gt; `Choose how updates are delivered` and set the one switch there to `Off` - or select `PCs on my local network`. Then this machine will not participate in their P2P Windows updates, or at least not upload them to random machines on the internet anymore. Repeat this with every single machine, which is running Windows 10. Other P2P clients might cause similar upstream traffic, but with Windows 10 this does not necessarily imply illegal activity on your network. Without much upstream traffic, the speed of the downstream traffic should also improve (assuming this is an A-DSL or V-DSL connect; S-DSL is unlikely given).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58247191#58247191","title":"Monitoring routed traffic statistics"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570909606,"post_id":58349613,"comment_id":103068568,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58349613#comment103068568_58349613"},{"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":12063049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c59293b8491c66c6a11d1412b29b016?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blubase","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063049/blubase"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1880,"user_id":42429,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjtn1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Cowie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/42429/martin-cowie"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570966252,"post_id":58349613,"comment_id":103077527,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205756/monitoring-routed-traffic-statistics/58349613#comment103077527_58349613"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":12063049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c59293b8491c66c6a11d1412b29b016?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blubase","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063049/blubase"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570837324,"creation_date":1570837324,"answer_id":58349613,"question_id":58205756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58349613","body_markdown":"It seems many Fritz!Boxes do have a hidden [Wireshark][2] sniffer as a debug service [http://fritz.box/html/capture.html][1].

So I am trying to get my head around what it *can* achieve.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205752/trying-to-understand-the-advantages-of-calling-a-function-via-a-javascript-custo","title":"Trying to understand the advantages of calling a function via a javascript CustomEvent over calling a function directly"},{"tags":["google-cloud-storage"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":461,"user_id":11475279,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hmXFY.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"eespinola","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11475279/eespinola"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570109482,"post_id":58205749,"comment_id":102816320,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205749/how-to-get-iam-policy-for-all-buckets-and-objects-in-gcs#comment102816320_58205749"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e089250bfeb6c3c633ed19aeaa844fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mvir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154908/mvir"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570034311,"creation_date":1570034311,"question_id":58205749,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205749","body_markdown":"i need to get IAM policy details for each object in each bucket for all GCP projects to determine if the object is Public or not. currently the security policy is not a Bucket level and there are thousands of files/objects in each bucket.

I am able to create events and specify any parameter except for attendees.\r\n\r\nA couple notes:\r\n\r\n- We have a g suite license and are well within our quota.\r\n- The service account has write access to the calendar.\r\n- I have tried only adding attendees within my own domain and this does not fix the problem.\r\n- I have tried not sending email notifications and get the same response.\r\n- All events are being added to the same calendar.\r\n- Requests with no attendees work completely fine.\r\n- I&#39;ve seen this page: https://support.google.com/a/answer/2905486?hl=en and assumed that I just needed to let my requests refresh. However, after waiting out the weekend I came back and still got the error message.\r\n- When the message persisted I created a new project in the google developer console with a new service account. This project was also made using a different email (this email belonged to an admin) under the same domain. The first request on the project resulted in the same error. \r\n    - The original project made ~500 requests over the course of 3 days during testing. Most of these requests were made in a javascript application. I was able to add attendees in these events. I eventually switched the requests to the backend with a service account and have yet to be able to add attendees since then.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the code I am using to generate the Event. Get Attendees just returns a list of EventAttendees for each email in a list.\r\n```\r\nvar attendees = GetAttendees(request.Emails);\r\n\r\nvar googleEvent = new Event()\r\n{\r\n    Summary = request.Title,\r\n    Location = request.Location,\r\n    Description = request.Description,\r\n    Start = new EventDateTime()\r\n    {\r\n        DateTime = request.MeetingDate,\r\n        TimeZone = &quot;America/Chicago&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    End = new EventDateTime()\r\n    {\r\n        DateTime = request.EndTime,\r\n        TimeZone = &quot;America/Chicago&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    Attendees = attendees\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting any request with attendees results in the following response:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;error&quot;: &quot;Google.Apis.Requests.RequestError\\r\\nCalendar usage limits exceeded.

Code\r\n--\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Function {\r\n\r\n    @FunctionName(&quot;StroageEventGrid&quot;)\r\n    @StorageAccount(&quot;AzureWebJobsStorage&quot;)\r\n    public void run(@EventGridTrigger(name = &quot;blobeventgrid&quot;) EventSchema event, \r\n                    @BlobInput(name = &quot;blob&quot;,dataType = &quot;binary&quot;,path = &quot;{data.url}&quot;) byte[] content,\r\n                    final ExecutionContext context) \r\n    {\r\n        context.getLogger().info((String)event.data.get(&quot;url&quot;));\r\n        if(content != null)\r\n            context.getLogger().info(&quot;Length: &quot; + content.length);\r\n        else\r\n            context.getLogger().info(&quot;Content is null&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class EventSchema {\r\n\r\n  public String topic;\r\n  public String subject;\r\n  public String eventType;\r\n  public Date eventTime;\r\n  public String id;\r\n  public String dataVersion;\r\n  public String metadataVersion;\r\n  public Map&lt;String, Object&gt; data;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Check the AzureWebJobsStorage connectiong string in application settings\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nMake sure that it is the correct connection string of your target storage account. \r\n\r\n3. Upload a new blob\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nYou can see that I get the right result. \r\n\r\nSo, I suggest you check your connection string setting. By default, your local test settings will not update to the cloud, which may causes this issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOYzM.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/h84pD.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205740/blob-access-from-event-grid-azure-function-using-java-api/58264666#58264666","title":"Blob access from event grid azure function using Java API"}],"owner":{"reputation":358,"user_id":1695807,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e13d6a5e3259a229d76549844895d089?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RST","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1695807/rst"},"last_editor":{"reputation":358,"user_id":1695807,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e13d6a5e3259a229d76549844895d089?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RST","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1695807/rst"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":109,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58264666,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570431045,"creation_date":1570034264,"last_edit_date":1570302156,"question_id":58205740,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205740","body_markdown":"**Background**\r\n\r\nJava Azure functions 2, using blob storage with event grid subsription for blob create events which the function (see below) is bound to via the event trigger.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nNot clear how to **bind a blob** (See `@BlobInput` Java annotation) Input Blob Binding from Azure functions which the [documentation][1] illudes to, but not sure if possible in the Java API, unlike its C# counterpart. \r\n\r\nWhen the function is invocked nothing is bound to the `content` varaible using the `@BlobInput` annotation, so once the line is reached where the `content` variable is reached, it results in a null pointer.  \r\n\r\nThe `path = &quot;{data.url}&quot;` based on documentation allows you to access event data passed to the function.

Having spent the last week or so since the official release of dotnetcore3, I&#39;ve tried to get something up and running that uses a SPA framework.\r\n\r\nGiven there has been no answers for this and I am keen to get SPA services running for `aspnetcore3` I have looked into the various templates supplied within Visual Studio.  Currently the templates are `Angular` and `React` that use `aspnetcore3`.\r\n\r\nPrior to this there are templates for `Angular`, `React` and also `Aurelia`.  For me Aurelia looks great - vanilla typescript bindings.  So I am trying to go down that route.\r\n\r\nI managed to get `HMR` (Hot Module Replacement) working.  I built an Aurelia project using the CLI.  However, my project has a lot of configuration, and I am still learning `WebPack`.  HMR does not currently work with Aurelia CSS.\r\n\r\nFor my scenario, I had the client app loaded in VS Code.  I created an aspnet core project which then hooks into webpack.  \r\n\r\nI know you are asking specifically about React, but the concept could be the same.\r\n\r\n## Some code\r\n\r\nYou can find my code here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/andez2000/spa-apps/tree/master/aurelia-cli/e1/aurelia-app\r\n\r\nNOTE: Currently I am just dumping stuff into this repo.  There are projects created from the templates if you navigate to the top level.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n1. Open folder `spa-apps\\aurelia-cli\\e1\\aurelia-app` in `VSCode`\r\n2. Open the `project.csproj` in `VS2019`\r\n3. Open a terminal in `VSCode` and run `npm start -- --hmr` and wait for output to complete.\r\n4. Compile and run the solution in `VS2019`\r\n\r\nThis should open the default browser and load the index.ejs.\r\n\r\n### Things to note\r\n\r\nThe port numbers in the dotnet project and the aurelia project must tie up.\r\n\r\n__Startup.cs__\r\n\r\n``` \r\npublic void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)\r\n{\r\n    ...\r\n    app.UseSpa(spa =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n\t\t\r\n        if (env.IsDevelopment())\r\n        {\r\n            spa.UseProxyToSpaDevelopmentServer(&quot;http://localhost:5000&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n__aurelia.json__\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &quot;platform&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;hmr&quot;: false,\r\n    &quot;open&quot;: false,\r\n    &quot;port&quot;: 5000,\r\n    &quot;host&quot;: &quot;localhost&quot;,\r\n    &quot;output&quot;: &quot;wwwroot/dist&quot;\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo maybe this is conceptually the same as React.  For some reason my React template fails to connect to IIS Express - and it worked the other day - so not really in a position to go digging.\r\n\r\nFor me, this project has a lot of moving parts.  I wish I had a minimal working solution - that comprises webpack + scss + some spa framework + dotnetcore3.

And then based on a threshold value set all black sections to 0 and white sections to 255.\r\n\r\nI know that whites, blacks and greys all have similar &lt;x,x,x&gt; bgr values so surely there should be a way to do this.\r\n\r\nThanks and sorry for not being able to link the images directly I don&#39;t have enough points.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.imgur.com/8CFj2j4.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6r9lD.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.imgur.com/0hfSa20.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205730/set-all-coloured-pixels-in-an-image-to-bright255-opencv","title":"Set all coloured pixels in an image to Bright[255]?, OpenCV"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays","javascript-objects"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18295,"user_id":2026606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ksr3L.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tyler Roper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2026606/tyler-roper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570037471,"post_id":58205727,"comment_id":102791072,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205727/how-to-take-each-element-out-of-an-array-and-make-each-element-a-key-in-an-objec#comment102791072_58205727"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10381,"user_id":6766919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bxq3H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ellipsis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6766919/ellipsis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570034430,"creation_date":1570034430,"answer_id":58205787,"question_id":58205727,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205787","body_markdown":"Use `forEach` loop and your object was in a wrong format\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const groups = [{name: &#39;group1&#39;, values: [&#39;value1&#39;]},{name:&#39; group2&#39;, values: [&#39;value2&#39;, &#39;value3&#39;]}]\r\n    var obj={};\r\n    groups.forEach(e=&gt;{\r\n    e.values.forEach(x=&gt;obj[x]=0)\r\n    })\r\n    console.log(obj)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205727/how-to-take-each-element-out-of-an-array-and-make-each-element-a-key-in-an-objec/58205787#58205787","title":"How to take each element out of an array and make each element a key in an object?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28141,"user_id":9624435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/h44B4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Code Maniac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9624435/code-maniac"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570036479,"creation_date":1570036479,"answer_id":58206245,"question_id":58205727,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58206245","body_markdown":"You can use [`Object.fromEntries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/fromEntries)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const groups = [{name: &#39;group1&#39;, values: [&#39;value1&#39;]},{name: &#39;group2&#39;, values: [&#39;value2&#39;, &#39;value3&#39;]}]\r\n\r\n    const allGroups = Object.fromEntries(groups.flatMap(({\r\n      values\r\n    }) =&gt; values.map(v =&gt; [v, 0])))\r\n\r\n    console.log(allGroups)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205727/how-to-take-each-element-out-of-an-array-and-make-each-element-a-key-in-an-objec/58206245#58206245","title":"How to take each element out of an array and make each element a key in an object?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":3115653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fe794a92962cebda6ac6ad6083545b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"a_nain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3115653/a-nain"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570036635,"creation_date":1570036635,"answer_id":58206279,"question_id":58205727,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58206279","body_markdown":"You&#39;re on the right track, flatMap should give you a falttened array containing values.

It does print &quot;Joining channel&quot; but that&#39;s it.\r\n\r\n    import os\r\n    from dotenv import load_dotenv\r\n    from discord.ext import commands\r\n    import discord\r\n    import random\r\n    import datetime\r\n    \r\n    load_dotenv()\r\n    TOKEN = os.getenv(&#39;DISCORD_TOKEN&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix=&quot;!&quot;)\r\n    client = discord.Client()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.event\r\n    async def on_ready():\r\n        print(f&quot;{bot.user.name} has connected to Discord!&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.command(name=&quot;speak&quot;, help=&quot;The bot speaks...&quot;)\r\n    async def say_something(ctx):\r\n        answers = [\r\n            &quot;Hi there!&quot;,\r\n            &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;,\r\n            &quot;How are you doing?&quot;\r\n        ]\r\n    \r\n        response = random.choice(answers)\r\n        await ctx.send(response)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.command(name=&quot;roll_dice&quot;, help=&quot;It rolles {x} number of dice with {y} amount of sides!&quot;)\r\n    async def roll(ctx, number_of_dice: int, number_of_sides: int):\r\n        dice = [\r\n            str(random.choice(range(1, number_of_sides + 1)))\r\n            for _ in range(number_of_dice)\r\n        ]\r\n        await ctx.send(&quot;, &quot;.join(dice))\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.command(name=&quot;create_channel&quot;, help=&quot;Creates a text channel!&quot;)\r\n    @commands.has_role(&quot;admin&quot;)\r\n    async def create_channel(ctx, channel_name):\r\n        guild = ctx.guild\r\n        existing_channel = discord.utils.get(guild.channels, name=channel_name)\r\n        if not existing_channel:\r\n            print(f&quot;Creating a new channel: {channel_name}&quot;)\r\n            await guild.create_text_channel(channel_name)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.command(name=&quot;time&quot;, help=&quot;Tells you the time...&quot;)\r\n    @commands.has_role(&quot;admin&quot;)\r\n    async def time(ctx):\r\n        current_time = datetime.datetime.strftime(datetime.datetime.now(), &quot;%H:%M, %Y-%m-%d&quot;)\r\n        await ctx.send(current_time)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.command(name=&quot;join_channel&quot;, help=&quot;Makes the bot join a channel!&quot;, aliases=[&quot;join&quot;])\r\n    async def join(ctx):\r\n        print(&quot;Joining channel&quot;)\r\n        author = ctx.message.author\r\n        channel = author.voice.voice_channel\r\n        vc = await channel.connect(reconnect=True)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @bot.event\r\n    async def on_command_error(ctx, error):\r\n        if isinstance(error, commands.errors.CheckFailure):\r\n            await ctx.send(&quot;You do not have the correct role for this command...&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    bot.run(TOKEN)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58205713/discord-bot-doesnt-join-voice-channel-how-can-i-fix-this","title":"Discord Bot doesn&#39;t join voice channel, how can i fix this?"},{"tags":["regex","apache","web-crawler","nutch2"],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12154911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d442c73b2cc0301052527cca9436a528?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154911/khan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12154911,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d442c73b2cc0301052527cca9436a528?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154911/khan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570179921,"creation_date":1570034138,"last_edit_date":1570179921,"question_id":58205711,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58205711","body_markdown":"I am new to crawling and specially apache nutch.
