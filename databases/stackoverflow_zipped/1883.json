You&#39;ll see that the body of both methods is the same\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can&#39;t make the `Sq3` function behave like `Sq4`, because `Sq4` on the other hand is a  Func-typed *field* that holds the `x =&gt; x * x` delegate. `Sq3` on the other hand is a function that returns a `Func`, a common idiom in functional programming.\r\n\r\nYou can use `Sq4` as if it were a function, eg :\r\n\r\n    var result=Sq4(2);\r\n\r\nAs for Sq3, what you do depends on what you want to do. If you only want to execute the function, use the same syntax as `Sq1` or `Sq2`. If you really want to return a `Func&lt;&gt;` you could use something like this :\r\n\r\n    public Func&lt;int,int&gt; Sq3F()\r\n    {\r\n        return (int i)=&gt;i*i;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd use it like this:\r\n\r\n    var fun=Sq3F();\r\n    var result=fun(4);\r\n\r\n**Why a Func&lt;&gt;?**\r\n\r\nThat doesn&#39;t look like much until you realize you can pass *functions* as parameters and construct complex transformations dynamically, eg :\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Func&lt;int,double&gt; LogF(Func&lt;int,int&gt; fun)\r\n{\r\n    return (int i)=&gt;Math.Log(fun(i));\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar func=LogF(Sq3F());\r\nvar result=func(4);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother common technique is [partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application) - take a function with multiple arguments and produce another one where some of the arguments are fixed. Let&#39;s say you want to create a single-argument Log method that works for a *specific* base, which means you can&#39;t just use `Math.Log(double,double). You could do this :\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Func&lt;double,double&gt; LogN(double N)\r\n{\r\n    return (double d)=&gt;Math.Log(d,N);\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar log5F=LogN(5);\r\nvar result=log5F(5);\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093820/what-is-the-use-of-lambda-in-the-last-function-here/58093904#58093904","title":"What is the use of lambda in the last function here?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1698,"user_id":6480658,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79a2edab9dc17e4c66e1d91ebe7a40f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jamheadart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6480658/jamheadart"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58093904,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569399676,"creation_date":1569398375,"question_id":58093820,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58093820","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to understand Lambda expressions;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve got a basic function `Sq1` which is squaring the number `i`\r\nI can rewrite this with a lambda to oneline it, `Sq2`\r\n\r\nI can also write it like `Sq4` with a Func&lt;&gt;, but I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;d want to\r\n\r\nand furthermore, with `Sq3` I was trying to write the long-hand version of `Sq4` because writing `Sq1` helped me understand what `Sq2` was actually doing\r\n\r\n       public int Sq1(int i)\r\n        {\r\n            return i * i;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public int Sq2(int i) =&gt; i * i;\r\n\r\n        public Func&lt;int, int&gt; Sq3(int i)\r\n        {\r\n            // Not sure what goes here, I don&#39;t want to return a function?\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public Func&lt;int, int&gt; Sq4 = x =&gt; x * x;\r\n\r\nCan anybody help me understand why I&#39;d write the function as per `Sq4` and what this is actually shorthand for?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093820/what-is-the-use-of-lambda-in-the-last-function-here","title":"What is the use of lambda in the last function here?"},{"tags":["android","android-10.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":578,"user_id":8528047,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NjFzHTpL2TU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/0qa122EUUf8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pemba Tamang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8528047/pemba-tamang"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569398490,"post_id":58093815,"comment_id":102579914,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093815/cant-download-zip-file-from-server-for-android-10-api-29#comment102579914_58093815"},{"owner":{"reputation":1222,"user_id":6161443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10201583108135535/picture?type=large","display_name":"Bhavesh Misri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6161443/bhavesh-misri"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":578,"user_id":8528047,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-NjFzHTpL2TU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/0qa122EUUf8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pemba Tamang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8528047/pemba-tamang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569398693,"post_id":58093815,"comment_id":102580011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093815/cant-download-zip-file-from-server-for-android-10-api-29#comment102580011_58093815"}],"owner":{"reputation":1222,"user_id":6161443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10201583108135535/picture?type=large","display_name":"Bhavesh Misri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6161443/bhavesh-misri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569400657,"creation_date":1569398351,"last_edit_date":1569400657,"question_id":58093815,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58093815","body_markdown":"I&#39;m unable to download a zip folder from server for android 10 API 29.

I strongly recommend to create a `store/index.js` and follow the docs from [Nuxt][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://nuxtjs.org/guide/vuex-store#activate-the-store","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093806/vuejs-nuxt-state-should-be-a-method-that-returns-an-object-in-store-store-js/58100111#58100111","title":"VueJS/nuxt &#39;state&#39; should be a method that returns an object in store/store.js"}],"owner":{"reputation":1376,"user_id":4966705,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-33GGBSJvG1o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/l3yn5OOYHKA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4966705/rob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1376,"user_id":4966705,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-33GGBSJvG1o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/l3yn5OOYHKA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4966705/rob"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":83,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58100111,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569419819,"creation_date":1569398309,"last_edit_date":1569400390,"question_id":58093806,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58093806","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to VueJS and confused about the warning from nuxt:\r\n\r\n&gt; &#39;state&#39; should be a method that returns an object in store/store.js\r\n\r\nSo, my store.js contains the following (yes im trying the tutorial from the documentation):\r\n\r\n    import Vue from &#39;vue&#39;;\r\n    import Vuex from &#39;vuex&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Vue.use(Vuex);\r\n    export const store = new Vuex.Store({\r\n      state() {\r\n        return {\r\n          todos: [\r\n            { id: 1, text: &#39;...&#39;, done: true },\r\n            { id: 2, text: &#39;...&#39;, done: false }\r\n          ]\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    export default store;\r\n\r\nIsn&#39;t state a method which returns an object?

I studied the HTTP server example given in Netty documentation. But I don&#39;t understand what `DecoderResult` is and how it&#39;s used in the example.  \r\n\r\nWhat I learned so far:  \r\n1. Decoders are to convert bytes to more complex objects. In this case bytes to `HttpRequest`.  \r\n2. In the last `ChannelInboundHandler` (after all decoding is completed) I receive my object (e.g. `HttpRequest`).  \r\n3. The implementation of `channelRead0` method of [`HttpSnoopServerHandler`][1] is quite clear: get the object, down cast, extract information, build the response, and write it when it&#39;s ready.  \r\n\r\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is why checking for the result of decoding (i.e. `appendDecoderResult`) is done at after reading some stuff from the `HttpRequest` object? Shouldn&#39;t I check for such failure before touching `msg`. More generally what happens when the decoding fails?\r\n\r\nFor the record, here&#39;s the part of the code which I&#39;m confused:\r\n&lt;!-- language java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void channelRead0(ChannelHandlerContext ctx, Object msg) throws Exception {\r\n        if (msg instanceof HttpRequest) {\r\n            val request = (HttpRequest) msg;\r\n\r\n            // read all sort of stuff from request\r\n            // and add them to the response buffer;\r\n\r\n            // This is the line confused me :/\r\n            appendDecoderResult(buf, request);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  [1]: https://netty.io/4.1/xref/io/netty/example/http/snoop/HttpSnoopServerHandler.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093792/what-is-netty-decoderresult-and-how-to-use-it","title":"What Is Netty DecoderResult and How to Use It?"},{"tags":["python","scip"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":295,"user_id":6061322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c7794e286d79b07bd081e37e844e302?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NemoMeMeliorEst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6061322/nemomemeliorest"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569398352,"post_id":58093789,"comment_id":102579852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093789/no-module-named-pyscipopt#comment102579852_58093789"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12117478,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD6HTNuM4Ev9ZPoo5akg04eeuu9o8fDdiCYQg66UQ=k-s128","display_name":"NAM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12117478/nam"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":295,"user_id":6061322,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c7794e286d79b07bd081e37e844e302?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NemoMeMeliorEst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6061322/nemomemeliorest"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569402411,"post_id":58093789,"comment_id":102582048,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093789/no-module-named-pyscipopt#comment102582048_58093789"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12117478,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD6HTNuM4Ev9ZPoo5akg04eeuu9o8fDdiCYQg66UQ=k-s128","display_name":"NAM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12117478/nam"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569402494,"post_id":58093918,"comment_id":102582101,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093789/no-module-named-pyscipopt/58093918#comment102582101_58093918"},{"owner":{"reputation":487,"user_id":10035978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vIev.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Kolydas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10035978/alex-kolydas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12117478,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD6HTNuM4Ev9ZPoo5akg04eeuu9o8fDdiCYQg66UQ=k-s128","display_name":"NAM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12117478/nam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569402882,"post_id":58093918,"comment_id":102582340,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093789/no-module-named-pyscipopt/58093918#comment102582340_58093918"},{"owner":{"reputation":2551,"user_id":673271,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zfwXx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mattmilten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/673271/mattmilten"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569403076,"post_id":58093918,"comment_id":102582452,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093789/no-module-named-pyscipopt/58093918#comment102582452_58093918"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":487,"user_id":10035978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9vIev.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Kolydas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10035978/alex-kolydas"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569398782,"creation_date":1569398782,"answer_id":58093918,"question_id":58093789,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58093918","body_markdown":"You probably have more than one versions in your PC.

I mean I don&#39;t want to really delete `myDir` from hard disk and I don&#39;t want to see untracked file `myDir` either on branches (other than branch A) .  \r\n\r\nI know there is `git clean` command, but it deletes files from hard disk, right?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093768/remove-untracked-file-but-not-delete-it-from-hard-disk","title":"remove untracked file but not delete it from hard disk"},{"tags":["python","memory","torch"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12117431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RLuhN3EcMto/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reZe_wQ2SjUOqJrirTBeIhDVndEfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12117431","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12117431/user12117431"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569398185,"creation_date":1569398185,"question_id":58093766,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58093766","body_markdown":"   \r\nPlease note 128, 129, 130 lines   \r\n\r\nI am using memory_profiler but I have some doubts about the memory situation I observed.

conditional type has no reason to work on a tuple, your conditional type basically resolves to the question `[typeof Position, typeof Status] extends Attribute&lt;infer T&gt;` which it clearly does not so you end up with never.\r\n\r\nYou could pass in a union into the type (`AttributeTypes&lt;typeof Position | typeof Status&gt;`) and then you will get `Position[] | Status[]` which is not really what you want

could also use an array in your conditional type (`Attributes extends Array&lt;Attribute&lt;infer T&gt;&gt; ? T[] : never`) but that will not preserve the tuple structure in the input ([Play](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/GYVwdgxgLglg9mABAZwBQEpEG8CwAoRRKATwAcBTRAQSigCcYAjEKcgHgBUzyA+RAXmyIYAEwBcKejDABzADRFuAfglcKiAL4BufPkIl1ABTjIYsBAKEAPCWBABbRuToLith07qadBRABtyKERjU3MwCRopZlY2ELN4MD5BLGFxRAAiUhN4hHTvXV8DSgBlKABDKBBkS3Sy6BgAN3I8gB8M6TrYJvSfQgCg0oqqiNoGaPZByuQkoVEJdORyqbztAv1ualGmFnI1cmQ2SLGd6vIrVjARaqPtmLKwYh4AbQBdGb1CTaiTxDOLq+odDoZWIhy24zY0mAzkQHB4fCUsNeiFs5CadF6iDWinUACV9iA-EFBDdxnsDk8inBgMFsmEFFSaZMqm8sXgNEA))\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way to get the output you want is to use a mapped type. Mapped types preserve tuple while allowing you to map every element type of a tuple to a new element type in the resulting tuple:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\ntype Attribute&lt;Type&gt; = { id: string, type?: Type };\r\n\r\ntype Position = { x: number, y: number };\r\nlet Position: Attribute&lt;Position&gt; = { id: &quot;position&quot; };\r\n\r\ntype Status = &quot;active&quot; | &quot;inactive&quot;;\r\nlet Status: Attribute&lt;Status&gt; = { id: &quot;status&quot; };\r\n\r\ntype AttributeTypes&lt;Attributes extends Attribute&lt;any&gt;[]&gt; = {\r\n  [P in keyof Attributes]: Attributes[P] extends Attribute&lt;infer T&gt; ?

calls work fine with flask-executor (no Loky) :)\r\n\r\nThe problem comes when trying to call an opencv function like `knnMatch`.\r\n\r\nIf Loky fixes the opencv issue, I wonder if it can be made to

I thought about creating the reverses of my sequence, however, I&#39;m not sure how to integrate it into my list of rules:\r\n\r\n    re.findall(regex, v) or re.findall(regex, v[::-1]) \r\n  \r\nI also want to add more conditions like if the first 10 letters contain a certain letter, how can I do that without cluttering my code? \r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    database={&#39;key&#39;, &#39;MSCPFSPKQPGFGHFREPTTRSSVAKVIERNSGALIVFGGAAACVVAGWKVRGYLTDRQLSQL&#39;}\r\n    regex = r&#39;([A-Z]{3}[Y|W|F|I|H][A-Z]P[^YFWHI]{4}[Y|W|F|I|H][A-Z]{3})|([A-Z]{3}[Y|W|F|I|H][^YFWHI]{4}P[A-Z][Y|W|F|I|H][A-Z]{3})&#39;\r\n    \r\n    for k,v in database.items():\r\n        rules = [re.findall(regex, v), 1 &lt; len(v) &lt; 200, len(re.findall(r&#39;W&#39;,v))&lt;4]\r\n        if all(rules):\r\n            print(re.findall(regex, v))\r\n            print(&#39;%s&#39; %k)\r\n            print(&#39;%s&#39; %v)\r\n            print(&#39;%s&#39; %len(v))\r\n            print(&#39;\\n&#39;)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58093714/python-regex-search-pattern-or-string-in-reverse-direction","title":"Python regex search pattern or string in reverse direction"},{"tags":["angular","angular6","jsplumb"],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9349958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94dfb37c76169ba79ffd596d77c429a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sravya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9349958/sravya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9349958,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/94dfb37c76169ba79ffd596d77c429a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sravya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9349958/sravya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569401098,"creation_date":1569397996,"last_edit_date":1569401098,"question_id":58093713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58093713","body_markdown":"I wanted to connect the div&#39;s using a line manually but not with a button.

But before writing a new line in a csv file i want to check if the data is different to make sure i don&#39;t write the same data twice.\r\nThe problem is, i use an array to store the new data, and an array to store the old data. when they are different the code will write a new line in the CSV file and make the old and the new data the same, then new data will change again. But for some reason the old != new is not working in finding if the data is changed.\r\n\r\nI tried using more global variables and no local variables. I tried using the Values Array (all sensors data, also a lot of 0) in stead of the Info Array (active sensor data).

(Coincidences / (Coincidences + Discordance)) \r\n\r\nSo my resulting matrix is an symmetrical one with dim 4x4 and diagonal elements equal 0, so in the example my A(1,2) would it be:\r\n\r\n    A(1,2) = 1 - (2 / 4) = 0.5\r\n    A(1,3) = 1 - (0/4) = 1.0\r\n\r\nAnd so on...\r\n\r\nI have created a function to generate this matrix:\r\n\r\n    cs_matrix &lt;- function (x) {\r\n      \r\n      cs.mat &lt;- matrix(rep(0,dim(x)[1]^2), ncol = dim(x)[1])\r\n      \r\n      for (i in 1:dim(x)[1]){\r\n        \r\n        for (j in 1:dim(x)[1]){\r\n          \r\n          cs.mat[i,j] &lt;- 1 -
