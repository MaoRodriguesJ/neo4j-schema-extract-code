It takes code (a Julia expression) as input and spits out code (a different Julia expression).\r\n\r\nWhy is this useful? It has multiple purposes:\r\n\r\n* **compile time copy-and-paste**: You don&#39;t have to write the same piece of code multiple times but instead can define a short macro that writes it for you wherever you put it. ([example](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/crstnbr/JuliaWorkshop18/blob/master/2%20Tips%20and%20tricks/optional_field_inheritance.ipynb))\r\n\r\n* **domain specific language (DSL)**: You can create special syntax that after the macros `code -&gt; code` transform is replaced by pure Julia constructs. This is used in many packages to define special syntax, for example [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/JuMP.jl/blob/release-0.18/examples/sudoku.jl#L44) and [here](https://turing.ml/dev/docs/using-turing/quick-start).\r\n\r\n* **code generation**: Imagine you want to write a really long piece of code which, although being long, is very simple because it has some kind of pattern that repeats itself rather trivially. Writing that code by hand can be a pain (or even practically impossible). A macro can programmatically generate the code for you. One example is for-loop unrolling (see [here](https://github.com/cstjean/Unrolled.jl) and [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/707616df0a22da1b834486f5ea5dff2b6dda15c6/base/math.jl#L91)). But even the `@time` macro isn&#39;t doing much more than just putting a bunch of `Base.time_ns()` function calls around the provided Julia expression.\r\n* **special string parsing**: If you type the literal `3.2` in Julia it will be parsed and interpreted as a `Float64`. Now, imagine you want to supply a number literally that goes beyond `Float64` precision but would fit into a `BigFloat`. Typing `big(3.123124812498124812498)` won&#39;t work, because the literal number is first interpreted as a `Float64` and then handed to the `big` function. Instead you need a way to tell Julia at parse time that this should become a `BigFloat`. This is handled by a `@big_str 3.2` macro which (for convenience) can also be written as `big&quot;3.2&quot;`. The latter is just syntactic sugar.\r\n\r\nThere might be many more applications of macros, but those are the most important to me.\r\n\r\n Let me end by referencing Steven G.

Remember, this is a recursive call.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137500/updating-parameter-value-in-java/58137559#58137559","title":"Updating Parameter Value in Java"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11699723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90592d70ad4b40721d4206d574d8a765?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aman Dhaliwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11699723/aman-dhaliwal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34,"user_id":11699723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/90592d70ad4b40721d4206d574d8a765?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aman Dhaliwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11699723/aman-dhaliwal"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58137559,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569603781,"creation_date":1569598220,"last_edit_date":1569603781,"question_id":58137500,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137500","body_markdown":"I wasn&#39;t too sure what to title this so I apologize in advance. I am currently trying to make a game where the total points must add up to 100 for a player to win. I am running into the issue where the &quot;PlayerTotalPoints&quot; is not updating after the PlayerTurn method returns the amount of PlayerTotalPoints and sets that as the new value in PlayerTotalPoints to be rerun in the method once again. \r\n\r\nThis is my code:\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            int PlayerTotalPoints = 0;\r\n            int ComputerTotalPoints = 0;\r\n            while (!IsGameOver(PlayerTotalPoints, ComputerTotalPoints)) {\r\n                int TurnPointCounter = 0;\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;It is the player&#39;s turn!&quot;);\r\n                PlayerTotalPoints = PlayerTurn(TurnPointCounter, PlayerTotalPoints);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;The player currently has &quot; + PlayerTotalPoints + &quot; total points!&quot;);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;It is the computer&#39;s turn!&quot;);\r\n                ComputerTotalPoints = ComputerTurn(TurnPointCounter, ComputerTotalPoints);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;The computer currently has &quot; + ComputerTotalPoints + &quot; total points!&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe method PlayerTurn returns the new value of the PlayerTotalPoints (I checked and it is returning the correct value of PlayerTotalPoints) but for some reason this value is not carrying over to the PlayerTotalPoints variable which needs to keep going as a player accumulates their score.

can tell me the oid to resolve it.  \r\nThx for your help.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137483/how-get-the-cisco-switch-interfaces-status-by-snmp","title":"how get the cisco

should use `ES6` syntax and JSX syntax instead of pure React API, that help you a lot to reduce this kind of error about scoping and become your code more readable, but If you even want to use that syntax, so you should bind the function once you pass down to the child component , you can do it like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var Parent = React.createClass({\r\n    \r\n        onSelect: function(value, flag){\r\n         this.updateSelected(value, flag);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        updateSelected: function(value, flag) {\r\n    \r\n            let array = this.state.selectedArray;\r\n    \r\n            array.push({&quot;value&quot;: value, &quot;flag&quot;: flag});\r\n            this.setState({\r\n                selectedArray: array\r\n

argument the context that you want your function execute, then once your function be invoked, the scope of that function will be the parent component instead of child component.\r\n\r\n&gt; Remember that this approach `bind` method could affect the improve of your component if your Parent component rerenders many times.\r\n\r\nIf you are using JSX syntax you should do something like\r\n\r\n    class YourComponent extends React.Component&#160;{\r\n      changeHandler = (value, flag) =&gt; {\r\n        this.updateSelected(value, flag);\r\n      }\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n

There are two concepts that are not quite right in this sentence.\r\n\r\nFirst, code cannot `await` a method. What actually happens is that the method is called, exactly like any other method. That method returns a value - an *awaitable* type - and it is that return value that is actually awaited. It&#39;s common for us to talk about &quot;awaiting a method&quot;, but that&#39;s just shorthand for &quot;calling a method and awaiting its return value&quot;, which is more accurate but too awkward for most conversation.\r\n\r\nSecond, `async` is just *one way* to create an awaitable return value (which can then be awaited). There are several other ways as well. For example, `Task&lt;T&gt;.Factory.FromAsync` is commonly used if you have an API that uses the [older APM asynchronous pattern](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm), and you want to use it with `await`. In that case, you would normally [write wrapper methods that return `Task&lt;T&gt;` and are implemented using `Task&lt;T&gt;.Factory.FromAsync` (without `async`)][1]. Another common approach is to use `TaskCompletionSource&lt;T&gt;`, which [can create a `Task&lt;T&gt;` around any kind of logical &quot;future event&quot;][2].\r\n\r\nTo put it another way, `async` is an implementation detail. This concept is further enforced by the fact that interface methods can be declared as returning `Task` and awaited, but only method *implementations* can be declared with `async`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/interop-with-other-asynchronous-patterns-and-types#from-apm-to-tap\r\n  [2]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/await-anything/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137388/why-isnt-webrequest-getresponseasync-async/58138523#58138523","title":"Why isn&#39;t WebRequest.GetResponseAsync() async?"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":11185273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fecf0225fae2437dfaf7267f78c28c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.

you don&#39;t need the `items` table for the queries.  Probably doesn&#39;t have much impact on performance, but no need.\r\n\r\nSo you can write the query as:\r\n\r\n    SELECT i_s.style_id, COUNT(*) as total\r\n    FROM items_themes i_t JOIN\r\n         items_styles i_s \r\n         ON i_s.item_id = i_t.item_id\r\n    WHERE i_t.theme_id IN (6, 7)\r\n    GROUP BY i_s.style_id;\r\n\r\nFor this query, you want an index on `items_themes(theme_id, item_id)`.  There is no much you can do about the `GROUP BY`.\r\n\r\nThen, I don&#39;t think this is what you really want, because it will double count an item that has both themes.  So, use `EXISTS` instead:\r\n\r\n    SELECT i_s.style_id, COUNT(*) as total\r\n    FROM items_styles i_s          \r\n    WHERE EXISTS (SELECT \r\n                  FROM items_themes i_t\r\n                  WHERE i_t.item_id = i_s.item_id AND\r\n                        i_t.theme_id IN (6, 7)\r\n                 )\r\n    GROUP BY i_s.style_id;\r\n\r\nFor this, you want an index on `items_themes(item_id, theme_id)`.  You can also try an index on `items_styles(style_id)`.  Some databases might be able to use that one, but I am guessing not MariaDB.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137385/how-to-optimize-sql-query-that-uses-group-by-and-joined-many-to-many-relation-ta/58137481#58137481","title":"How to optimize SQL query that uses GROUP BY and joined many-to-many relation tables?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":80904,"user_id":1766831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ee974306d2def46eb69534fbcf95cc5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rick James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1766831/rick-james"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570504373,"creation_date":1570504373,"answer_id":58279742,"question_id":58137385,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58279742","body_markdown":"In a many-to-many table, it is optimal to have these two indexes:\r\n\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (`item_id`, `style_id`),\r\n      INDEX `style` (`style_id`, `item_id`)\r\n\r\nAnd be sure to use `InnoDB`.\r\n\r\nMore discussion:  http://mysql.rjweb.org/doc.php/index_cookbook_mysql#many_to_many_mapping_table\r\n\r\nStill, you have two many-to-many mappings, so there probably is no great solution.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137385/how-to-optimize-sql-query-that-uses-group-by-and-joined-many-to-many-relation-ta/58279742#58279742","title":"How to optimize SQL query that uses GROUP BY and joined many-to-many relation tables?"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":8117835,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db538896cc7aa6a41e20546eeea399e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aleksandr Usarov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8117835/aleksandr-usarov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":61,"user_id":8117835,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db538896cc7aa6a41e20546eeea399e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aleksandr Usarov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8117835/aleksandr-usarov"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570504373,"creation_date":1569597750,"last_edit_date":1569598645,"question_id":58137385,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137385","body_markdown":"I have tables with many-to-many relations:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE `item` (\r\n      `id` mediumint(8) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,\r\n      `name` varchar(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;&#39;,\r\n      `size_id` tinyint(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (`id`),\r\n      INDEX `size` (`size_id`)\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE `items_styles` (\r\n      `style_id` smallint(5) unsigned NOT NULL,\r\n      `item_id` mediumint(8) unsigned NOT NULL,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (`item_id`, `style_id`),\r\n      INDEX `style` (`style_id`),\r\n      INDEX `item` (`item_id`),\r\n      CONSTRAINT `items_styles_item_id_item_id` FOREIGN KEY (`item_id`) REFERENCES `item` (`id`)\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    CREATE TABLE `items_themes` (\r\n      `theme_id` tinyint(3) unsigned NOT NULL,\r\n      `item_id` mediumint(8) unsigned NOT NULL,\r\n      PRIMARY KEY (`item_id`, `theme_id`),\r\n      INDEX `theme` (`theme_id`),\r\n      INDEX `item` (`item_id`),\r\n      CONSTRAINT `items_themes_item_id_item_id` FOREIGN KEY (`item_id`) REFERENCES `item` (`id`)\r\n    );\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to get the report that shows `style_id` and the number of items that use this style but with applying filters to the `item` table and/or to another table, like this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT i_s.style_id, COUNT(i.id) total FROM item i\r\n    JOIN items_themes i_t ON i.id = i_t.item_id AND i_t.theme_id IN (6, 7)\r\n    JOIN items_styles i_s ON i.id = i_s.item_id\r\n    GROUP BY i_s.style_id;\r\n    \r\n    -- or like this\r\n    SELECT i_s.style_id, COUNT(i.id) total FROM item i\r\n    JOIN items_themes i_t ON i.id = i_t.item_id AND i_t.theme_id IN (6, 7)\r\n    JOIN items_styles i_s ON i.id = i_s.item_id\r\n    WHERE i.size_id != 3\r\n    GROUP BY i_s.style_id;\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/bLPG2.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Aut4p.png\r\n\r\nThe problem is that tables are pretty big so queries take a long time to execute (~8 seconds)\r\n\r\n`item` - 8M rows\r\n`items_styles` - 12M rows\r\n`items_themes` - 11M rows\r\n\r\nIs there any way to optimize these queries?

My assumption is that when you see it fire the second time, 30 seconds has elapsed and event grid is retrying the message.  The workaround for longer running functions is to have a queue in the middle.

am currently creating a react-native app and testing it using exp on a physical Pixel 2. When I load my app up, I have the following in componentDidMount:\r\n\r\n    componentDidMount = () =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        firebase.auth().onAuthStateChanged((user)=&gt;{ \r\n            if (user) {\r\n                //this.setState({userid: user.uid}); //I added this to see if it was the below slowing things down (it is not)\r\n                firebase.database().ref(&#39;/Users/&#39;+user.uid+&#39;/Public/&#39;).once(&#39;value&#39;)\r\n                .catch(err=&gt;{console.log(err)})\r\n                .then(snapshot=&gt;{\r\n\r\n                    let username = snapshot.child(&#39;Username&#39;).val();\r\n                        this.setState({username: username, userid: user.uid});\r\n                    });\r\n                \r\n            } else {\r\n    \r\n                this.setState({ user: null, username: null});\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n        });}\r\n\r\nMy aim is to direct the user to the log-in page if they are not authenticated. Otherwise, dive straight into the inner pages. My code sort-of-works and this does actually take place (hurray!). \r\n\r\nHowever, when I load my app up is takes a number of seconds (maybe 10 seconds), for the app to realise that I am already signed in. This means it shows the log-in page for 10 seconds and then starts to display the inner pages. Has anyone got any idea of why it takes so long for `.onAuthStateChanged` to register that I am in fact still signed in from my last session? And is there any way for me to know whether I am at the login page because I am not logged in at all or because the app doesn&#39;t yet realise that I am logged in? It is very awkward for the user having to sign in every time and then mid way through typing their details in, being logged in lol!\r\n\r\nAs always, all help is much appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137339/firebase-authentication-general-query","title":"Firebase Authentication.

don&#39;t understand a problem encountered during the development of mixin used as a decorator, if a static attribute is included in the code of the mixin my class name is modified in the process.

};\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn another file, I want to use my Mixin as follows:\r\n```\r\n@Composite\r\nclass MyCompositeA {\r\n // All my class stuff\r\n};\r\n\r\nMyCompositeA.declareGlobal(); // &lt;- error TS2339: Property &#39;declareGlobal&#39; does not exist on type &#39;typeof MyComposite&#39;.\r\n\r\n\r\nconst testElem = new MyCompositeA();\r\nconsole.log(testElem.constructor.name); // &lt;- return &#39;_a&#39; if the boolean is initialized and MyCompositeA in the other case \r\n```\r\n[Playground][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I see in the generated Javascript, when the initialization value is added, a temporary class is created in the code and is returned as the new Type. \r\n\r\nI have two questions :\r\n\r\n- Is there a solution to keep the original class name, I want to use dependency injection. If I create a second class with the decorator its name is the same (the &#39;_a&#39; generated).\r\n- Is it possible to avoid the error of declareGlobal unknown ?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** \r\n\r\nIn response to a comment of Aluan Haddad, I&#39;ve updated the Playground ([PlayGround][2]) if I create two classes using this function with the boolean initialized, the constructor.name field is the same for any instance created with the two different classes. \r\n\r\nI obtain the following inheritance tree with Node (little difference with the playground) with the boolean initialization :\r\n````\r\n_a &lt;- MyCompositeA &lt;- Object\r\n_a &lt;- MyCompositeB &lt;- Object\r\n````\r\nAnd without :\r\n````\r\nMyCompositeA &lt;- Object\r\nMyCompositeB &lt;- Object\r\n````\r\nI don&#39;t know if it is a normal situation or not.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE2:** \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve completely reworked my implementation, I&#39;ve redesigned my class function and I can keep the name of my class as wished initially:\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface IElement {\r\n  register(param: any): void;\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass CElement implements IElement {\r\n  public static asGlobal: boolean = false;\r\n  public static declareGlobal() {\r\n    this.asGlobal = true;\r\n    return this;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  constructor(public pEl: string) {}\r\n\r\n  register(param: any) {\r\n    console.log(&#39;register&#39;, param, this.pEl);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Constructor&lt;T = {}&gt; = new (...args: any[]) =&gt; T;\r\n\r\nfunction Composite&lt;T extends Constructor&gt;(Target: T) {\r\n  let container = {\r\n    [Target.name]: class extends CElement {  // Little hack here to force the name of the class\r\n      constructor () {\r\n\t      super(&#39;Try&#39;);\r\n\t      Target.constructor.apply(this, []);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  let result = container[Target.name];\r\n  Object.getOwnPropertyNames(Target.prototype).forEach(name =&gt; {\r\n    Object.defineProperty(result.prototype, name, {value: Target.prototype[name]});\r\n  });\r\n  return container[Target.name];\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst MyCompositeA = Composite(\r\nclass MyCompositeA {\r\n\r\n  f() {\r\n    console.log(&quot;Inheritance f: OK&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nconst MyCompositeB = Composite(\r\nclass MyCompositeB {\r\n  g() {\r\n    console.log(&quot;Inheritance g: OK&quot;);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nThe only remaining error is that I wanted to add &quot;implements target&quot; in my class definition but it seems that it is impossible (Error: &#39;Target&#39; refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.) [Playground][3]\r\n\r\nError that I don&#39;t understand because we can extend Target but not implement it ???\r\nSorry for the multiple questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The namespace prefix is a document-local name for a namespace URI. `wp:title` requires a parser to look for a `xmlns:wp=&quot;...&quot;` attribute to find the namespace itself (usually a URL but any globally unique string would do), either on the tag itself or on a parent tag. This connects tags to a unique value without making tag names too verbose to type out or read.\r\n\r\nYou need to provide the namepace, and optionally, the namespace mapping (mapping short names to full namespace names) to the element maker object. The default `E` object provided doesn&#39;t have a namespace or namespace map set. I&#39;m going to assume that here that `wp` is the `http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/` Wordpress namespace, as that seems the most likely, although it could also be that you are trying to send [Windows Phone notifications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/apps/jj662933(v=vs.105)).\r\n\r\nInstead of using the default `E` element maker, create your own `ElementMaker` instance and pass it a `namespace` argument to tell `lxml` what URL the element belongs to. To get the right prefix on your element names, you also need to give it a `nsmap` dictionary that maps prefixes to URLs:\r\n\r\n    from lxml.builder import ElementMaker\r\n\r\n    namespaces = {&quot;wp&quot;: &quot;http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/&quot;}\r\n    E = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;wp&quot;], nsmap=namespaces)\r\n\r\n    title = E.title(&quot;Value of the wp:title tag&quot;)\r\n\r\nThis produces a tag with both the correct prefix, *and* the `xmlns:wp` attribute:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from lxml.builder import ElementMaker\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; namespaces = {&quot;wp&quot;: &quot;http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/&quot;}\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; E = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;wp&quot;], nsmap=namespaces)\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; title = E.title(&quot;Value of the wp:title tag&quot;)\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; etree.tostring(title, encoding=&quot;unicode&quot;)\r\n&#39;&lt;wp:title xmlns:wp=&quot;http://wordpress.org/export/1.2/&quot;&gt;Value of the wp:title tag&lt;/wp:title&gt;&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can omit the `nsmap` value, but then you&#39;d want to have such a map on a *parent* element of the document. In that case, you probably want to make separate `ElementMaker` objects for each namespace you need to support, and you put the `nsmap` namespace mapping on the outer-most element. When writing out the document, `lxml` then uses the short names throughout.\r\n\r\nFor example, creating a [Wordpress WXR format document](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9356099/wordpress-wxr-specification) would require a number of namespaces:\r\n\r\n    from lxml.builder import ElementMaker\r\n\r\n    namespaces = {\r\n        &quot;excerpt&quot;: &quot;https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/excerpt/&quot;,\r\n        &quot;content&quot;: &quot;http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/&quot;,\r\n        &quot;wfw&quot;: &quot;http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/&quot;,\r\n        &quot;dc&quot;: &quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;,\r\n        &quot;wp&quot;: &quot;https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/&quot;,\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    RootElement = ElementMaker(nsmap=namespaces)\r\n    ExcerptElement = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;excerpt&quot;])\r\n    ContentElement = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;content&quot;])\r\n    CommentElement = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;wfw&quot;])\r\n    DublinCoreElement = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;dc&quot;])\r\n    ExportElement = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;wp&quot;])\r\n\r\nand then you&#39;d construct a document with\r\n\r\n    doc = RootElement.rss(\r\n        RootElement.channel(\r\n            ExportElement.wxr_version(&quot;1.2&quot;),\r\n            # etc. ...\r\n        ),\r\n        version=&quot;2.0&quot;\r\n    )\r\n\r\nwhich, when pretty printed with `etree.tostring(doc, pretty_print=True, encoding=&quot;unicode&quot;)`, produces:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;rss xmlns:excerpt=&quot;https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/excerpt/&quot; xmlns:content=&quot;http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/&quot; xmlns:wfw=&quot;http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/&quot; xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot; xmlns:wp=&quot;https://wordpress.org/export/1.2/&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;channel&gt;\r\n    &lt;wp:wxr_version&gt;1.2&lt;/wp:wxr_version&gt;\r\n  &lt;/channel&gt;\r\n&lt;/rss&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how only the root `&lt;rss&gt;` element has `xmlns` attributes, and how the `&lt;wp:wxr_version&gt;` tag uses the right prefix even though we only gave it the namespace URI.\r\n\r\nTo give a different example, if you are building a Windows Phone tile notification, it&#39;d be simpler. After all, there is just a single namespace to use:\r\n\r\n    from lxml.builder import ElementMaker\r\n\r\n    namespaces = {&quot;wp&quot;: &quot;WPNotification&quot;}\r\n    E = ElementMaker(namespace=namespaces[&quot;wp&quot;], nsmap=namespaces)\r\n\r\n    notification = E.Notification(\r\n        E.Tile(\r\n            E.BackgroundImage(&quot;https://example.com/someimage.png&quot;),\r\n            E.Count(&quot;42&quot;),\r\n            E.Title(&quot;The notification title&quot;),\r\n            # ...\r\n        )\r\n    )\r\n\r\nwhich produces\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;wp:Notification xmlns:wp=&quot;WPNotification&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;wp:Tile&gt;\r\n    &lt;wp:BackgroundImage&gt;https://example.com/someimage.png&lt;/wp:BackgroundImage&gt;\r\n    &lt;wp:Count&gt;42&lt;/wp:Count&gt;\r\n    &lt;wp:Title&gt;The notification title&lt;/wp:Title&gt;\r\n  &lt;/wp:Tile&gt;\r\n&lt;/wp:Notification&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly the outer-most element, `&lt;wp:Notification&gt;`, now has the `xmlns:wp` attribute. All other elements only need to include the `wp:` prefix.\r\n\r\nNote that the prefix used is *entirely up to you* and even *optional*. It is the namespace URI that is the real key to uniquely identifying elements across different XML documents. If you used `E = ElementMaker(namespace=&quot;WPNotification&quot;, nsmap={None: &quot;WPNotification&quot;})` instead, and so produced a top-level element with `&lt;Notification xmlns=&quot;WPNotification&quot;&gt;` you still have a perfectly legal XML document that, according to the XML standard, has the exact same meaning.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137296/python-lxml-how-i-use-tag-in-items-name/58138067#58138067","title":"python lxml how i use tag in items name?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12087451,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2d60fe3b665a8d8f32441af363cdd8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Lucian Blaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087451/lucian-blaga"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58138067,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569610549,"creation_date":1569597414,"question_id":58137296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137296","body_markdown":"i need to build xml file using special name of items, this is my current code :\r\n```python\r\nfrom lxml import etree\r\nimport lxml\r\nfrom lxml.builder import E\r\n\r\nwp = E.wp\r\n\r\ntmp = wp(&quot;title&quot;)\r\n\r\nprint(etree.tostring(tmp))\r\n```\r\n\r\ncurrent output is this :\r\n```\r\nb&#39;&lt;wp&gt;title&lt;/wp&gt;&#39;\r\n```\r\ni want to be :\r\n```\r\nb&#39;&lt;wp:title&gt;title&lt;/title:wp&gt;&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nhow i can create items with name like this : `wp:title` ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137296/python-lxml-how-i-use-tag-in-items-name","title":"python lxml how i use tag in items name?"},{"tags":["python","numpy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":172809,"user_id":3293881,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6ZYnq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Divakar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3293881/divakar"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569597475,"post_id":58137295,"comment_id":102661196,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137295/couldnt-transpose-numpy-3d-array#comment102661196_58137295"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":11486181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCMLh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavel Antspovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486181/pavel-antspovich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569598402,"post_id":58137532,"comment_id":102661615,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137295/couldnt-transpose-numpy-3d-array/58137532#comment102661615_58137532"},{"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":11409321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c78fd448cf9333d158083c41bec6d60c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sultan Singh Atwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11409321/sultan-singh-atwal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":118,"user_id":11486181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCMLh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavel Antspovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486181/pavel-antspovich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569598890,"post_id":58137532,"comment_id":102661868,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137295/couldnt-transpose-numpy-3d-array/58137532#comment102661868_58137532"},{"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":11486181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RCMLh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pavel Antspovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11486181/pavel-antspovich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569599166,"post_id":58137532,"comment_id":102661992,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137295/couldnt-transpose-numpy-3d-array/58137532#comment102661992_58137532"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":11409321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c78fd448cf9333d158083c41bec6d60c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sultan Singh Atwal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11409321/sultan-singh-atwal"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569598333,"creation_date":1569598333,"answer_id":58137532,"question_id":58137295,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58137532","body_markdown":"Try typing &#39;arr = arr.transpose(1, 0, 2)&#39; in place of &#39;arr.transpose(1, 0, 2)&#39;.

Resource-like class declarations such as you demonstrate (and which you really ought to avoid as much as possible) do not imply any particular ordering of the declared class.  Neither do declarations via the `include` function.\r\n\r\nClass declarations via the `require` function place a single-ended ordering constraint on the declared class relative to the declaring class or defined type, and declarations via the `contain` function place a double-ended ordering constraint similar to that applying to all resource declarations.  The chaining arrows and ordering metaparameters can place additional ordering constraints on classes.\r\n\r\n&gt; But i really dont know how to handle this. I think there must be a way or?\r\n\r\nYour last example shows a viable way to enforce ordering at the level of `profile::puppetserver`, but its effectiveness is contingent on each of its `contain`ed classes taking the same approach for any classes they themselves declare, at least where those third-level classes must be constrained by the order of the second-level classes.  This appears to be where you are falling down.\r\n\r\nNote also that although there is definitely a need to order some things relative to some others, it is not necessary or much useful to try to enforce an explicit total order over all resources.  Work with the lightest hand possible, placing only those ordering constraints that serve a good purpose.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137288/puppet-class-ordering-containment-always-wrong-order/58143868#58143868","title":"Puppet: Class Ordering / Containment - always wrong order"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11745482"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2204,"user_id":4949684,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7d220.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Carlos Cavero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4949684/carlos-cavero"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58143868,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569709055,"creation_date":1569597385,"last_edit_date":1569709055,"question_id":58137288,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58137288","body_markdown":"I read a lot about ordering puppet classes with containment (iam using Puppet 6). But it still does not work for me in one case. Maybe my english is not good enough and i miss something. Maybe somebody know what iam doing wrong.\r\n\r\nI have a profile to installing a puppetserver (`profile::puppetserver`). This profile has three sub-classes which I *contain* within the `profile::puppetserver`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass profile::puppetserver(\r\n) {\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::install\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::config\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::firewall\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat works fine for me. Now I want to expand this profile and install `PuppetDB`. For this, i use the `puppetdb` module from [puppet forge](https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb):\r\n\r\nSo what i do is add `profile::puppetserver::puppetdb` and the contain to the `profile::puppetserver`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass profile::puppetserver::puppetdb(\r\n) {\r\n\r\n  # Configure puppetdb and its underlying database\r\n  class { &#39;puppetdb&#39;: }\r\n\r\n  # Configure the Puppet master to use puppetdb\r\n  class { &#39;puppetdb::master::config&#39;: }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. When i provision my `puppetserver` first and add the `profile::puppetserver::puppetdb` after it, `puppetdb` installs and everything works fine.\r\n\r\n2. If I add it directly with `contain`, and provisioning everything at once, it crashes. It&#39;s because the `puppetdb` module is installed randomly during my *master server* installs (and also the `postgresql` server and so on). That ends in my `puppetserver` is not running and my `puppetdb` generate no local `ssl` certificates and the service doesn&#39;t comes up.\r\n\r\nWhat i try first:\r\n\r\nI installed the `puppetdb` Package in my `profile::puppetserver::puppetdb` directly and use the required flag. It works when i provision all at once.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass profile::puppetserver::puppetdb (\r\n) {\r\n\r\n  Package { &#39;puppetdb&#39;:\r\n    ensure =&gt; installed,\r\n    require =&gt; Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::config&#39;]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo i think i could do the same in the code above:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass profile::puppetserver::puppetdb(\r\n) {\r\n\r\n  # Configure puppetdb and its underlying database\r\n  class { &#39;puppetdb&#39;: \r\n    require =&gt; Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::config&#39;]\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  # Configure the Puppet master to use puppetdb\r\n  class { &#39;puppetdb::master::config&#39;: \r\n    require =&gt; Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::config&#39;]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this does not work... \r\n\r\nSo i read about puppet class containment and ordering by chains. So i did this in my `profile::puppetserver`\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass profile::puppetserver(\r\n) {\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::install\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::config\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::firewall\r\n  contain profile::puppetserver::puppetdb\r\n\r\n  Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::install&#39;] -&gt;\r\n  Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::config&#39;] -&gt;\r\n  Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::firewall&#39;] -&gt;\r\n  Class[&#39;profile::puppetserver::puppetdb&#39;]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it still does not have any effect... he still starts to install `postgresql` and the `puppetdb` package during my &quot;puppetserver provisioning&quot; in the install, config, firewall steps.\r\n\r\nHow i must write the ordering, that all things from the `puppetdb` module, which i call in `profile::puppetserver::puppetdb`, only starts when the rest of the provisioning steps are finished?\r\n\r\nI really don&#39;t understand it. I think maybe it haves something to do with the fact, that i declare classes from the `puppetdb` module inside of `profile::puppetserver::puppetdb` and not the directly `Resource Type`. Because when i use the `Package Resource Type` with the Require Flag, it seems to work. But i really don&#39;t know how to handle this. I think there must be a way or?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137288/puppet-class-ordering-containment-always-wrong-order","title":"Puppet: Class Ordering / Containment - always wrong order"},{"tags":["javascript","fullcalendar"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597694,"post_id":58137287,"comment_id":102661302,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137287/fullcalendar-cant-disable-resizing-and-enable-draggable#comment102661302_58137287"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5865995,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0VZXl-TbEtk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABDM/EupB0xL-Ez4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Kononenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5865995/eugene-kononenko"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597752,"post_id":58137287,"comment_id":102661332,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137287/fullcalendar-cant-disable-resizing-and-enable-draggable#comment102661332_58137287"},{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569598024,"post_id":58137287,"comment_id":102661446,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137287/fullcalendar-cant-disable-resizing-and-enable-draggable#comment102661446_58137287"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5865995,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0VZXl-TbEtk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABDM/EupB0xL-Ez4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Kononenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5865995/eugene-kononenko"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569599821,"post_id":58137287,"comment_id":102662290,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58137287/fullcalendar-cant-disable-resizing-and-enable-draggable#comment102662290_58137287"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569601563,"creation_date":1569601563,"answer_id":58138313,"question_id":58137287,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58138313","body_markdown":"You seem to be setting global options in an event context.

Rather than grouping ALL my data into annual means prior to analysis, I would like to simply specify that a single datapoint (the one that&#39;s an annual mean) has a random effect value of 0. One can easily do this when predicting a response value based on the mean of the random effect by either setting `re.form=NA` or `allow.new.levels=T` (with the new level just an `NA`) in the `predict.mermod` call.
