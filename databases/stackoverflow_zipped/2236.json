you have a large array, you can do this without sorting the list, \r\nwhich is a little faster like \r\n```python\r\nfrom operator import add\r\nfrom functools import reduce\r\n\r\nA = [[1, 2, 4],\r\n     [3, 5, 6],\r\n     [7,8,9]]\r\n\r\naddlists = lambda l: reduce(add, l)\r\nlist_A = addlists(A)\r\nresult = [list_A.pop(list_A.index(min(list_A))) for _ in range(3)]\r\n```\r\nIt&#39;s a little more complicated, though the modules imported are really useful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008663/how-to-get-the-get-the-lowest-sum-of-3-elements-in-matrix/58009076#58009076","title":"How to get the get the lowest sum of 3 elements in

correct that git has three storage areas - the work tree, the staging area (sometimes called the index), and what you refer to as the local repository[1] (the collection of objects, including `COMMIT`s, that make up the project history - normally called the database).\r\n\r\nBut of those, the only one you can compile, run, or load into a text editor is the working directory.  So rather than &quot;switch to the local repository&quot; as you put it, what you would need to do to run the committed version is update the worktree (or, at least *a* worktree - there can be more than one) to match the committed version.\r\n\r\nHow exactly to do that depends on circumstances, and the situation you outlined is actually a little odd (and likely to cause you other, unrelated problems), which makes it hard to give a detailed answer.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the idea that &quot;I&#39;ve changed 3 files but only 2 of them need to be committed&quot;...  That&#39;s usually a sign of a problem waiting to happen.  If the third file is not in the repo at all and is listed in `.gitignore`, it can be ok; but all else being equal, you are better off when your worktree is as close as possible to being just a reflection of the content you&#39;re committing.\r\n\r\nIf that third file isn&#39;t committed / is ignored, then you can use `git status` to confirm whether you&#39;ve committed everything else.  It will tell you which files have staged changes, which have unstaged changes, which have never been committed, etc.  You can use `git diff` to get more detail about what changes have not been staged (or `git diff --staged` to see those that *have* been staged but not committed).\r\n\r\nBut to really know that what you&#39;ve committed works, you need to &quot;check out&quot; the committed version.  \r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t have uncommitted changes you need to preserve, this is easy - `git status` will tell you how to revert to the committed state.  (Generally `git reset -- :/:` and then `git checkout -- :/:` would work.)\r\n\r\nIf you do have uncommitted changes you need to preserve, you could stash them (but there are edge cases where that may not do exactly what you intend - e.g. if you have both staged and unstaged changes, you may end up in a situation where you get them all back unstaged).  See https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash\r\n\r\nOr you can use a separate clone of the repo for testing.  This is typical for build servers, but can also be done locally.  A slightly lighter-weight solution is to create a second worktree attached to your existing repo.  Docs supporting those options:\r\n\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-stage\r\nhttps://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n[1] The &quot;repository&quot; usually is a term for the whole thing - all three storage areas.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008627/git-switch-to-local-repository-from-working-directory/58012854#58012854","title":"Git: Switch to local repository from working directory"}],"owner":{"reputation":48,"user_id":8517375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d42497544d4e90fbed88996f19bad575?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abhinandan Khilari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8517375/abhinandan-khilari"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58012854,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568901926,"creation_date":1568887734,"question_id":58008627,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008627","body_markdown":"As far I have understood, there are three stages in git workflow - \r\n\r\n1.

Local repository where files are commited from the Staging area.\r\n\r\nSuppose I have commited several files from the working directory. Those commited files will be in the local repository. Now, I need verify if all the required files are commited by running the project. How can I switch to local repository for running the code to verify commited changes before pushing them to remote?\r\n\r\nFor example, consider there are 3 files in the working directory - one.js, two.js, three.js and all the files are modified, but only two of them - one.js and two.js needs to be commited which contains inter-dependent changes. But suppose I only commit one.js and forgot to commit two.js and because of this the app will be broken in the local repository. For this case, I need to run and verfiy the app from local repository which contains only commited changes and not all the changes unlike working directory.

the following will get you what you want:\r\n\r\n    SELECT `month`, \r\n           COUNT(CASE response_val WHEN 4 THEN 1 END) AS `yes`,\r\n           COUNT(CASE response_val WHEN 5 THEN 1 END) AS `no`\r\n    FROM audit\r\n    WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98\r\n    GROUP BY `month`\r\n\r\nI simplified your case statements and move the `response_key` condition into the `where`-clause (the `ELSE` part in a `CASE` statement is only necessary if you want to return a value other than `null`).\r\n\r\nYou can find a working demo here: https://rextester.com/PCN24609\r\n\r\nThe resulting counts  from this query are:\r\n\r\n    month\t   yes\t   no\r\n    2019-09\t   1       11\r\n\r\nWell, you can swap the order of your output columns as you like, and if you are only interested in the `response_val=4` counts do it like here:\r\n\r\n    SELECT COUNT(CASE response_val WHEN 4 THEN 1 END) AS `count`,\r\n           `month`\r\n    FROM audit\r\n    WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98\r\n    GROUP BY `month`\r\n\r\ndemo: https://rextester.com/JEV40175\r\n\r\nresult:\r\n\r\n    | count | month   |\r\n    -------------------\r\n    |     1 | 2019-09 |\r\n\r\n**Edit**:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Return a count when response_val=4 is found between response_key 95\r\n&gt; to 98 corresponding to each uhid and group by month&quot;\r\n\r\nThis would imply that you simply group over `uhid` too, like shown here:\r\n\r\n    SELECT COUNT(CASE response_val WHEN 4 THEN 1 END) AS `count`,\r\n               `month`,uhid\r\n    FROM audit\r\n    WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98\r\n    GROUP BY `month`,uhid;\r\n    \r\n    -- results:\r\n    count\tmonth\tuhid\r\n\t0\t    2019-09\t13256\r\n\t2\t    2019-09\t14569\r\n\t1\t    2019-09\t25689\r\n\r\nOr, if you want all `uhid`-counts in one row per month:\r\n\r\n    SELECT `month`,\r\n           COUNT(CASE uhid WHEN 14569 THEN 1 END) AS `cnt_14569`,\r\n           COUNT(CASE uhid WHEN 13256 THEN 1 END) AS `cnt_13256`,\r\n           COUNT(CASE uhid WHEN 25689 THEN 1 END) AS `cnt_25689`\r\n    FROM audit\r\n    WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98 AND response_val=4\r\n    GROUP BY `month`,uhid\r\n\r\n    -- results:\r\n  \tmonth\tcnt_14569\tcnt_13256\tcnt_25689\r\n\t2019-09\t        2\t        0\t        0\r\n\t2019-09\t        0\t        0\t        1    \r\n\r\ndemo: https://rextester.com/WXQ73318\r\n\r\n**2. Edit:** Following your latest comment, the following might fulfil your requirements  \r\n(&quot;list the number of distinct users with `response_val=4` for each month&quot;):\r\n\r\n    SELECT COUNT(`count`) usrcnt, `month` FROM (\r\n     SELECT COUNT(CASE response_val WHEN 4 THEN 1 END) AS `count`,`month`,uhid\r\n     FROM audit WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98\r\n     GROUP BY `month`,uhid\r\n    ) tbl WHERE `count`&gt;0 GROUP BY `month`;\r\n\r\n    -- or, even shorter:\r\n\r\n    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CASE response_val WHEN 4 THEN uhid END) AS `count`,`month`\r\n    FROM audit WHERE response_key between 95 AND 98\r\n    GROUP BY `month`;\r\n\r\n    -- same result from both queries:\r\n    usrcnt\tmonth\r\n   \t     2  2019-09\r\n\r\ndemo: https://rextester.com/UGN73913\r\n\r\nThe latest queries are based on these table values:\r\n\r\n    response_key   response_val    month    uhid\r\n              95              4  2019-09   14569\r\n              96              4  2019-09   14569\r\n              97              5  2019-09   14569\r\n              98              5  2019-09   14569\r\n              95              5  2019-09   13256\r\n              96              5  2019-09   13256\r\n              97              5  2019-09   13256\r\n              98              5  2019-09   13256\r\n              95              5  2019-09   25689\r\n              96              4  2019-09   25689\r\n              97              5  2019-09   25689\r\n              98              5  2019-09   25689","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008607/count-whether-a-value-exist-from-a-range-of-keys/58009323#58009323","title":"Count whether a value exist from a range of keys"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10827934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZMNlaaxVkU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHk/5WapTf7PGR8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rina Xavier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10827934/rina-xavier"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10827934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZMNlaaxVkU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHk/5WapTf7PGR8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rina Xavier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10827934/rina-xavier"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568984231,"creation_date":1568887653,"last_edit_date":1568891204,"question_id":58008607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008607","body_markdown":"Return a count when response_val=4 is found between response_key 95 to 98 corresponding to each uhid and group by month\r\n\r\n    |response_key  | response_val | month  | uhid |\r\n    |---------------------------------------------|\r\n    |  95          |  4           | 2019-09| 14569|\r\n    |  96          |  4           | 2019-09| 14569|\r\n    |  97          |  5           | 2019-09| 14569|\r\n    |  98          |  5           | 2019-09| 14569|\r\n    |  95          |  5           | 2019-09| 13256|\r\n    |  96          |  5           | 2019-09| 13256|\r\n    |  97          |  5           | 2019-09| 13256|\r\n    |  98          |  5           | 2019-09| 13256|\r\n    |  95          |  5           | 2019-09| 25689|\r\n    |  96          |  5           | 2019-09| 25689|\r\n    |  97          |  5           | 2019-09| 25689|\r\n    |  98          |  5           | 2019-09| 25689|\r\n    |---------------------------------------------|\r\n\r\nI tried sql query as \r\n\r\n    SELECT month,\r\n           COUNT(CASE\r\n              WHEN `response_key` IN (95,96,97,98) and `response_val`=&#39;5&#39;\r\n              THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS &#39;yes&#39;,\r\n           COUNT(CASE\r\n              WHEN `response_key` IN (81,82,83,84,85,86,87) and `response_val`=&#39;4&#39;\r\n              THEN 1 ELSE NULL END) AS &#39;no&#39;

Now main problem was that due to linux OS on my Jenkins server, there were permission problem for few of my node_modules folders , so build was getting failure every time.\r\nSo In my script section for Jenkins , I changed all directories permission for Jenkins workspace like \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n&gt; chmod 777 &quot;Jenkins_nodeModules_path&quot;\r\n\r\n3. then I added \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;sudo npm install&quot;\r\n\r\n to same script.\r\n\r\nSo these changes were made on Jenkins project configuration to build project successfully.Hope it helps someone :-)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008556/angular-java-jenkins-build-fail-on-angular-upgrade-from-6-to-8/58037472#58037472","title":"Angular Java Jenkins build fail on angular upgrade from 6 to 8"}],"owner":{"reputation":639,"user_id":4269425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bb6058fca8a87b9b0dcf3668f7e626f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shilpi Jaiswal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4269425/shilpi-jaiswal"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569042929,"creation_date":1568887514,"question_id":58008556,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008556","body_markdown":"I am using angular 8 and node version 10 with back end as JAVA 8.

But the time consumption for the CGAL functions is up to 2.6 times as high. \r\n\r\nXeon E5645 @ 2.4 GHz, Win10 direct (no VM)\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    Time consumption:\r\n    * START [Double precision test]...\r\n    * STOP [Double precision test]:10.1158 s\r\n    \r\n    * START [CGAL simple]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL simple]:15.8708 s\r\n    \r\n    * START [CGAL GMPQ]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL GMPQ]:20.1676 s\r\n    \r\n    Factors:\r\n      CgalSimple / Double = 1.5689\r\n      CgalGmpq / Double = 1.99366\r\n\r\n...on an old Xeon server the result is similar, the CGAL functions are up to 2 times slower than the double precision test. \r\n\r\nCompile conditions: \r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nI have used CGAL-4.13.1. CGAL and the benchmark program have been compiled under Win10 with VS2015.  I have already tried various optimization options. The last test has been carried out with the command:\r\n\r\n(Edit: Optimization setting changed to O2)\r\n\r\n/MP /GS- /TP /GL /W3 /Zc:wchar_t /I&quot;c:\\benchCgal&quot; /I&quot;c:\\benchCgal\\3rdParty_64\\boost_1_68_0&quot;

Different CPU types (or in one case VM use) affect the whole program and thus the factors are still meaninful.\r\n\r\n\r\n(edit):\r\nNew Benchmark Data\r\n==================\r\n\r\nIn the discussions below the benchmark method has been discussed because Windows ran in a VM. Now a colleque ran it for me on his dual-boot machine, i7-7700 CPU @ 3.6 GHz.\r\n\r\nWINDOWS:\r\n\r\n    * START [Double precision test]...\r\n    * STOP [Double precision test]:3.13713 s \r\n    &#160;\r\n    * START [CGAL simple]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL simple]:7.66628 s (+86 % compared to linux)\r\n    &#160;\r\n    * START [CGAL GMPQ]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL GMPQ]:10.6407 s (+78% compared to linux)\r\n\r\nLinux:\r\n\r\n    * START [Double precision test]...\r\n    * STOP [Double precision test]:4.41382 s\r\n    &#160;\r\n    * START [CGAL simple]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL simple]:4.10052 s\r\n    &#160;\r\n    * START [CGAL GMPQ]...\r\n    * STOP [CGAL GMPQ]:5.97985 s\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew benchmark numbers with MinGW (added Oct.10th 2019)\r\n================================\r\n\r\ni7-7820HQ @ 2.90 GHz, Win10 Pro, Ubuntu 18.04 as subsystem\r\n\r\n    CGAL GMPQ:\r\n      Ubuntu: 4.8 s\r\n      Win10 VS2015: 12.5 s\r\n      Win10 MinGW:  12.5 s\r\n    \r\n    CGAL simple:\r\n      Ubuntu: 2.6 s\r\n      Win10 VS2015: 9.1 s\r\n      Win10 MinGW:  7 s \r\n\r\nThe first test is dominated by computations that require GMPQ numbers. These are equally bad with VS2015 and MinGW (2.6 times worse than under Linux). In contrast the simple test does not involve GMPQ numbers and it is 23 % faster with MinGW (although still 2.6 times worse than under Linux). \r\n\r\nJust a thought: The operations carry out many new/delete operations. Can the memory management under Windows be so much worse? Wouldn&#39;t a memory pool - at least for internal intermediate calculations - drastically improve the performance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008543/why-is-cgal-significantly-slower-under-windows","title":"Why is CGAL significantly slower under

[sort package](https://golang.org/pkg/sort/) demonstrates how interfaces can be used to implement algorithms in a type-independent way.\r\n\r\nLinear search requires two essential operations that depend on the haystack element type, Len and Equal. So we can write the following Haystack interface and a Search function that using it:\r\n\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Haystack interface {\r\n\tLen() int\r\n\tEqual(int, interface{}) bool\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc Search(haystack Haystack, needle interface{}) int {\r\n\tfor i := 0; i &lt; haystack.Len(); i++ {\r\n\t\tif haystack.Equal(i, needle) {\r\n\t\t\treturn i\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn -1\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes writing implementations for Haystack simple, but not type-safe:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Strings []string\r\n\r\nfunc (s Strings) Len() int                        { return len(s) }\r\nfunc (s Strings) Equal(i int, x interface{}) bool { return s[i] == x.(string) }\r\n\r\ntype Ints []int\r\n\r\nfunc (s Ints) Len() int                        { return len(s) }\r\nfunc (s Ints) Equal(i int, x interface{}) bool { return s[i] == x.(int) }\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n\tstrings := []string{&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;}\r\n\tfmt.Println(Search(Strings(strings), &quot;c&quot;)) // 2\r\n\tfmt.Println(Search(Strings(strings), &quot;e&quot;)) // -1\r\n\r\n\tints := []int{2, 1, 3, 4}\r\n\tfmt.Println(Search(Ints(ints), 3)) // 2\r\n\tfmt.Println(Search(Ints(ints), 5)) // -1\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the type assertions in the Equal methods. To make this type-safe we have to get rid of the `interface{}` argument to Equal:\r\n\r\n```go\r\ntype Haystack interface {\r\n    Len() int\r\n    Equal(int) bool\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc Search(haystack Haystack) int {\r\n    for i := 0; i &lt; haystack.Len(); i++ {\r\n        if haystack.Equal(i) {\r\n            return i\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return -1\r\n}\r\n\r\ntype Strings struct {\r\n    hs     []string\r\n    needle string\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (s Strings) Len() int         { return len(s.hs) }\r\nfunc (s Strings) Equal(i int) bool { return s.hs[i] == s.needle }\r\n\r\ntype Ints struct {\r\n    hs     []int\r\n    needle int\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc (s Ints) Len() int         { return len(s.hs) }\r\nfunc (s Ints) Equal(i int) bool { return s.hs[i] == s.needle }\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    strings := []string{&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;}\r\n    fmt.Println(Search(Strings{strings, &quot;c&quot;})) // 2\r\n    fmt.Println(Search(Strings{strings, &quot;e&quot;})) // -1\r\n\r\n    ints := []int{2, 1, 3, 4}\r\n    fmt.Println(Search(Ints{ints, 3})) // 2\r\n    fmt.Println(Search(Ints{ints, 5})) // -1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made both the interface implementations and using the Search function much more complicated. \r\n\r\nThe moral of the story is that using interfaces this way requires a sufficiently complicated algorithm to be worth the trouble. If writing the interface implementation for a particular type is more work than writing the concrete implementation for the algorithm, well, then just write the concrete functions you need:\r\n\r\n```go\r\nfunc SearchStr(haystack []string, needle string) int {\r\n    for i, x := range haystack {\r\n        if x == needle {\r\n            return i\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return -1\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc SearchInt(haystack []int, needle int) int {\r\n    for i, x := range haystack {\r\n        if x == needle {\r\n            return i\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return -1\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n    strings := []string{&quot;b&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;}\r\n    fmt.Println(SearchStr(strings, &quot;c&quot;)) // 2\r\n    fmt.Println(SearchStr(strings, &quot;e&quot;)) // -1\r\n\r\n    ints := []int{2, 1, 3, 4}\r\n    fmt.Println(SearchInt(ints, 3)) // 2\r\n    fmt.Println(SearchInt(ints, 5)) // -1\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008539/a-function-that-search-for-an-interface-over-a-slice-of-interface-in-go/58013414#58013414","title":"A function that search for an interface{} over a slice of interface{} in Go"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12405,"user_id":414813,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83284c54c3fc960dcdf8844ed92227d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CAFxX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/414813/cafxx"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12405,"user_id":414813,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83284c54c3fc960dcdf8844ed92227d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CAFxX","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/414813/cafxx"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568909860,"last_edit_date":1568909860,"creation_date":1568908748,"answer_id":58014906,"question_id":58008539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58014906","body_markdown":"Currently, it is not possible to build a solution that respects all your criteria. It will be possible once [generics][1] are implemented. Or you could try building one using `reflect`, but that will yield a complex and potentially slow solution... so I generally advise against using `reflect` for something as simple as this (see second snippet below).\r\n\r\nWhat you can do right now is to use something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc FindFirst(n int, f func(int) bool) int {\r\n    for i := 0; i &lt; n; i++ {\r\n        if f(i) {\r\n            return i\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return -1\r\n}\r\n\r\n// in your code (s is the slice, e the value you are searching for)\r\ni := FindFirst(len(s), func(i int) bool {\r\n    return s[i] == e\r\n})\r\nif i != -1 {\r\n    // i is the index of the element with value e\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis, as you can imagine, does not make much sense... as it&#39;s arguably simpler, faster, and **more idiomatic to simply write out the loop explicitly**:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// in your code (s is the slice, e the value you are searching for)\r\nfor i, v := range s {\r\n    if v == e {\r\n        _ = i // i is the index of the element with value e\r\n        break\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, this whole approach (linear scan) is only reasonable if the number of elements in the slice is small. If your slice is big and changes rarely, it would arguably make more sense (from a time complexity perspective) to sort it ([`sort.Slice`][2]) first and then do binary searches ([`sort.Search`][3]) on the sorted slice. Or, alternatively, you could use a `map` instead: in which case (assuming keys are small) lookup would be O(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blog.golang.org/why-generics\r\n  [2]:

our Python course, we were given this problem. We need to get accounts data from a file, perform some manipulations, and output the results...\r\nI&#39;ve tried to use the first value of the account as an initial minimum. It&#39;s not working. It does something I have no idea and just shuts off entire ```for ``` loop. \r\n\r\n```accounts.txt``` is a file that stores ID, savings type, and value. For example, \r\n```\r\n66096\td\t873323\r\n29615\tc\t849977\r\n45387\ts\t186640\r\n95384\tc\t933363\r\n13615\tc\t733321\r\n46396\tc\t714610\r\n17428\ts\t833671\r\n43730\td\t308296\r\n92061\tc\t670423\r\n51798\tc\t156063\r\n58083\ts\t940510\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, here&#39;s the code:\r\n```python\r\nfile=open(&#39;accounts.txt&#39;,mode=&#39;r&#39;)\r\nlinep=file.readlines()\r\nmins=linep[0].split()[2]\r\nsumc=0\r\nmaxc=0\r\nsums=0\r\nsumd=0\r\navrd=0\r\ncntr=0\r\nfor i in file:\r\n    if i.split()[1]==&#39;c&#39;:\r\n        sumc+=int(i.split()[2])\r\n        if int(i.split()[2])&gt;=maxc:\r\n            maxc=int(i.split()[2])\r\n    elif i.split()[1]==&#39;s&#39;:\r\n        sums+=int(i.split()[2])\r\n        if int(i.split()[2])&lt;=mins:\r\n            mins=int(i.split()[2])\r\n    elif i.split()[1]==&#39;d&#39;:\r\n        sumd+=int(i.split()[2])\r\n        cntr+=1\r\navrd=sums/cntr\r\nprint(&#39;The sum of all checking accounts is:&#39;,sumc)\r\nprint(&#39;The sum of all saving accounts is:&#39;,sums)\r\nprint(&#39;The sum of all deposit accounts is:&#39;,sumd)\r\nprint(&#39;The maximum balance for all checking accounts is:&#39;,maxc)\r\nprint(&#39;The minimum balance for all savings accounts is:&#39;,mins)\r\nprint(&#39;The average balance for all deposit accounts is:&#39;,avrd)\r\n```\r\nIt works when you set the ```mins=99999999999```, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, the output should&#39;ve been like this:\r\n```python\r\nThe sum of all checking accounts is: 209315463\r\nThe sum of all saving accounts is: 50272914\r\nThe sum of all deposit accounts is: 19976046\r\nThe maximum balance for all checking accounts is: 998992\r\nThe minimum balance for all savings accounts is: 150\r\nThe average balance for all deposit accounts is: 554890.1666666666\r\n```\r\nBut 2nd &amp; 3rd lines screw everything up, so I have this\r\n```python\r\nThe sum of all checking accounts is: 0\r\nThe sum of all saving accounts is: 0\r\nThe sum of all deposit accounts is: 0\r\nThe maximum balance for all checking accounts is: 0\r\nThe minimum balance for all savings accounts is: 873323\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, what do you think? I know, you can use min and max, but that&#39;s college we are talking about.

found an answer, but encountered a new problem.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon Kranti&#39;s code, the answer is as follows. \r\n\r\n    SELECT \r\n       EXTRACT(WEEK FROM starting_date) AS STARTDate, \r\n       EXTRACT(WEEK FROM ending_date) AS ENDDate,\r\n       discount_type,\r\n       COUNT(ID) AS total\r\n       FROM `event` \r\n       where starting_date &lt; ending_date\r\n       Group by 1,2\r\n\r\nWhat this gives me is the number of events that have happened from Week 1 - 3, Week 1-4 etc, so on and so forth. \r\n\r\nAfterwards, we do a left join with the weeks of interest, on the condition where the week numbers are in between STARTDate and ENDDate. Due to how a left join works, it will duplicate rows for all the rows that fulfill the specific condition. \r\n\r\nWe follow up with a groupby and sum, which will give us the number of events that were active, for each week. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58008498/how-to-get-the-number-of-active-events-happening-in-a-week-given-start-and-end-d/58072898#58072898","title":"How to get the number of active events happening in a week given start and end date (MYSQL)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10415971,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PvGdw9be7cI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/w7XPkvEhlM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Darren Lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10415971/darren-lim"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10415971,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-PvGdw9be7cI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADc/w7XPkvEhlM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Darren Lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10415971/darren-lim"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569297516,"creation_date":1568887316,"last_edit_date":1568891254,"question_id":58008498,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58008498","body_markdown":"This is the current table I have. \r\n\r\n\r\n    ID      Start_Date          End_Date\r\n    6446\t2018-01-01 00:00:00\t2018-04-01 00:00:00\r\n    6848\t2018-05-01 00:00:00\t2018-05-31 00:00:00\r\n    3269\t2016-11-09 00:00:00\t2016-11-21 00:00:00\r\n    7900\t2018-11-07 00:00:00\t2018-11-30 00:00:00\r\n    4006\t2017-04-06 00:00:00\t2017-04-30 00:00:00\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get the number of active events per week?

They have plenty of uses outside this code:\r\n\r\n  - `isInt` is simply a first-class function alias to `Number.isInteger`\r\n\r\n  - `path` finds the nested property of an object along a given pathway\r\n\r\n        path([&#39;b&#39;, 1, &#39;c&#39;], {a: 10, b: [{c: 20, d: 30}, {c: 40}], e: 50}) //=&gt; 40 \r\n\r\n  - `assoc` returns a new object cloning your original, but with the value of a certain property set to or replaced with the supplied one.\r\n\r\n        assoc(&#39;c&#39;, 42, {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4}) //=&gt; {a: 1, b: 2, c: 42, d: 4}\r\n\r\n    Note that internal objects are shared by reference where possible.\r\n\r\n  - `assocPath` does this same thing, but with a deeper path, building nodes as needed.\r\n\r\n        assocPath([&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, 1, &#39;c&#39;, &#39;d&#39;], 42, {a: {b: [{x: 1}, {x: 2}], e: 3})\r\n            //=&gt; {a: {b: [{x: 1}, {c: {d: 42}, x: 2}], e: 3}} \r\n\r\nExcept for `isInt`, these borrow their APIs from [Ramda][ra]. (Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Ramda author.)  But these are unique implementations.\r\n\r\nThe next function, `getPaths`, is an adaptation of one from [another SO answer][so].  It lists all the paths in your object in the format used by `path` and `assocPath`, returning an array of values which are integers if the relevant nested object is an array and strings otherwise.  Unlike the function from which is was borrowed, it only returns paths to leaf values.\r\n\r\nFor your original object, it returns an iterator for this data:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  [0, &quot;dog&quot;], \r\n  [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;x&quot;], \r\n  [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;], \r\n  [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;paw&quot;], \r\n  [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;a&quot;], \r\n  [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;dog&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;lion&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;m&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;paw&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;n&quot;], \r\n  [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to spend more time on this, I would replace that version of `getPaths` with a non-generator version, just to keep this code consistent.  It shouldn&#39;t be hard, but I&#39;m not interested in spending more time on it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t use those results directly to build your output, since they refer to array elements beyond the first one.  That&#39;s where `splitPaths` and its helper `canonicalPath` come in.  We create the canonical paths by replacing all integers with 0, giving us a data structure like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[{\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;dog&quot;],\r\n  path:      [0, &quot;dog&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;x&quot;],\r\n  path:      [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;x&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;], \r\n  path:      [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;paw&quot;],\r\n  path:      [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;paw&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;a&quot;], \r\n  path:      [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;a&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;b&quot;], \r\n  path:      [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;b&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;lion&quot;], \r\n  path:      [1, &quot;lion&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;m&quot;], \r\n  path:      [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;width&quot;, &quot;m&quot;]\r\n}, {\r\n  canonical: [0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;n&quot;], \r\n  path:      [1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 1, &quot;bengoltiger&quot;, &quot;height&quot;, &quot;n&quot;]\r\n}]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this function also removes duplicate canonical paths.  We originally had both `[0, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;]` and `[1, &quot;tiger&quot;, 0, &quot;indiantiger&quot;, &quot;foor&quot;]`, but the output only contains the first one.\r\n\r\nIt does this by storing them in an object under a key created by joining the path together with the non-printable character `\\u0000`.  This was the easiest way to accomplish this task, but there is an extremely unlikely failure mode possible &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; so if we really wanted we could do a more sophisticated duplicate checking.  I wouldn&#39;t bother.\r\n\r\nFinally, the main function, `canonicalRep` builds a representation out of your object by calling `splitPaths` and folding over the result, using `canonical` to say where to put the new data, and applying the `path` function to your `path` property and the original object.\r\n\r\nOur final output, as requested, looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n    {\r\n        dog: &quot;lmn&quot;,\r\n        lion: 90,\r\n        tiger: [\r\n            {\r\n                bengoltiger: {\r\n                    height: {\r\n                        n: 8,\r\n                        x: 4\r\n                    },\r\n                    width: {\r\n                        a: 8,\r\n                        m: 3\r\n                    }\r\n                },\r\n                indiantiger: {\r\n                    b: 3,\r\n                    foor: &quot;b&quot;,\r\n                    paw: &quot;a&quot;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s fascinating for me is that I saw this as an interesting programming challenge, although I couldn&#39;t really imagine any practical uses for it.  But now that I&#39;ve coded it, I realize it will solve a problem in my current project that I&#39;d put aside a few weeks ago.  I will probably implement this on Monday!\r\n\r\n----------\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;That failure mode could happen if you had certain nodes containing that separator, `\\u0000`.  For instance, if you had paths `[...nodes, &quot;abc\\u0000&quot;, &quot;def&quot;, ...nodes]` and `[...nodes, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;\\u0000def&quot;, ...nodes]`, they would both map to `&quot;...abc\\u0000\\u0000def...&quot;`.
