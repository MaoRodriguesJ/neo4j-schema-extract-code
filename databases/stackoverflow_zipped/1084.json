The following Java statements do NOT need to end with a semicolon:\r\n\r\n   - `if` statements\r\n   - some loop statements (`for`, `while`)\r\n   - `synchronized` statements\r\n   - `try` statements\r\n   - block statements; i.e. `{ ... }`\r\n\r\nThe thing that these all have in common is that they end in a subsidiary statement which may be either a block or not; e.g. \r\n\r\n    if (a) this.b();\r\n    \r\nversus \r\n\r\n    if (a) { this.b(); }\r\n\r\n&gt; But i&#39;ve also noticed many times on the internet that `public static void main`\r\nhas been called a statement although it doesn&#39;t have a semicolon.\r\n\r\nThat is not a statement.  It is a part of a declaration.  (A method declaration.)\r\n\r\n&gt; So, is there a definite term for statement? \r\n\r\nThe Java Language Specification says this:\r\n\r\n&gt;  *&quot;The sequence of execution of a program is controlled by statements, which are executed for their effect and do not have values.&quot;*\r\n\r\nSo from that we can extract the following loose definition: A statement is a Java language construct that is executable, is executed for its effect, and doesn&#39;t have a value&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that a better way to see the difference between a statement and a non-statement in Java is to list the different kinds of statements.\r\n\r\n   - Start with the list above.\r\n   - Add the following:\r\n      - local variable declarations (with or without initializers)\r\n      - calls to methods, method references and lambdas\r\n      - `new` statements\r\n      - assignment statements\r\n      - prefix / postfix increment and decrement expressions\r\n      - `do` ... `while` statements.\r\n      - `continue` and `break` statements\r\n      - `throw` statements\r\n      - `return` statements\r\n      - empty statements; e.g. the second `;` in `a = b; ;` \r\n\r\nNot-statements (declarations) include the following:\r\n\r\n   - A `class` declaration\r\n   - An `interface` declaration\r\n   - An `enum` declaration\r\n   - A field declaration\r\n   - A method declaration\r\n   - A constructor declaration\r\n   - A `package` declaration\r\n   - An `import` declaration\r\n   - A `module` declaration\r\n   - An initializer block.\r\n\r\n(Some people call `package`, `import` and `module` declarations &quot;statements&quot;, but that is not what the JLS calls them, and that doesn&#39;t fit the definition above.)\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any difference between statement and instruction in Java?\r\n\r\nThe term &quot;instruction&quot; doesn&#39;t have any technical meaning in Java.  However, a Java statement is a form of instruction to the program to do something.\r\n\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1 - The &quot;doesn&#39;t have a value&quot; is a bit of a stretch.  For example, a statement such a `i++;` does produce a value ... but we are ignoring it.  However, the above is a direct quotation from the JLS, albeit that it is descriptive rather than a serious attempt to define &quot;statement&quot;.&lt;/sup&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284618/java-statements-and-instructions/58286780#58286780","title":"Java statements and instructions"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10433957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-99EX3aqu4Rw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXYGHxH53eacnnqXP67hUBNE8KpLg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jayesh Sonkusare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10433957/jayesh-sonkusare"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58286780,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570603179,"creation_date":1570530721,"question_id":58284618,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284618","body_markdown":"I read that all Java statements end with a semicolon.

The implicit definition of a copy\r\n&gt; assignment operator as defaulted is deprecated if the class has a\r\n&gt; user-declared copy constructor or a user-declared destructor (15.4,\r\n&gt; 15.8). In a future revision of this International Standard, these implicit definitions could become deleted (11.4).\r\n\r\nThis gives the answer to \r\n\r\n**1.: Both compilers are correct, clang actually warns you about the deprecation, gcc does not which is also okay.**\r\n\r\nThis is ok because D(0) make a warning about it optional, also even the `[[deprecated]]` attribute, which also is not mandatory to issue a warning:\r\n\r\n&gt; An implementation may declare library names and entities described in\r\n&gt; this section with the deprecated attribute\r\n\r\n**2. To force you to think about the so called [*Rule of Three*][1]:**\r\nThe rule of three states that since you need to define a constructor you probably you need a complex copy and or move constructor. By forcing you to explicit defining them, even with `default`, it acts as a insurance, the class author has thought about slicing and other problems. However since the implicit or defaulted copy constructor just copies your bases and elements, you should be fine.\r\n\r\nYou can *default*, which basically does the same as the implict defined things, but you want a virtual destructor, which is otherwise the same:\r\n\r\n    exception() noexcept = default;\r\n    exception(const exception&amp;) noexcept = default;\r\n    virtual ~exception() noexcept = default;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/rule_of_three","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284598/user-defined-empty-constructors-in-custom-exception-with-multiple-inheritance-an/58285299#58285299","title":"User-defined empty constructors in custom exception with multiple inheritance and abstract base class"}],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":12124759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16e152dcd0efc448c3f32260f3bfd7a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Baptistou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12124759/baptistou"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570619005,"accepted_answer_id":58285299,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570535485,"creation_date":1570530653,"question_id":58284598,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284598","body_markdown":"I designed several custom exceptions which all inherit from the same abstract base class ```custom::exception``` and from the corresponding standard [exception][1] thanks to multiple inheritance.\r\nThus there is a specific hierarchy in my custom exceptions and I can catch them generically or specifically.\r\n\r\nNow I switched on all warnings without any problem with GCC but clang complains about the virtual destructor :\r\n```cpp\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdexcept&gt;\r\n\r\nnamespace custom {\r\n    struct exception;\r\n    struct buffer_overflow;\r\n    struct null_pointer;\r\n    struct out_of_range;\r\n    //...\r\n}\r\n\r\nstruct custom::exception {\r\n    virtual ~exception() noexcept {}\r\n    virtual const char* what() const noexcept = 0;\r\n};\r\n\r\nstruct custom::null_pointer : public custom::exception, public std::logic_error {\r\n    null_pointer(const std::string &amp;str): std::logic_error(str) {}\r\n    const char* what() const noexcept override { return std::logic_error::what(); }\r\n};\r\n\r\nint main(){\r\n    try{\r\n        throw custom::null_pointer(&quot;[ERROR] NULL pointer exception !&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    catch(const custom::exception &amp;error){\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; error.what() &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOutput with g++ *(MinGW.org GCC-8.2.0-3)* :\r\n```\r\n[ERROR] NULL pointer exception !\r\n```\r\nOutput with clang++ *version 6.0.0-1ubuntu2* :\r\n```\r\ntest.cpp:13:13: warning: definition of implicit copy constructor for &#39;exception&#39; is deprecated because it has a\r\n      user-declared destructor [-Wdeprecated]\r\n    virtual ~exception() noexcept {}\r\n            ^\r\ntest.cpp:17:16: note: in implicit copy constructor for &#39;custom::exception&#39; first required here\r\nstruct custom::null_pointer : public custom::exception, public std::logic_error {\r\n               ^\r\ntest.cpp:24:15: note: in implicit move constructor for &#39;custom::null_pointer&#39; first required here\r\n        throw custom::null_pointer(&quot;[ERROR] NULL pointer exception !&quot;);\r\n              ^\r\n1 warning generated.\r\n[ERROR] NULL pointer exception !\r\n```\r\nI do not really understand because ```custom::exception``` is abstract and does not contain any member variable so it does not need user-defined constructors.

At the moment I am using Cisco AnyConnect, which upon connection asks me the host server, my username, my password and routes all my traffic through the VPN afterwards. \r\n\r\nThe problem is, depending on what I&#39;m doing I often need to jump back and forth to VPN (some applications need local network and others dont)\r\n\r\nWhat would be perfect is to create one VPN connection and just keep it on a port without routing anything to it. Then I can use it as a proxy to selectively route my traffic through VPN (eg. I override http_proxy locally on one terminal instance and run applications that require VPN through there without having to jump back and forth). Furthermore if I create this connection from the terminal I can automate most of the process, with something like:\r\n```\r\nfunction callExecutableThroughVPN() {\r\n  if ! is_connected_to_vpn then\r\n    echo &quot;coulnt find the vpn connection, will attempt to connect. enter password:&quot;\r\n    # get password input here\r\n    setup_vpn_on_port_9876 # pass password input here\r\n\r\n    echo &quot;setting proxy to 127.0.0.1:9876&quot;\r\n    http_proxy=127.0.0.1:9876/\r\n    https_proxy=127.0.0.1:9876/\r\n  fi\r\n\r\n  ./executable_that_need_vpn\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen I can simply stay on my network and use a wrapper like above for few processes that require their traffic re-routed. \r\n\r\nSo in summary, my question is: Is it possible to create a single VPN process through terminal to listen a local port, so I dont have to route all my traffic at once, and I can simply kill this process when I&#39;m done","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284588/how-to-create-a-vpn-connection-on-a-port-and-only-use-it-selectively","title":"How to create a vpn connection on a port and only use it selectively"},{"tags":["android","opencv","image-processing","camera","tensorflow-lite"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":569,"user_id":5356862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ks8Bh.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"majid ghafouri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5356862/majid-ghafouri"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570530958,"post_id":58284587,"comment_id":102934417,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284587/how-to-compare-two-images-in-android-get-result-as-presentage-in-android#comment102934417_58284587"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":8518299,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92ded24b33f2c4545884a1efa5769f98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nadeesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8518299/nadeesh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2531,"user_id":818832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vXSKH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/818832/peter"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570536461,"creation_date":1570530603,"last_edit_date":1570536461,"question_id":58284587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284587","body_markdown":"I want to make a tree identity using the leaves.

I&#39;d like both of those to need auth.  I&#39;m (almost) able to get them running fine behind keycloak and keycloak gatekeeper using a single realm and a confidential client.  In this case gatekeeper has an `upstream-url` that is a traefik instance, that then routes to either the UI or API docker container.  Something like:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gatekeeper upstream-url ----&gt; Traefik (my.domain/*)  ----&gt; UI (my.domain/ui/*)\r\n                                                         \\---&gt; API (my.domain/api/*)\r\n\r\nThis works fine until the session times out, and when the user on the (already loaded) UI page clicks a button that tries to send an ajax request to hit the API (eg https://my.domain/api/getstuff), then Gatekeeper redirects (ie 301) that to the the keycloak login page.  This redirect is a little nonsensical for an API request...\r\n\r\nAt this point both my UI and API projects are auth agnostic (ie they are not running any of the adapters etc just yet - I&#39;m relying on the docker setup to prevent &quot;direct&quot; access to UI and API for now.

I can see in https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/index.html#configuration-options the `autodetect-bearer-only` option which seems to describe my issue, ie \r\n\r\n&gt; It allows you to redirect unauthenticated users of the web application to the Keycloak login page, but send an HTTP 401 status code to unauthenticated SOAP or REST clients instead as they would not understand a redirect to the login page\r\n\r\nbut seems to apply at the adapter layer, ie after gatekeeper in my scenario.\r\n[this][1] seems similar too.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I want unauthenticated (eg never logged in, or timed out) access requests to https://my.domain/ui/* to be redirected to the keycloak login page, but https://my.domain/api/* to 401.\r\n\r\nAnd from https://my.domain/ui/somepage the ajax request to https://my.domain/api/getstuff to use the JWT/token/cookie that the browser has from the login (which is working now).\r\n\r\nHow do I do this?

With that said, if your app is containerized you can use ECS or Elastic Beanstalk.  If your application is stateless (you don&#39;t need local disk storage this is persistent between restarts of your application, you can still use a database or other services for storage) the easiest is probably ECS using Fargate tasks.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous blogs and tutorials online because, as you&#39;ve already said, there are very many different types of applications, deployment and configuration options.  Start reading some blogs and the docs for using docker compose to deploy contained to AWS.\r\n\r\nA place to get started might be here.\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-cli-tutorial-fargate.html\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nI see you cross posted here https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/issues/231. The OP there said they used a VM. In AWS this is an EC2 instance. The get started https://github.com/jsbroks/coco-annotator/wiki/Getting-Started#dedicated-servervps-setup also says this requires a dedicated server or VSP. That would also point to EC2. If you want to use ECS or Beanstalk you need to deploy a container. I don&#39;t know if this app supports running in a container and if you want to pursue that routeyour best place to ask is probably in that projects community not SO.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284567/how-to-run-docker-compose-web-application-on-aws/58284959#58284959","title":"How to run `docker-compose` web application on AWS?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2390,"user_id":2191652,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cfa80e86236c34a19d11dfa54262d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mcExchange","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2191652/mcexchange"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2390,"user_id":2191652,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cfa80e86236c34a19d11dfa54262d40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mcExchange","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2191652/mcexchange"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570544441,"answer_count":1,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571648573,"creation_date":1570530503,"last_edit_date":1571648573,"question_id":58284567,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284567","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using an image annotation tool ([coco-annotator][1] based on Vue.js) locally and I would like to run it on a AWS webserver, to be able to access it from anywhere.\r\nThe source code contains some docker files and can locally be run using  \r\n\r\n    docker-compose up\r\n\r\nDoes someone know, what are the high-level steps to run this application on a AWS webserver?\r\nAWS seems quite complicated as it has a million options, so I&#39;d like to know  \r\n\r\n 1.

Removing on the other hand is trickier - you can call `shutdownNow`. Javadoc:\r\n\r\n&gt; Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts theprocessing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution. \r\n\r\nHowever `shutdownNow()` will actually shut down the executor, so it&#39;ll refuse to accept new tasks. Also, note the word *attempts* in the Javadoc. Once a task started executing, there&#39;s no guarantee it can be easily stopped. Tasks can ignore `interrupt` and keep running.\r\n\r\nIf you want more granular control, don&#39;t use an `ExecutorService`. Instead, try a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, which implements `ExecutorService`. In a `ThreadPoolExecutor` you have direct access to the queue of Runnables.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284559/how-to-remove-all-the-running-and-queued-tasks-in-executorservice-and-add-new-ta/58284664#58284664","title":"how to remove all the running and queued tasks in ExecutorService and add new tasks into it?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7650603,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c1ae0cd753a5fe5a8c486cb3838dc22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ejxqy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7650603/ejxqy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570615269,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570530877,"creation_date":1570530485,"question_id":58284559,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284559","body_markdown":"how to remove all the running and queued tasks in ```ExecutorService``` and add new tasks into it?\r\n\r\nThere is a ```ExecutorService``` to deal with the new tasks coming in each round.&lt;br&gt;\r\nIf tasks are not done in this round, remove these old tasks and add news coming tasks in next round. ```ExecutorService``` will be reused in next round, so ```ExecutorService``` cannot be shutdown.&lt;br&gt;\r\nAnybody knows how to do it?&lt;br&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284559/how-to-remove-all-the-running-and-queued-tasks-in-executorservice-and-add-new-ta","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"how to remove all the running and queued tasks in ExecutorService and add new tasks into it?"},{"tags":["html","css-selectors","jsoup"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":779,"user_id":6592881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciVbN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sfili_81","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6592881/sfili-81"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570530607,"post_id":58284558,"comment_id":102934247,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284558/jsoup-select-for-quoted-text#comment102934247_58284558"},{"owner":{"reputation":132,"user_id":9319845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2032898223655461/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alfred Moon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9319845/alfred-moon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":779,"user_id":6592881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciVbN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sfili_81","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6592881/sfili-81"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570530857,"post_id":58284558,"comment_id":102934374,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284558/jsoup-select-for-quoted-text#comment102934374_58284558"},{"owner":{"reputation":779,"user_id":6592881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciVbN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sfili_81","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6592881/sfili-81"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570535004,"post_id":58284558,"comment_id":102936210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284558/jsoup-select-for-quoted-text#comment102936210_58284558"}],"owner":{"reputation":132,"user_id":9319845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2032898223655461/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alfred Moon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9319845/alfred-moon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":132,"user_id":9319845,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2032898223655461/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alfred Moon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9319845/alfred-moon"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570530667,"creation_date":1570530484,"last_edit_date":1570530667,"question_id":58284558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284558","body_markdown":"I have html tag like this:\r\n\r\n```&lt;img src=&quot;/someLink&quot; class=&quot;class&quot; alt=&quot;some info &quot;quoted info&quot;, some info&quot; /&gt;```\r\n\r\nI need to select this tag by &#39;alt&#39; value by the means of jsoup.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried these options:\r\n\r\n```img[alt=&quot;some info &quot;quoted info&quot;, some info&quot;]``` \r\n\r\n```img[alt=&quot;some info \\&quot;quoted info\\&quot;, some info&quot;]```\r\n\r\nNothing worked. \r\n\r\nPlease explain - how to properly select some element by parameter that includes quotation marks ?

you look at [the documentation for `INSERT`](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_insert.html), you&#39;ll see it should be `INSERT OR REPLACE ...`, and, yes, it&#39;ll work to replace null values in the not-null column with the default value.\r\n\r\n[Replace conflict resolution documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_conflict.html):\r\n\r\n&gt; When a UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint violation occurs, the REPLACE algorithm deletes pre-existing rows that are causing the constraint violation prior to inserting or updating the current row and the command continues executing normally. **If a NOT NULL constraint violation occurs, the REPLACE conflict resolution replaces the NULL value with the default value for that column**, or if the column has no default value, then the ABORT algorithm is used. If a CHECK constraint or foreign key constraint violation occurs, the REPLACE conflict resolution algorithm works like ABORT.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    sqlite&gt; CREATE TABLE foo(x, y NOT NULL DEFAULT 1);\r\n    sqlite&gt; INSERT INTO foo(x,y) VALUES (&#39;a&#39;, null);\r\n    Error: NOT NULL constraint failed: foo.y\r\n    sqlite&gt; INSERT OR REPLACE INTO foo(x,y) VALUES (&#39;a&#39;, null);\r\n    sqlite&gt; SELECT * FROM foo;\r\n    x           y         \r\n    ----------  ----------\r\n    a           1         \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284552/copying-an-sqlite-table-applying-default-values/58284859#58284859","title":"Copying an SQLite Table Applying Default Values"}],"owner":{"reputation":1127,"user_id":3386180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a7db46bc4ee7ea2626753ba7679e5d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jerry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3386180/jerry"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58284859,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570531940,"creation_date":1570530474,"question_id":58284552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284552","body_markdown":"I have an SQLite database in my Android app that I would like to update.

On the other hand, if you look at the `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces` listing, you can see there are quite a few pods involved to run the core Kubernetes system (and several of those are replicated on each node in a multi-node installation).\r\n\r\nIf 2 cores isn&#39;t enough, you can try picking larger instance sizes; if 2x m5.large works then 1x m5.2xlarge will be slightly better and the same cost.  If you&#39;re just running demo applications like this then the &quot;c&quot; family has half the memory (2 GiB per core) and is slightly cheaper so you might try a c5.2xlarge.\r\n\r\nFor medium-sized workloads, I&#39;d suggest figuring out your total cluster requirements (based on either pods&#39; resource requests or actual statistics from a tool like Prometheus); dividing that across some number of worker nodes, such that losing one won&#39;t be a significant problem (maybe 7 or 9); then selecting the instance size that fits that.  It will be easier to run on fewer, larger nodes than more, smaller nodes (there are more places to fit that one pod that requires 8 GB of RAM).\r\n\r\n(I routinely need to allocate 4-8 GB of memory for desktop environments like Docker Desktop for Mac or [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) and still find it cramped; CPU isn&#39;t usually my limitation but I could easily believe that 2 cores and 8 GiB of RAM isn&#39;t enough.)\r\n\r\n(And yes, AWS is pretty expensive for personal projects without an obvious revenue stream attached to them.  You could get that m5.large instance for about $500/year if you were willing to pay that amount up front but that can still be a lot of money to just play around with things.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284524/what-is-the-recommended-ec2-instance-for-istio-bookinfo-sample-application/58285263#58285263","title":"What is the recommended EC2 instance for Istio bookinfo sample application?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570533620,"creation_date":1570533620,"answer_id":58285369,"question_id":58284524,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58285369","body_markdown":"&gt; The deployment is made up of a different number of components.

There is not even a log entry saying &quot;**Redirect Found**&quot; Here&#39;s the ```&lt;dependentAssembly&gt;``` element from web.config: \r\n\r\n        &lt;assemblyIdentity name=&quot;System.Web.Http&quot; publicKeyToken=&quot;31bf3856ad364e35&quot; culture=&quot;neutral&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;bindingRedirect oldVersion=&quot;0.0.0.0-5.2.7.0&quot; newVersion=&quot;5.2.7.0&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nThe same application with identical web.config works fine on my local environment. Here&#39;s the FusionLog form my local machine, notice the highlighted log entries: \r\n\r\n![screenshot of my local environment binding works](https://i.imgur.com/RaEma8R.png).\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve examined machine.config and Framework64\\config\\web.config files on both environment and I can&#39;t spot any relevant differences. \r\n\r\nWhy would the binder/loader not find (or ignore) the &lt;bindingRedirect&gt;

One of the GoogleMock policies is that in case of possible ambiguity it&#39;s better to throw an error an make user state his intention explicitly.\r\n\r\nAdding `EXPECT_CALL` macro effectively says &quot;I care about calls of this method&quot;. Whenever `EXPECT_CALL` is set, GoogleMock will try to match every `EXPECT_CALL` it has seen in reverse order of declaration (so the latest defined expects are matched first).  \r\nOne of the reasons for this design is to allow overriding less specific expects with more specific ones (e.g. in constructor of test fixture you set less restrictive expects, but for certain tests you want to match more precisely). [Documentation](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/for_dummies.md#using-multiple-expectations-multiexpectations).\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a way of &quot;ignoring&quot; already fulfilled expectations by adding [`.RetiresOnSaturation()`](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googlemock/docs/cook_book.md#controlling-when-an-expectation-retires)\r\n\r\n    TEST_F(FooBarTest, OnCallExpectCallSameMethod)\r\n    {\r\n        Foo foo(barMock);\r\n        ON_CALL(barMock, doBar(5)).WillByDefault(testing::Return(true));\r\n        EXPECT_CALL(barMock, doBar(7))\r\n            .WillOnce(testing::Return(true))\r\n            .RetiresOnSaturation();\r\n    \r\n        foo.doFoo();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`RetiresOnSaturation()` will make expectations retired after it has been saturated (i.e. called as many time as expected). GoogleMock will skip over retired expectations as long as there are still any non-retired ones (if all of them are retired then it still prints an error).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you however need to accept calls `doBar(5)` *before* `doBar(7)`, then the only way to do so is to define it as expectation as well:\r\n\r\n    TEST_F(FooBarTest, OnCallExpectCallSameMethod)\r\n    {\r\n        Foo foo(barMock);\r\n        EXPECT_CALL(barMock, doBar(5)).WillRepeatedly(testing::Return(true));\r\n        EXPECT_CALL(barMock, doBar(7))\r\n            .WillOnce(testing::Return(true))\r\n            .RetiresOnSaturation();\r\n    \r\n        foo.doFoo();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`RetiresOnSaturation()` is still needed because of LIFO (last in, first out) processing of expectations.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284511/on-call-and-expect-call-on-same-method-with-different-parameter-matchers-generat/58317042#58317042","title":"ON_CALL AND EXPECT_CALL on same method with different parameter matchers generates saturated and active error"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":2705634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/434be29a7b5480cc2565bdcb4e8366e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex Damian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705634/alex-damian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":2705634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/434be29a7b5480cc2565bdcb4e8366e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex Damian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705634/alex-damian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58317042,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570690246,"creation_date":1570530311,"last_edit_date":1570603956,"question_id":58284511,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284511","body_markdown":"In this example bellow I will obtain the following behavior:\r\n\r\n*EXPECT_CALL(barMock, doBar(7))...\r\nExpected arg #0: is equal to 7\r\nActual: 5\r\nExpected: to be called once\r\nActual: called once - saturated and active*\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;gmock/gmock.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;gtest/gtest.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    class IBar\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        virtual bool doBar(int barParam) = 0;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class BarMock : public IBar\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        MOCK_METHOD1(doBar, bool(int));\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class Foo\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        Foo(IBar&amp; bar_)\r\n            : bar{ &amp;bar_ }\r\n        {\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n        void doFoo()\r\n        {\r\n            bar-&gt;doBar(7);\r\n            bar-&gt;doBar(5);\r\n        }\r\n        IBar* bar;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    class FooBarTest : public ::testing::Test\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n        void SetUp() override\r\n        {\r\n            ON_CALL(barMock, doBar(testing::_)).WillByDefault(testing::Return(true));\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        testing::NiceMock&lt;BarMock&gt; barMock;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    TEST_F(FooBarTest, OnCallExpectCallSameMethod)\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n        Foo               foo(barMock);\r\n    \r\n        ON_CALL(barMock, doBar(5)).WillByDefault(testing::Return(true));\r\n        EXPECT_CALL(barMock, doBar(7)).WillOnce(testing::Return(true));\r\n    \r\n        foo.doFoo();\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nGoogle test versions tested:\r\n\r\n - 1.8.0\r\n - 1.8.1\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n 1.

Because the value of your portfolio constituents changes daily, so do the weights.  `port_beta` is the beta of your portfolio value across time to `market` whereas `calc_beta` is the weighted sum of beta across portfolio constituents.  The difference arises primarily due to the fact that `calc_beta` is computed using the current weights whereas `port_beta` is calculated across the historical weights.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284469/why-dont-these-betas-match/58302514#58302514","title":"Why don&#39;t these betas match?"}],"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":7204030,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Nw__Kd4Q4g4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGqk/fk2sKIXn4J4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"dsugasa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7204030/dsugasa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":192,"user_id":7204030,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Nw__Kd4Q4g4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGqk/fk2sKIXn4J4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"dsugasa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7204030/dsugasa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58302514,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570618294,"creation_date":1570530118,"last_edit_date":1570532575,"question_id":58284469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284469","body_markdown":"I also asked on Quant Finance, but I thought someone could help here also:\r\nhttps://quant.stackexchange.com/questions/49099/why-dont-these-betas-match\r\n\r\nI would expect my portfolio beta when regressed against the market to match my individual component betas multiplied by the portfolio weights.

have two remotes `one` and `two`. From time to time, the remote `two` gets new branches which are named in certain way, say `release/*`.\r\n\r\nIf there is a branch for instance `release/y` in `two`, but not in `one` I need to pull the &quot;new&quot; branches, but leave the &quot;old&quot; branches as they are.\r\n\r\nSo if there would be a branch `release/x` in `one`, but `release/y` and `release/z` are not, then will just add

foreground service performs some operation that is noticeable to the user. For example, an audio app would use a foreground service to play an audio track. Foreground services must display a **Notification**. Foreground services continue running even when the user isn&#39;t interacting with the app.\r\n\r\nSo with other words, you&#39;ll need to provide an icon for the notification, so the user is informed that the app is consuming resources.\r\n\r\nAccording to your comment:\r\n\r\n&gt; Nope I want to listen for new documents created in Firestore.\r\n\r\nYes, you can have a listener attached to some document in your database or even to a query, and it will update as the results change. But remeber that you will have to pay a read operation for each of the updates that you get, basically meaning that the user will also have the cost for the bandwidth, and the cost of their battery drain. So I always recommend [remove the listeners according to the life-cycler of the activity](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48699032/how-to-set-addsnapshotlistener-and-remove-in-populateviewholder-in-recyclerview/).\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s a way in which you you deal with Firestore when you want to listen to some documents in a background but please also consider using [Cloud Functions for Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions):\r\n\r\n&gt; Cloud Functions for Firebase let you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. Your code is stored in Google&#39;s cloud and runs in a managed environment. There&#39;s no need to manage and scale your own servers.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\n&gt; How do Cloud Functions actually work?\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the client, Cloud Functions also allows you to attach a listener to a single document or even to a query. So a Cloud Function can be triggered when something special in your database happens, for instance when some documents gets written into a Firestore collection. Once the function is triggered, you can take some action. As Frank van Puffelen mentioned in his comment, you can send a notification for example. For Android, please see below a straightforward example:\r\n\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48298993/push-notifications-on-content-change/48299840\r\n\r\nMaybe this is not what you want, to send a notification but it&#39;s a simple example and I think you&#39;ll be able to get the idea.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58284392/how-to-create-firebase-background-service-in-android/58284846#58284846","title":"How to create firebase background service in Android?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2237,"user_id":2381453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2bN5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vicky Thakor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2381453/vicky-thakor"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570542247,"creation_date":1570529817,"question_id":58284392,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58284392","body_markdown":"I&#39;m newbie to Android.

attempting to write a small program to &quot;Stained Glassify&quot; a basic image, but during the last step of this (shading the image), resulting images are sometimes getting badly distorted.\r\n\r\nThe process I&#39;m using for this is loosely as follows:\r\n\r\n- Outline each region (single coloured area) of the image\r\n- Apply a &quot;mask&quot; over each region to give the &quot;stained glass&quot; look\r\n- Slightly brighten/darken each new region to give the desired effect\r\n\r\nFor the last step, I&#39;m simply multiplying the red/green/blue portion of each pixel in a region by some random number within a given range. When I extend this range too far, the image gets badly distorted.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried forcing extreme values for the shading (on the upper end of the ranges that cause the problems), but they don&#39;t cause any problems seemingly.\r\n\r\n```C\r\n// These structs are in draw.h and bitmaps.h respectively\r\nstruct point\r\n{\r\n    int x;\r\n    int y;\r\n};\r\n\r\nunion bmp_colour\r\n{\r\n    struct\r\n    {\r\n        uint8_t r;\r\n        uint8_t g;\r\n        uint8_t b;\r\n        uint8_t reserved;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    uint32_t colour;\r\n};\r\n\r\n// bitmaps.c\r\nunion bmp_colour get_pixel(struct bitmap bmp, int x, int y)\r\n{\r\n    uint32_t width = bmp.info.width;\r\n    uint32_t height = bmp.info.height;\r\n\r\n    if (x &gt;= width || y &gt;= height || x &lt; 0 || y &lt; 0) {\r\n        union bmp_colour pixel;\r\n        pixel.colour = 0x000000;\r\n        pixel.reserved = 1;\r\n        return pixel;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return bmp.bits[x + y * width];\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid set_pixel(struct bitmap bmp, int x, int y, uint32_t colour)\r\n{\r\n    uint32_t width = bmp.info.width;\r\n    uint32_t height = bmp.info.height;\r\n\r\n    if (x &gt;= width || y &gt;= height || x &lt; 0 || y &lt; 0) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    bmp.bits[x + y * width].colour = colour;\r\n    return;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// draw.c\r\nvoid shade(struct bitmap bmp, double variance)\r\n{\r\n    // A flag for each pixel to indicate if it was processed\r\n    uint8_t *flags = calloc(bmp.info.bmp_size / 3, sizeof(uint8_t));\r\n    // A queue for pixels in the current region that still need to be processed\r\n    struct point *queue = malloc(bmp.info.bmp_size * sizeof(struct point) / 3);\r\n    \r\n    // Loop over every pixel\r\n    for (int y = 0; y &lt; bmp.info.height; y++) {\r\n        for (int x = 0; x &lt; bmp.info.width; x++) {\r\n            // If this pixel is already done, skip it\r\n            if (flags[x + y * bmp.info.width]) {\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n            int qp = 0; // Queue pointer/position\r\n\r\n            // Get the colour to shade next, skip if black or invalid pixel\r\n            union bmp_colour target = get_pixel(bmp, x, y);\r\n            if (target.colour == 0x000000 || target.reserved) {\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Get the colour to fill this region with\r\n            union bmp_colour fill_col = { .colour = target.colour };\r\n            double var = rand_between(1 - variance, 1 + variance);\r\n            fill_col.r = (int) clamp(var * fill_col.r, 0x00, 0xff);\r\n            fill_col.g = (int) clamp(var * fill_col.g, 0x00, 0xff);\r\n            fill_col.b = (int) clamp(var * fill_col.b, 0x00, 0xff);\r\n\r\n            // Add the current point to the queue\r\n            queue[qp] = (struct point) { .x = x, .y = y}; \r\n\r\n            do {\r\n                int cx = queue[qp].x, cy = queue[qp].y;\r\n                // Mark this pixel as done\r\n                flags[cx + cy * bmp.info.width] = 1;\r\n                \r\n                // Set this pixel to the new colour\r\n                set_pixel(bmp, cx, cy, fill_col.colour);\r\n\r\n                // Get each surrounding pixel\r\n                union bmp_colour left = get_pixel(bmp, cx + 1, cy);\r\n                union bmp_colour right = get_pixel(bmp, cx - 1, cy);\r\n                union bmp_colour up = get_pixel(bmp, cx, cy + 1);\r\n                union bmp_colour down = get_pixel(bmp, cx, cy - 1);\r\n\r\n                // For each surrounding pixel, if it is the &quot;target&quot; colour,\r\n                // add it to the queue and increment qp\r\n                if (!left.reserved &amp;&amp; left.colour == target.colour\r\n                        &amp;&amp; flags[cx + 1 + cy * bmp.info.width] == 0) {\r\n                    queue[qp++] = (struct point) { .x = cx + 1, .y = cy };\r\n                }\r\n                if (!right.reserved &amp;&amp; right.colour == target.colour\r\n                        &amp;&amp; flags[cx - 1 + cy * bmp.info.width] == 0) {\r\n                    queue[qp++] = (struct point) { .x = cx - 1, .y = cy };\r\n                }\r\n                if (!up.reserved &amp;&amp; up.colour == target.colour\r\n                        &amp;&amp; flags[cx + (cy + 1) * bmp.info.width] == 0) {\r\n                    queue[qp++] = (struct point) { .x = cx, .y = cy + 1 };\r\n                }\r\n                if (!down.reserved &amp;&amp; down.colour == target.colour\r\n                        &amp;&amp; flags[cx + (cy - 1) * bmp.info.width] == 0) {\r\n                    queue[qp++] = (struct point) { .x = cx, .y = cy - 1 };\r\n                }\r\n            } while (qp-- &gt; 0); // Repeat until the queue is empty\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf ```shade``` is called with any value up to about 0.25 (slightly less), the function works as expected, but any higher value usually (but not always) distorts the image.
