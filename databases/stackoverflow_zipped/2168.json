I need to parse the raw text and titles (which are in the name of the document itself, not the first line in the document) to make a corpus which is going to be used later on to train the NLP-model.\r\n\r\nSince I&#39;m a newbie I have a lot to learn. So I&#39;ve already done a lot of research on this topic. In the beginning It was a pain in the *** for me to convert all these .doc-files to .docx-files but I&#39;ve finaly found a way to do that. \r\nSince I need to get the title and text from a bunch of documents I assumed that I need to &#39;walk&#39; over the documents in the folder, using a for-loop, which I did like this: \r\n\r\n```python\r\npath = &#39;/path/to/folder&#39;\r\nfor filename in os.listdir(path):\r\n    if filename.endswith(&#39;.docx&#39;):\r\n        path = os.path.join(path, filename)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI&#39;ve also tried what I found in this stackoverflow-link (using the native python-docx module): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/125222/extracting-text-from-ms-word-files-in-python\r\n\r\nBut this gave me this TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, bytes found\r\n\r\n**edit:**\r\nThe TypeError problem is solved, I tried again 3 different ways to extract text from a Word Document and thisone gave me the best output (without errors): \r\n\r\n    &#180;&#180;&#180;\r\n    import docx\r\n    def getText(filename):\r\n        doc = docx.Document(filename)\r\n        fullText = []\r\n        for para in doc.paragraphs:\r\n        fullText.append(para.text)\r\n    return &#39;\\n&#39;.join(fullText)\r\n    \r\n    print(getText(&#39;test.docx&#39;))\r\n\r\n&#180;&#180;&#180;\r\nSo now I (finaly) know how to do a good text-extraction from a Word document. I still need to figure out how to do this on a whole folder and what are my next steps in the proces in order to make a corpus that will be used for NLP.\r\n\r\nBtw. I&#39;m using Pycharm in a Ubuntu 18.04 virtual machine and Python version 3.6.\r\n\r\n(I&#39;ve also explained my problem a bit in a different way in this post https://python-forum.io/Thread-Data-extraction-from-multiple-MS-Word-file-s-in-python (see comment #9). I posted this yesterday, it was before trying out what I&#39;ve found in the stackoverflow-link.)\r\n\r\nCould anyone give me any idea about what is a good way to extract titles from MS Word document in order to make a corpus of files to use in SpaCy? \r\n\r\nThank you very much to take your time.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025316/how-to-make-a-corpus-of-files-in-text-format-based-on-parse-of-text-titles-fro","title":"How to make a corpus of files in text-format based on parse of text &amp; titles from MS Word documents in Python?"},{"tags":["ssl","nginx","centos7","certbot","gtmetrix"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12094491,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Pc7yZ-J0_9w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdAW490l9bWf1-azoWiQ68qTh6-ZA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pedram Soltani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094491/pedram-soltani"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568970681,"creation_date":1568970681,"question_id":58025315,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025315","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using the following recommended ssl configuration for my nginx server.

However, for whatever reason, during mounting only `/config` has the required owner and group (`999:1000` or `jvb:jitsi`) while the content of `/config` still has `root:root`. Then, I&#39;ve tried to mount file by file (see below), but ansible refused to let me do this.

Some values depend on data that only becomes available later (in real-time). I would like to create a &quot;contract&quot; for this data in the array, and then later when the data is available, swap out the &quot;contract&quot; object for the actual data. So if it is a Contract&lt;string&gt;, then I can change the Contract&lt;string&gt; to a string later on. *I am using the term &quot;contract&quot; here in a unique way, not necessarily relevant to any other uses of the term that you may be familiar with. I&#39;m open to dropping this term if it becomes confusing, it just helped me conceptualize my use case.* \r\n\r\nAt first I tried overloading the int cast operator:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Expected types: string, int, DateTime\r\nobject[] Item = new object[] { \r\n    &quot;hello&quot;, new Contract&lt;int&gt;(), DateTime.Now()\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Contract&lt;T&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public static implicit operator int(Contract&lt;T&gt; Contract)\r\n    {\r\n        // Here the data would be actually resolved\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, in the client code (in a referenced assembly I have no control over) where `object[] Item` is used, I get the following error: ```expected System.Int32 but found Namespace.Contract `1[System.Int32]```. Apparently, the client code expects an Int32 value but receives an Int32 boxed inside a Contract, if I understand this error message (I might not).\r\n\r\nOne way I thought of trying to do this was:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Expected types: string, int, DateTime\r\nobject[] Item = new object[] { \r\n    &quot;hello&quot;, new Contract&lt;int&gt;(), DateTime.Now()\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Interface to allow creating a List of generics\r\npublic interface IContract {}\r\n\r\nList&lt;IContract&gt; Contracts = new List&lt;IContract&gt;();\r\n\r\npublic class Contract&lt;T&gt; : IContract\r\n{\r\n    public Contract()\r\n    {\r\n        Contracts.Add(this);\r\n    }    \r\n    \r\n    public static implicit operator int(Contract&lt;T&gt; Contract)\r\n    {\r\n        // Here the data would be actually resolved\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// And later on\r\nforeach (var Contract in Contracts)\r\n{\r\n    Contract = (int)(Contract&lt;int&gt;)Contract;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut for obvious reasons foreach iteration variables are immutable.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that when the client code comes to evaluate the contents of the array, it expects an integer but finds a boxed value. If it was dynamic, it would still encounter a Contract object rather than the int it expects. I overloaded the int cast operator in hopes that it would perform a cast to the type it expects, but it does not. I really need some way of either a) automatically unboxing the type when the client code evaluates it or b) manually unboxing the type myself just beforehand.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to proceed? I&#39;m open to changing to a different pattern entirely. The thought of initializing the object[] without the correct data in the first place seems misguided. If there is a better way to resolve the array data at the time the data becomes available, I&#39;m interested.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025268/how-can-i-create-an-object-which-acts-as-a-contract-for-data-e-g-an-integer","title":"How can I create an object which acts as a &quot;contract&quot;

all the code below can be put in a Playground to show that it works.)\r\n\r\nIn order to solve this, you have to manually write all your initializers.

So, I tried manually cloning the repository. Doing something like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nREPO=/tmp/path/to/repository\r\ngit clone https://github.com/myself/mycode.git $REPO\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this just checks out whatever is on the default branch. So, I investigated checking out `$GITHUB_SHA` which turns out to be something that is unknown to my repository. And the same is true for `$GITHUB_REF` which is just empty.\r\n\r\nAt this point I am clueless, about what I am doing. My initial assumption was that a job that is literally configured to run `on: [pull request]` should have exactly that code but it does not manage to checkout and prepare the it. \r\n\r\nI also investigated the provided [Checkout Actions](https://github.com/actions/checkout):\r\n\r\n&gt; This action checks out your repository to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`, so that your workflow can access the contents of your repository.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; By default, this is equivalent to running `git fetch` and `git checkout $GITHUB_SHA`, so that you&#39;ll always have your repo contents at the version that triggered the workflow.\r\nSee [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) to learn what `$GITHUB_SHA` is for different kinds of events.\r\n\r\nBut as I said before, the `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` is entirely empty, and a `git fetch` will just tell you that there is no git repository.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s such an [example failure](https://github.com/dothereum/dothereum/runs/228669159):\r\n\r\n```\r\nOn branch master\r\nYour branch is up to date with &#39;origin/master&#39;.\r\n\r\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\r\nfatal: reference is not a tree: d76745134ae45905e4a0ab8d27c92f1e2544bdc1\r\n##[error]Process completed with exit code 128.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is the `$GITHUB_SHA` if it&#39;s unknown to my repository?

I assume that you could fix it by initializing `s2`, but it&#39;s not possible to do before constructor call in initialization list.\r\n\r\nYou cannot change order of creation, even if you write that section in wrong order. `s2` always initialized after `s1`, both done after constructor call but before entering its body. Thus the order looks like:\r\n\r\n 1. Call of ctor `S(int)` with initialization of argument `i`;\r\n 2. Creation of lambda object, capturing `this` and `i`\r\n 3. Call of operator() of lambda\r\n 4. **Call `operator=` of `std::string` for object stored at location of `s2`**\r\n 5. Creation of `std::string`\r\n 6. Delegating call of ctor `S(std::string)` with argument `s`  with reference to created string.\r\n 7. Initialization of `s1` with value of `s`\r\n 8. **Default initialization of `s2`**\r\n\r\nBullets 4. and 8. happen in order which isn&#39;t legal, even worse, due to implementation, it may not to yield an error, so gcc version likely writes that data into some random area of memory. MSVC, at least in debug version, may generate some diagnostic code, for standard doesn&#39;t define program behavior for such case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025202/why-partially-initializing-a-class-and-then-invoking-delegating-ctor-fails/58025411#58025411","title":"Why partially initializing a class and then invoking delegating ctor fails?"}],"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":1832484,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13881b9ab67bb8b25111fed417a8015b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1832484","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832484/user1832484"},"last_editor":{"reputation":106,"user_id":1832484,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13881b9ab67bb8b25111fed417a8015b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1832484","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832484/user1832484"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58025291,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568972496,"creation_date":1568970265,"last_edit_date":1568972036,"question_id":58025202,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025202","body_markdown":"Following code does not initialize struct string members to same value.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    \r\n    struct S\r\n    {\r\n        std::string s1;\r\n        std::string s2;\r\n        S(std::string const&amp; s) : s1{s}{}\r\n        S(int i) : S([&amp;]{\r\n            s2 = std::to_string(i);\r\n            return std::to_string(i);\r\n        }())\r\n        {}\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        S s{123};\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; s.s1 &lt;&lt; &quot;|&quot; &lt;&lt; s.s2;\r\n    \r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting segmentation fault in gcc (tried different versions),\r\nand `123|` in clang (different versions also) through Wandbox.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting a read access violation Visual Studio 15.9.16\r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025202/why-partially-initializing-a-class-and-then-invoking-delegating-ctor-fails","title":"Why partially initializing a class and then invoking delegating ctor fails?"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","forms"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":445,"user_id":5809739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f32c739c1ddebf4a220a79bc1c48868?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Niklas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5809739/niklas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568970329,"post_id":58025195,"comment_id":102452742,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025195/activating-select-dropdown-menu-with-div-span-onclick#comment102452742_58025195"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568970520,"post_id":58025195,"comment_id":102452830,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025195/activating-select-dropdown-menu-with-div-span-onclick#comment102452830_58025195"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12046273,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tq8GjNX9sis/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rchGITBGXag1OyeBiJfwvAaZcRY5g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"W.

For example:\r\n\r\n````\r\nAutomationTestSuite.Tests.MyTestClass_1.MyTest\r\nAutomationTestSuite.Tests.MyTestClass_2.MyOtherTest\r\n\r\n````\r\nAfter you run the tests, the results will be saved in the `NUnit.ConsoleRunner &gt; tools` directory. The results are in XML format and can be programatically parsed to push your test results to another tool.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of arguments you can pass into the ConsoleRunner, including build configuration and framework version, all which are specified on NUnit&#39;s documentation.\r\n\r\nNUnit console runner also integrates with Cake, which is a build scripting tool for C# projects. So, you could hypothetically clean / build your project, restore missing package references, and run your tests, all from the console.\r\n\r\nMore info on NUnit console runner can be found here: https://github.com/nunit/docs/wiki/Console-Command-Line","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025192/run-selenium-test-case-from-a-console-application-c/58085187#58085187","title":"Run selenium test case from a console application c#"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12093961,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d9f37ab698f50090a27e053619fc5d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12093961","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093961/user12093961"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569344974,"creation_date":1568970218,"question_id":58025192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025192","body_markdown":"how to create a console app - a batch file which will hit my Automation testing application and runs selected test cases.

Let&#39;s say you want to have a upload location on S3 bucket. \r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;Version&quot;:&quot;2012-10-17&quot;,\r\n  &quot;Statement&quot;:[\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;Sid&quot;:&quot;Upload&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Effect&quot;:&quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Principal&quot;: &quot;*&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Action&quot;:[&quot;s3:PutObject&quot;],\r\n      &quot;Resource&quot;:[&quot;arn:aws:s3:::examplebucket/uploads/*&quot;]\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these cases you really don&#39;t want to default the Resource to the bucket as it could accidentally cause global access.  It is better to make sure the user clearly understands what access is being allowed or denied.\r\n\r\nBut why make it required for resource policies where it isn&#39;t need like SQS?  For this let&#39;s dive into how resource policies are used.\r\n\r\nYou can grant access to a resources 2 ways:\r\n\r\n 1. Identity based policies for IAM principals (users and roles).\r\n 2. Resource based policies\r\n\r\nThe important part to understand is how are resource polices used? Resource policies are actually used by IAM in the policy evaluation logic for authorization.  To put it another way, resources are not responsible for the actual authorization that is left to IAM (Identity and Access Management).\r\n\r\nSince IAM requires that every policy statement have a Resource or NotResource this means the service would need to add the resource when sending it to IAM if it was missing. So let us look at the implications from a design perspective of having the service add the resource if it is missing. \r\n\r\n 1. The service no longer would need to just verify the policy is correct.\r\n 2. If the resource is missing from the statement the service would need to update the policy before sending it to IAM.\r\n 3. There is now the potential for two different versions of a resource policy. The one the user created for editing and the one sent to IAM.\r\n 4. It increases the potential for user error and accidentally opening up access by attaching a policy to the wrong resource. If we modify the policy statement in the question drop the resource and condition statement we have a pretty open policy.  This could easily be attached to the wrong resource especially from the CLI or terraform.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n  {\r\n   &quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;example-statement-ID&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n   &quot;Principal&quot;: {\r\n     &quot;AWS&quot;: &quot;*&quot;  \r\n   },\r\n   &quot;Action&quot;: [\r\n    &quot;*&quot;\r\n   ]\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote I answered this from a general design perspective based on my understanding of how AWS implements access management.  How AWS implemented the system might be a little different but I doubt it because policy evaluation logic really needs to be optimized for performance so it&#39;s better do to that in in one service, IAM,  instead of in each service. \r\n\r\nHope that helps. \r\n\r\nExtra reading if you are interested in the details of the [Policy Evaluation Logic][1].\r\n\r\nYou can deny access 6 ways:\r\n\r\n 1. Identity Policy\r\n 2. Resource policies\r\n 3. Organizational Polices if your account is part of an organization\r\n 4. IAM permission boundaries if set\r\n 5. Session Assumed Policy if used\r\n 6. Implicitly if there was no allow policy\r\n\r\nHere is the complete IAM policy evaluation logic workflow.\r\n[![The complete IAM policy evaluation][2]][2] \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcRzv.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025174/what-is-the-purpose-of-resource-in-an-aws-resource-policy/58028903#58028903","title":"What is the purpose of &#39;resource&#39; in an AWS resource policy?"}],"owner":{"reputation":835,"user_id":6257027,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88909d07b44386f4023934312dfc76ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user113531","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6257027/user113531"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58028903,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568984432,"creation_date":1568970133,"question_id":58025174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025174","body_markdown":"As per title, what is the purpose of having the resource field when defining a resource policy when the resource policy is already going to be applied to a particular resource.\r\n\r\nFor example, in this aws [tutorial][1], the following policy is defined an attached to a queue.

trying to make a program where three levers control a security access system. The user is asked, for each lever, whether they pull the lever or not. In the end. if the second lever is pulled, the door will not open, but if either the first or third lever is pulled, then the door will open.\r\n\r\nThe caveat to this problem is that I&#39;m limited to only one if statement and one else statement. I&#39;ve racked my brains but cannot for the life of me think of a solution that encompasses all the situations with just two statements.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    door_one = str(input(&quot;Do you pull the first lever? &quot;))\r\n    door_two = str(input(&quot;Do you pull the second lever? &quot;))\r\n    door_three = str(input(&quot;Do you pull the third lever? &quot;))\r\n    if door_two == &quot;yes&quot;:\r\n        print(&quot;The door remains shut.&quot;)\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;The door opens!&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this code is incorrect but I can&#39;t think of how I can reduce the number of statements to satisfy the conditions above\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025168/how-do-i-create-a-system-with-limited-if-statements","title":"How do I create a system with limited if statements?"},{"tags":["react-native-navigation"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12094501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ba9TGmaOulI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdhayAfF1e3BBUnbOthjUvv-oXlwQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"jf_morales","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094501/jf-morales"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568972694,"creation_date":1568970117,"last_edit_date":1568972694,"question_id":58025167,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025167","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to react-native and I want to go to EditAccount from AccountScreen with a header button, but when I press it, it doesn&#39;t do anything.\r\n\r\nAny tips on how to make it work or what I&#39;m doing wrong?\r\n    \r\n    export default class AccountScreen extends React.Component {\r\n    \t\tstatic navigationOptions = ({navigation}) =&gt; {\r\n    \t\t\treturn {\r\n    \t\t\t\ttitle: &#39;Mi cuenta&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t\theaderStyle: {\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tbackgroundColor: &#39;#030303&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tborderBottomColor: &#39;#fff&#39;,\r\n    \t\t\t\t},\r\n    \t\t\t\theaderRight: (\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t&lt;Button onPress={() =&gt; navigation.navigate(&#39;EditAccount&#39;)}\r\n            \t\t\t\ttitle=&#39;Editar cuenta&#39;&gt;\r\n          \t\t\t\t&lt;/Button&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t),\r\n    \t\t\t\theaderTitleStyle:{ color: &#39;#fff&#39;}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t};\r\n    \r\n    \trender() {\r\n    \t\treturn (\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;View style={styles.contenedor}&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t\t&lt;Text style={styles.textos}&gt; Parrafo de prueba &lt;/Text&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t&lt;/View&gt;\r\n    \t\t\t);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025167/navigation-navigate-doesnt-work-on-header-button","title":"Navigation.navigate doesn&#39;t work on header button"},{"tags":["spring","thymeleaf"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":5670293,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gZPmA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5670293/david"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568974509,"creation_date":1568974509,"answer_id":58026364,"question_id":58025165,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58026364","body_markdown":"First of all your controller should contain get method which returns Student object as a form to bind.

transform(json)\r\n    res1: Either[io.circe.DecodingFailure,io.circe.Json] =\r\n    Right({\r\n      &quot;data&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;title&quot; : &quot;example input&quot;,\r\n        &quot;collection&quot; : [\r\n          6,\r\n          7,\r\n          8\r\n        ]\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;boolean&quot; : false,\r\n      &quot;collection&quot; : [\r\n        1,\r\n        2,\r\n        3\r\n      ]\r\n    })\r\n\r\nIf you look at it the right way, our `transform` method kind of resembles a decoder, and we can actually write it as one (although I&#39;d definitely recommend not making it implicit):\r\n\r\n    import io.circe.{Decoder, Json, JsonObject}\r\n    import io.circe.syntax._\r\n\r\n    val transformData: Decoder[Json] = { c =&gt;\r\n      val someBoolean = c.downField(&quot;data&quot;).downField(&quot;someBoolean&quot;)\r\n      val innerData = someBoolean.delete.downField(&quot;innerData&quot;)\r\n    \r\n      (\r\n        innerData.delete.up.as[JsonObject],\r\n        someBoolean.as[Json],\r\n        innerData.get[Json](&quot;innerCollection&quot;)\r\n      ).mapN(_.add(&quot;boolean&quot;, _).add(&quot;collection&quot;, _)).map(Json.fromJsonObject)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis can be convenient in some situations where you want to perform the transformation as part of a pipeline that expects a decoder: \r\n\r\n    scala&gt; io.circe.jawn.decode(myJsonString)(transformData)\r\n    res2: Either[io.circe.Error,io.circe.Json] =\r\n    Right({\r\n      &quot;data&quot; : {\r\n        &quot;title&quot; : &quot;example input&quot;,\r\n        &quot;collection&quot; : [ ...\r\n\r\nThis is also potentially confusing, though, and I&#39;ve thought about adding some kind of `Transformation` type to Circe that would encapsulate transformations like this without questionably repurposing the `Decoder` type class.\r\n\r\nOne nice thing about both the `transform` method and this decoder is that if the input data doesn&#39;t have the expected shape, the resulting error will include a history that points to the problem.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025149/transforming-json-with-circe/58025150#58025150","title":"Transforming JSON with Circe"}],"owner":{"reputation":122245,"user_id":334519,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf774a4e24c33e4bb6d19ea1939f01a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Travis Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/334519/travis-brown"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58025150,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568970056,"creation_date":1568970056,"question_id":58025149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025149","body_markdown":"Suppose I have some JSON data like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;title&quot;: &quot;example input&quot;,\r\n            &quot;someBoolean&quot;: false,\r\n            &quot;innerData&quot;:  {\r\n                &quot;innerString&quot;: &quot;input inner string&quot;,\r\n                &quot;innerBoolean&quot;: true,\r\n                &quot;innerCollection&quot;: [1,2,3,4,5]\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;collection&quot;: [6,7,8,9,0]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd I want to flatten it a bit and transform or remove some fields, to get the following result:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;ttl&quot;: &quot;example input&quot;,\r\n            &quot;bool&quot;: false,\r\n            &quot;collection&quot;: [6,7,8,9,0],\r\n            &quot;innerCollection&quot;: [1,2,3,4,5]\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow can I do this with [Circe](https://github.com/circe/circe)?\r\n\r\n(Note that I&#39;m asking this as a FAQ since similar questions often come up in the [Circe Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/circe/circe).

Any help would be much appreciated!\r\n\r\n    const fetch = require(&#39;node-fetch&#39;);\r\n    const dotenv = require(&#39;dotenv&#39;);\r\n    dotenv.config();\r\n    \r\n    function getCoordinates(address) {\r\n      let searchAddress = address.split(&quot; &quot;).join(&quot;+&quot;);\r\n      let url =\r\n        &quot;https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=&quot; +\r\n        searchAddress +\r\n        &quot;&amp;key=&quot; + process.env.GOOGLE_API;\r\n      return fetch(url)\r\n        .then(response =&gt; response.json())\r\n        .then(data =&gt; data.results[0].formatted_address)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    let a = getCoordinates(&quot;Buckingham Palace, London&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    console.log(a)\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a much simpler version without API calls if you wanna try it at home!\r\n\r\n    function getCoordinates() {\r\n      var promiseTest = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\r\n        if (1 + 1 === 2) {\r\n          resolve(&#39;pass&#39;)\r\n        } else {\r\n          reject(&#39;fail&#39;)\r\n        }\r\n      })\r\n      return promiseTest.then(data =&gt; data);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    console.log(getCoordinates())\r\n\r\nFurther EDIT:\r\n\r\nSo I think I&#39;m thinking about Promises &amp; Asynchronicity wrong.  I need to do a little reading up about then.  I&#39;m going to stay away from using async functions and just extend my promises to include the callbacks. But thanks all for the help!

These bugs mostly do occur after you changed a CDS source/definition. Here a few of them:\r\n\r\n - Open transaction `segw` and **refresh the entity structure** by right clicking &quot;refresh all&quot;. \r\n\r\n [![in edit mode][1]][1]. \r\n\r\n -  Afterwards click on the **red white beachball** to regenerate the MPC/DPC classes.\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n - What the red white beachball actually does is kind of merging a the changed structure with the existing classes. Right click on the project and choose **&quot;Generate runtime&quot;** to really re-generate all of the runtime objects.\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n - Sometimes there&#39;s a **clean up button** in the entities overview. Click it.\r\n\r\n - In transaction `/iwfnd/gw_client` choose Metadata→**Cleanup Cache**→On both systems\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\n - Cleaning the cache works quite well for OData views that have been manually created from ABAP types in `segw` but Core Data Services might still be cached. In case none of the above helped:\r\n  - logout and login again\r\n  - restart the transaction\r\n  - wait for an hour or two\r\n\r\n - Try to **manually test the failing OData request** directly in `/iwfnd/gw_client`. You can activate logging in `/iwfnd/traces` to double check what the requests from your client actually look like. \r\n\r\n - Check your OData client. Does it maybe internally cache the `$metadata`?\r\n\r\n - Check that the transport request was successfully processed, using e.g. transaction `se10`. Transports/**Imports to another system might be blocked by long running SADL queries**.

Use the following code.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;  \r\n&lt;LinearLayout xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;  \r\n   android:orientation=&quot;vertical&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;  \r\n   android:background=&quot;#6BC6ED&quot;  \r\n&gt;  \r\n&lt;TextView  \r\n   android:id=&quot;@+id/Name&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;   \r\n   android:textSize=&quot;25dp&quot;  \r\n   android:textColor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot;  \r\n/&gt;  \r\n&lt;ListView  \r\n   android:id=&quot;@+id/demolist&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;  \r\n   android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;&gt;   \r\n&lt;/ListView&gt;  \r\n&lt;/LinearLayout&gt;  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilar to what we did in Forms , create new model class which contains the binding property in ViewCell. \r\n\r\nFor example\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Students {  \r\n    public string Name {  \r\n        get;  \r\n        set;  \r\n    }  \r\n    public int Age {  \r\n        get;  \r\n        set;  \r\n    }  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, you need to create Adapter to bind the data to the ListView. Android has in-built base adapter class for Adapter implementations to bind a ListView to a data source. Also, we can get item position, count, and selected item, etc. there. Count method is used to get the number of rows in the list.\r\n\r\nGetView method is used to return a View for each row, populated with which element.\r\n\r\nGetItemId method is used to return row data properties like row number and value.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class StudentAdapter: BaseAdapter &lt;

 \r\n}  \r\n```\r\n\r\nTo handle the selected items, write the below code.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void StudentlistView_ItemClick(object sender, AdapterView.ItemClickEventArgs e) {  \r\n    var select = mlist[e.Position].Name;  \r\n    Android.Widget.Toast.MakeText(this, select, Android.Widget.ToastLength.Long).Show();  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details you can check [here][1] .\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/how-to-use-list-view-and-adapter-in-xamarin-android-application/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025131/xamarin-android-how-can-i-set-the-textcell-property-of-a-listview/58026746#58026746","title":"&quot;Xamarin Android&quot;

Thus, no need escaping it here.\r\nAlso, since you used `+` as a delimiter, there is no point escaping `/` chars any longer, replace `\\/` with `/`.\r\n\r\nUse\r\n\r\n    sed &#39;s+&gt;\\{1,2\\}[[:space:]]*/dev/null[[:space:]]*2&gt;&amp;1++g&#39; install.sh &gt; install_debug.sh\r\n\r\nIn a GNU `sed` you may surely use `\\s` to shorten the pattern:\r\n\r\n    sed -E &#39;s+&gt;{1,2}\\s*/dev/null\\s*2&gt;&amp;1++g&#39; install.sh &gt; install_debug.sh\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the [online `sed` demo][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ideone.com/sLDjA9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025114/replacing-error-redirection-to-null-device-in-bash-script-and-create-a-new-file/58025308#58025308","title":"Replacing error redirection to null device in Bash script and create a new file"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1485,"user_id":8382929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/feb63c4676da4621466f8c12e590b644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bayou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8382929/bayou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568970817,"post_id":58025312,"comment_id":102453005,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025114/replacing-error-redirection-to-null-device-in-bash-script-and-create-a-new-file/58025312#comment102453005_58025312"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1485,"user_id":8382929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/feb63c4676da4621466f8c12e590b644?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bayou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8382929/bayou"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568970669,"creation_date":1568970669,"answer_id":58025312,"question_id":58025114,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58025312","body_markdown":"You have to escape the `{`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ sed &#39;s#&gt;\\{1,2\\}\\s*/dev/null\\s*2&gt;\\&amp;1##g&#39; install.txt\r\n  elif type lsb_release ; then\r\n    if lsof /var/lib/dpkg/lock ; then\r\n      sudo apt-get update  &amp;&amp; \\\r\n      sudo DEBIAN_FRONTEND=falseninteractive apt-get install -y sshpass python-minimal python-pip dbus  &amp;&amp; \\\r\n      sudo apt-get install -y jq \r\n      sudo python_for_core_os \r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58025114/replacing-error-redirection-to-null-device-in-bash-script-and-create-a-new-file/58025312#58025312","title":"Replacing error redirection to null device in Bash script and create a new file"}],"owner":{"reputation":294,"user_id":1710131,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sS9xj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kobbi Gal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1710131/kobbi-gal"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58025308,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568975384,"creation_date":1568969921,"question_id":58025114,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58025114","body_markdown":"I am attempting to create a new debug installation script from an existing one.

They only exist for the duration of a single connection. Those that have a single `#` prefix are only visible to the connection that created them. \r\n\r\nThe error `invalid table name #Temp_trans_13` can only be raised when *another* query tries to use that table and can&#39;t find it, either because it wasn&#39;t created yet or because it was created in a different connection.\r\n\r\nTo use a temp table from another connection one needs to create a [global temporary table](https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/4031/sql-server-global-temporary-table-visibility/) by using `##` as a prefix.
