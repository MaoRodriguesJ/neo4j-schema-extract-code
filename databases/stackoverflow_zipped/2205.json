There is no event, as such, in the Word object model to inform when file locks have been released.  (I find it odd, however, that this would apply to image files, normally, I only associate this problem with Word files and linked content.)\r\n\r\nOne very important thing is that the code release the COM objects explicitly and run GC. If this doesn&#39;t happen, the file locks won&#39;t be released before the calling application goes out of scope (quits and cleans up), if then. The code in the question appears to release the objects, but it doesn&#39;t garbage collect. For an example, see [this answer][1].\r\n\r\nVery often, the strategy for this problem is to check for these files the next time the application runs and delete them then.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility would be to check for the presence of the related &quot;temp&quot; file Word opens when a document is opened. This will be in the same folder as the document and the file name starts with a tilde (`~`). When that disappears from the folder, the file lock should be gone.

Since I have to insert a couple of images, I create a copy of them in the temp folder of the computer(from a database request) and want to delete all of those files when closing the app.\r\n\r\nIt seems like closing the actual document and ApplicationClass of Office.Interop.Word takes some time, and I would like to know if there&#39;s a way to trigger an event or anything similar when the application is actually closed.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my function :\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void CloseDocument()\r\n{\r\n    if (_doc != null)\r\n    {\r\n        _doc.Close();\r\n        _doc = null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (_appClass != null)\r\n    {\r\n        _appClass.Quit();\r\n        _appClass = null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    File.Delete(tempFileName);\r\n\r\n    foreach (string path in _imagePaths)\r\n    {\r\n        File.Delete(path);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis function is binded to the ``OnHandleDestroyed`` Event. Unfortunately, when the document contains a bunch of images, it seems like it takes some times for the ```_doc``` and ```_appClass``` objects to actually close, leading the program to throw a ```System.IO.IOException``` : ```The process cannot access the file &#39;C:\\Users\\***\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\alr1snsc.png&#39; because it is being used by another process.``` \r\n\r\nIs there any way to actually trigger a function when the document or ApplicationClass is properly close ? Note that if I insert a sleep before trying to delete the files, everything works fine, this is why I came to the conclusion that it&#39;s really about properly closing the document.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58016005/word-interop-document-takes-time-to-close-not-able-to-delete-temporary-files","title":"Word interop Document takes time to close, not able to delete temporary files"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d","state","state-machine","fsm"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12091606,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBunry83TImsidiiN8gXGkIF0uhtweXZbhkx_Cqpw=k-s128","display_name":"Usama Arshad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091606/usama-arshad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568986006,"post_id":58019019,"comment_id":102460949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58016003/universal-fsm-in-c-to-implement-any-state-machine-and-to-check-any-next-state/58019019#comment102460949_58019019"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18576,"user_id":22437,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H4s3Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dour High Arch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/22437/dour-high-arch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18576,"user_id":22437,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H4s3Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dour High Arch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/22437/dour-high-arch"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568929281,"last_edit_date":1568929281,"creation_date":1568927736,"answer_id":58019019,"question_id":58016003,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58019019","body_markdown":"The simplest FSM implements a `State Next(Event e)` method, and yours doesn&#39;t do that.

Another answer, [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54482204), suggests the following.\r\n\r\n1. Manually modify the `sdkmanager` script\r\n2.

user heap allocation of a type `T` is not actually a thing you can do in C++. At least, not so long as they can create `T`s. Even if you manage to forbid `make_shared&lt;T&gt;`, your user can still do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nunique_ptr opt = new optional&lt;T&gt;;\r\nopt-&gt;emplace(...);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `T` inside of `*opt` is definitely on the heap. Any number of other similar gymnastics can achieve the same effect. You can even call `make_shared&lt;optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;`, with the `in_place` parameters.\r\n\r\nSo long as `T` has publicly accessible constructors, or there is any publicly accessible way of constructing a `T` that returns a prvalue of it, users can find ways to store that `T` on the heap.\r\n\r\nSo the only way to prevent this is to make all of your constructors private (whether directly with `private` or a `private` key type or whatever other mechanism you want) and only provide publicly accessible functions that return `shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;`s.\r\n\r\nOutside of macros, there is no C++ mechanism that just causes a type to work this way. It must be done individually, for each type that you want to work this way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015983/how-to-block-usage-of-stdmake-sharedt/58017884#58017884","title":"how to block usage of std::make_shared&lt;T&gt;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7466467,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/136bfb5f0fb422db949100d8c3f7cff3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arlak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7466467/arlak"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568987922,"creation_date":1568987922,"answer_id":58029835,"question_id":58015983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58029835","body_markdown":"Above answers are better solutions to the problem.

Apparently, simply making the `operator new` private in a class does not stop it.\r\n\r\nNote that I do not want to completely prevent shared pointers from being created by any means, as I intend to still be able to produce a `std::shared_ptr` for my custom class by calling a static generator method, but I still want to prevent others from trying to call `std::make_shared` on my class directly.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nTo address queries below, my ultimate goal here is a flexible and reusable mechanism for extracting a shared_ptr from a raw pointer. `std::enable_shared_from_this` is regretfully not very friendly when it comes to inheritance and especially multiple inheritance. \r\n\r\nAlso, because I am intending for this to be used as in a template class using [CRTP][1], it would complicate matters somewhat for the a child class T to need to explicitly make the templated parent class it inherits from a friend so that it can access otherwise private

You can use some built in [.net core tag helpers][1] to specify what method you want to call once the form gets submitted. Make sure your button has the ```type=&quot;submit&quot;```. That tells the form that whenever it&#39;s clicked, go ahead and make a post request to that handler. \r\n\r\n    &lt;form asp-page-handler=&quot;SendPhoneVerificationCode&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;

(I don&#39;t know if installing these packages will automatically enable them, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised either way. If however they are not enabled by default, you would have to write a script that does enable them... but I&#39;m quite confident, you can find tutorials or something). Compiled libraries are way smaller than the libraries plus their source code (and the source code of compiled in dependencies).\r\n\r\nsince I don&#39;t know your exact project, maybe it does need to compile all that for whatever reason, maybe it&#39;s to get the last percent (or twenty...) of performance, so all lines in that script might have a very good reason. \r\n\r\nSo in the end, it comes down to trial and error. \r\n\r\nto answer your questions:\r\n\r\n&gt; * Is there any slimmer solution to this?\r\n\r\nmost likely, using pre-compiled stuff\r\n\r\n&gt; * Can I delete something that is needed only at build time?\r\n\r\nmost likely, you theoretically only need the compiled libraries\r\n\r\n&gt; * Can I replace these with something smaller?\r\n\r\nsee above, but might have unforeseen consequences. if you care about performance, benchmark performance with the original and the pre-compiled version. for checking correctness (if you doubt that) send all requests to both the original and the pre-compiled version and check identity of output.\r\n\r\n&gt; * Do I really need a 500M package (libghc-zlib-dev) to read .xlsx files with phpoffice/phpspreadsheet?\r\n\r\nprobably not\r\n\r\nOverall: using pre-compiled libraries can have a (negative) performance impact, you might have stuff compiled in, that you don&#39;t need. However, I would not expect the performance gains worth the time and just use pre-compiled libraries. (On top: you might also choose a different docker image - maybe even an alpine one -, which doesn&#39;t need any compilation at all and already has most stuff pre-installed and might still be smaller - looking at the *assumed* source dockerfile you extend, the libraries you add may already been compiled in and you&#39;re just recompiling them ...)\r\n\r\nThis is obviously an opinionated answer. There are certainly those who like to compile stuff themselves and there absolutely might be very good reasons to do so.

This is not allowed.  Try this version instead.\r\n\r\n    export function retrieveTeam() {\r\n        return async (dispatch: Dispatch) =&gt; {\r\n    \r\n            const team = await getTeam_firestore();\r\n            const mappedTeam: User[] = await Promise.all(team.map(\r\n                async (val: User, index: number) =&gt; {\r\n                  const result = {...val};\r\n                  if (result.photoURL !== null) {\r\n                    const response = await fetch(result.photoURL);\r\n                    const blob = await response.blob();\r\n                    result.photoURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\r\n                  }\r\n                  return result;\r\n            }));\r\n    \r\n            console.log(&#39;Got team&#39;)\r\n    \r\n            return dispatch({\r\n                type: &#39;TEAM_RECIEVED&#39;,\r\n                payload: mappedTeam\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis version awaits the async fetching before dispatching the TEAM_RECIEVED action.\r\n\r\nA bit more explanation:\r\n\r\narray.foreach(async function) will just queue a bunch of async work but foreach will return immediately.  You need to await all of the async work.  So you cant use array.foreach().  The solution is one of these 2 patterns:\r\n\r\nAssume you have this method:\r\n\r\n    async function getValWithPhoto(val) {\r\n      const result = {...val};\r\n      if (result.photoURL !== null) {\r\n         const response = await fetch(result.photoURL);\r\n         const blob = await response.blob();\r\n         result.photoURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);\r\n      }\r\n      return result;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPattern 1 - run each async fetch in serial order (one at a time):\r\n----\r\n\r\n    const mappedTeam = [];\r\n    for (const val of team) {\r\n      const mappedVal = await getValWithPhoto(val);\r\n      mappedTeam.push(mappedVal);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    return dispatch(...);\r\n\r\nPattern 2 - run all the fetch jobs in parallel (at the same time) (what I did in my answer above):\r\n----\r\n\r\n    const arrayOfPromises = team.map(val =&gt; getValWithPhoto(val));\r\n    // Use Promise.all() to turn the array of promises into a single\r\n    // promise: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all\r\n    const promise = Promise.all(arrayOfPromises);\r\n    // now await that promise, which will return array of results\r\n    const mappedTeam = await promise;\r\n    return dispatch(...);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015922/react-wont-rerender-when-redux-state-changes/58016273#58016273","title":"React won&#39;t rerender when Redux state changes"}],"owner":{"reputation":161,"user_id":10031533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6JW3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian Pascu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10031533/adrian-pascu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":161,"user_id":10031533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/I6JW3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian Pascu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10031533/adrian-pascu"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58016273,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568916664,"creation_date":1568912902,"last_edit_date":1568913974,"question_id":58015922,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015922","body_markdown":"Within a react app I have a mapping of some data fetched from a Redux store to some component\r\n\r\n    {this.props.team &amp;&amp; this.props.team.map((value: User, index: number) =&gt;\r\n                                        (&lt;Card key={index} className=&quot;team-card&quot;&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;CardMedia style={{\r\n                                                backgroundImage: `url(${value.photoURL})`\r\n                                            }} /&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Typography use={&quot;headline4&quot;}&gt;{value.displayName}&lt;/Typography&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;Typography use={&quot;body1&quot;}&gt;{value.description}&lt;/Typography&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;CardActions&gt;\r\n                                                &lt;CardActionButtons&gt;\r\n                                                    {/* TODO: Add the ability to go to About to a specific team member card */}\r\n                                                    &lt;CardActionButton&gt;Vezi profilul&lt;/CardActionButton&gt;\r\n                                                &lt;/CardActionButtons&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;/CardActions&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;/Card&gt;)\r\n                                    )}\r\n\r\nHere `team` is a prop mapped from a redux Store. The data in the Redux store gets fetched from the database when the user opens the App. This works, since I&#39;ve logged the changes of the `team` prop and it actually updates as expected. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that even after the prop gets updated,which happens maybe a second after the initial render, the app won&#39;t re-render to reflect this prop change. But if after that this component get&#39;s unmounted and remounted it gets rendered correctly. Also between the unmounting and remounting the redux store doesn&#39;t get updated and nothing happens in the mounting lifecycle.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea what may cause this behavior?

Generally, it will only do so when performing certain operations. For example, in the `FileSystemCache`, if you look at the [source code for the `get()` function][1] you can see that if you try to get a cached item that has expired, it deletes the file and returns `None`.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking at the [source code for the `set()` function][3], you can see the call to `_prune()` ([source code][2]). This is an internal function which (**if the number of cached files exceeds the threshold set in the constructor**) will go through the files in the cache directory and delete the expired files.\r\n\r\nThe reasons you are not seeing any files be deleted may be because even if the timeout is low, the threshold may be high enough that you aren&#39;t caching enough files for it to start deleting some. You can use the [`CACHE_THRESHOLD` config variable][4] to set the maximum number of files that can be cached.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/blob/4de05c6a36ffd00def34bd249e1fb6bdcc490bb8/flask_caching/backends/filesystem.py#L140-L151\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/blob/4de05c6a36ffd00def34bd249e1fb6bdcc490bb8/flask_caching/backends/filesystem.py#L105-L122\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/sh4nks/flask-caching/blob/4de05c6a36ffd00def34bd249e1fb6bdcc490bb8/flask_caching/backends/filesystem.py#L159-L185\r\n  [4]: https://flask-caching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#configuring-flask-caching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015920/flask-caching-filesystemcache-method-does-not-delete-cache-items-upon-timeout/58029525#58029525","title":"Flask-Caching FileSystemCache method does not delete cache items upon timeout"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11256657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac215897e079804aa36715e6069bd115?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sprmap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11256657/sprmap"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58029525,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568986735,"creation_date":1568912895,"question_id":58015920,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015920","body_markdown":"I have a Flask app, and I have implemented the &quot;Flask-Caching&quot; extension. I am using the &quot;FileSystemCache&quot; method. This is all new to me so it may be working properly and I&#39;m unaware.\r\n\r\nI have found that when I call cache.clear(), I will see items delete from the directory specified as my cache location. However, when I set the timeout to be something really short, I do not see the files delete when the timeout duration is reached.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if it is supposed to delete or if I should write a background task to delete all files older than the timeout setting. Each file is small but they accumulate very quickly. \r\n\r\nI ask that someone advise me if this is working as intended. Creating a background task to clear the directory is no issue but it seems like this should be happening automatically. \r\n\r\nIn terms of relevant code, there isn&#39;t much:\r\n\r\n    cache = Cache(app,config={&#39;CACHE_TYPE&#39;: &#39;filesystem&#39;, \r\n                          &#39;CACHE_DIR&#39;: r&quot;&lt;my cache directory&gt;&quot;, \r\n                          &#39;CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT&#39;: 15})\r\n\r\nThe timeout is only 15 seconds to aid my testing here but it will be increased later.

All went good:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts testing -m ping -u administrator\r\nnap-02.vm | SUCCESS =&gt; {\r\n    &quot;changed&quot;: false,\r\n    &quot;ping&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;\r\n}\r\nnap-01.vm | SUCCESS =&gt; {\r\n    &quot;changed&quot;: false,\r\n    &quot;ping&quot;: &quot;pong&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI have several users in the testing servers, so I&#39;m using the administrator user account.\r\n\r\nNext, I tried to do the same action (ping) using a playbook:\r\n```\r\n$ cat test.yml\r\n---\r\n- name: &quot;Get ping response&quot;\r\n  hosts: testing\r\n  tasks:\r\n  - action: ping\r\n    register: hello\r\n  - debug: msg=&quot;{hello.stdout}&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nBut after running it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ansible-playbook test.yml\r\n\r\n```\r\nI get the following output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPLAY [Get ping response] *******************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\n\r\nTASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nfatal: [nap-01.vm]: UNREACHABLE! =&gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;Failed to connect to the host via ssh: oscar@nap-01.vm: Permission denied (publickey,password).&quot;, &quot;unreachable&quot;: true}\r\nfatal: [nap-02.vm]: UNREACHABLE! =&gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;Failed to connect to the host via ssh: oscar@nap-02.vm: Permission denied (publickey,password).&quot;, &quot;unreachable&quot;: true}\r\n\r\nPLAY RECAP *********************************************************************************************************************************************************************************\r\nnap-01.vm                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0\r\nnap-02.vm                  : ok=0    changed=0    unreachable=1    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0\r\n\r\n````\r\nSo it seems like the remote is not allowing to connect via SSH and the permission is being denied. However, since ping worked via the module, I&#39;m guessing perhaps I&#39;m missing something at YAML file that indicates to connect to the &quot;administrator&quot; user like in the first test.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny advice on this issue would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015903/problem-with-ansible-notebook-to-ping-users","title":"Problem with Ansible Notebook to ping users"},{"tags":["python","linux","firefox","raspberry-pi","chromium"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12091601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKRX051OZjw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/RA1x1iTpb3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Xavier Camden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091601/xavier-camden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568915059,"post_id":58016150,"comment_id":102436504,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015901/how-do-i-open-different-types-of-web-browsers-through-python/58016150#comment102436504_58016150"},{"owner":{"reputation":2650,"user_id":11703358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5pIOl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ipaleka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11703358/ipaleka"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12091601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKRX051OZjw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/RA1x1iTpb3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Xavier Camden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091601/xavier-camden"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568915450,"post_id":58016150,"comment_id":102436656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015901/how-do-i-open-different-types-of-web-browsers-through-python/58016150#comment102436656_58016150"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2650,"user_id":11703358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5pIOl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ipaleka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11703358/ipaleka"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568913864,"creation_date":1568913864,"answer_id":58016150,"question_id":58015901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58016150","body_markdown":"\r\n    webbrowser.get(&quot;firefox&quot;).open(myurl)\r\n    #\r\n    webbrowser.get(&quot;opera&quot;).open(myurl)\r\n\r\nYou can find the list here: https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/webbrowser.html#webbrowser.register","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015901/how-do-i-open-different-types-of-web-browsers-through-python/58016150#58016150","title":"How do I open different types of web browsers through Python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12091601,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-AKRX051OZjw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACs/RA1x1iTpb3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Xavier Camden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12091601/xavier-camden"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568913864,"creation_date":1568912772,"question_id":58015901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015901","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to run a script on my Raspberry-Pi through Python that opens a specific search on Chromium, then switches over to Firefox and does another search.

You could use Cognito Identity Pool on the &quot;Master&quot; to generate temporary AWS Credentials, which can be used by the &quot;Regional&quot; account to make Cognito User Pool API calls. It is not advisable to implement such a lateral system for a production application, as it has its own share of pitfalls. Amazon Cognito does not offer any API or feature to back-up a User Pool either. \r\n\r\nIf you do decide to implement the recursive approach, I would recommend starting out by thoroughly understanding the difference between User Pools and Identity Pools. I had written an [article](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/cognito-user-pools-identity-pools/) for the same which elucidates upon the difference. You can then use your Identity Pool and RBAC to indirectly utilize another User Pool. \r\n\r\nAnother lateral way I can think of is via AWS Lambda, and securely loading credentials for the &quot;master&quot; account while using a managed AWS security service like AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store. \r\n\r\nEither way, to conclude, there is no straight-forward way to get this use-case working, and a lateral work-around/hack is the only way to go about it.

specific issue was being caused by the combination of the remote server dropping the TCP connection and the SSH2 library only raising an &#39;end&#39; event with no &#39;error&#39; event. This has been flagged as a bug in ssh2 and is listed in the issues for that module. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, a work-around has been added to ssh2-sftp-client. Essentially, an additional &#39;end&#39; listener has been added during the connection stage which will result in the connect promise being rejected if there is an end event raised. A new version of the package (v4.2.0) has been released which includes this fix. \r\n\r\nFor background information - part of the reason it is difficult to get consistent results when tracking down this issue is partly due to the MaxStartups setting of many SFTP servers (like openSSH). This setting can be a tuple of the form max:drop:full where max is the maximum allowed unauthenticated connections (connections which have not yet completed the handshake and authentication process), drop - percentage of connections to begin dropping after max is reached and full = number of unauthenticated connections to start dropping all connection attempts. The default value is often 10:30:60, which means allow 10 unauthenticated connections, start dropping 30% of them once there are more than 10 and drop all attempts once 60 unauthenticated connections occur. The drop value means that once more than 10 unauthenticated connections exist, attempts will be droped 30% of the time, which creates a somewhat random result in that each time you run your tests, different connections may be dropped. Servers will often just drop the connection without providing any additional information - you may or may not get a reset by peer error, depending on how the server does the dropping (often, you just get the end event and nothing more - no error raised).

I&#39;m currently working on a query where I have a list of patients at a medical facility who have certain diagnosis codes. It&#39;s a pretty basic query:\r\n\r\n    SELECT [several patient demographic fields]\r\n    FROM Diagnosis\r\n    WHERE DiagnosisCode IN (a bunch of diagnosis codes)\r\n\r\nThe query itself works fine, but there are a number of patients who have multiple codes from the WHERE clause attached to their chart, and each code ends up on a new row, so I get multiple results for each patient, with the code as the only difference, like so:\r\n\r\n    PatientID    Name             DiagnosisCode\r\n    ------------------------------------------------\r\n    1001         John Smith       123.0\r\n    1001         John Smith       ABC.0\r\n    1002         Jane Doe         456.1\r\n    1003         Bob Brown        789.0\r\n    1003         Bob Brown        DEF.1\r\n    1003         Bob Brown        XYZ.0\r\n\r\nI can work with this easily enough, but I wanted to know if there was any possible way to code this query so that a new column was created for every individual record for a given patient, thus displaying the results like this:\r\n\r\n    PatientID    Name             DxCode1     DxCode2     DxCode3\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    1001         John Smith       123.0       ABC.0\r\n    1002         Jane Doe         456.1\r\n    1003         Bob Brown        789.0       DEF.1       XYZ.0\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I have no way of knowing initially how many results a given patient is going to have. It *looks* like the majority of people only have 2 or 3, but in theory, a patient could have every diagnosis code included in my WHERE clause. In that case, that would be a LOT of added columns, but I would need SQL Server to just look at how many results there were for that patient and add those columns accordingly, if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is more of a curiosity question than a I-need-this-answered-in-order-to-even-do-my-work question. Would something like this even be possible?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015862/sql-create-new-columns-for-records-with-multiple-results","title":"SQL: Create new columns for records

am trying to write a function that will generate multiple histograms (one for each level of a factor) using ggplot.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the data set that I am using, I created a matrix of plots using `facet_wrap`, but I have 15 levels for my factor, and the counts for each level vary greatly for each bin, so the matrix of histograms wasn&#39;t very useful because I am forced to view each histogram on the same scale (e.g., one level had a max count of ~4,000, while another level only had a max count ~100).\r\n\r\nBelow is what I am trying to accomplish using the `iris` dataset as an example.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata(iris)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\n\r\nhisto_func = function(df){\r\n  species_list = unique(df$Species) #create a vector of levels for Species\r\n  for (i in

= histo_func(df = iris)\r\n\r\n species_hist\r\nNULL\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter running the function, I call `species_hist` and get NULL.\r\n\r\nThe function itself works - if I step through using `debugonce()`, I can call `species_plot` and get the histogram for whichever `i` the loop has cycled through at that point.\r\n\r\nWhat I want (if possible) is to store the histograms in `species_hist` and be able to output all the histograms in succession upon calling `species_hist`.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any input.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015853/is-it-possible-to-write-a-function-that-will-generate-multiple-graphs-using-ggpl","title":"Is it possible to write a function that will

I&#39;ve checked all the obvious access rights, I&#39;ve even used a DLL browser to check that their DLL contains the appropriate function export (the DLL browser has no problem accessing the DLL) !!\r\n\r\nI built a standalone test app for this customer, code below:\r\n\r\n```delphi\r\nfunction TForm40.PingDiagnose(InetAddress: string): boolean;\r\nvar\r\n  IPAddress: string;\r\n  Handle: THandle;\r\n  InAddr: IPAddr;\r\n  DW: DWORD;\r\n  rep: array [1 .. 1280] of byte;//try a stupid size in case that&#39;s the problem\r\nbegin\r\n  result := false;\r\n  Memo1.lines.add(&#39;Attempting to get handle on icmp.dll&#39;);\r\n  Handle := IcmpCreateFile;\r\n  if Handle = INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE then\r\n  begin\r\n    Memo1.lines.add(&#39;Failed to get handle on icmp.dll&#39;);\r\n    Exit;\r\n  end;\r\n  try\r\n    IPAddress := &#39;&#39;;\r\n    Memo1.lines.add(format(&#39;Attempting to resolve IP address for %s&#39;,[InetAddress]));\r\n    IPAddress := GetIPAddress(InetAddress);\r\n    Memo1.lines.add(format(&#39;IP address returned %s&#39;,[IPAddress]));\r\n    if (IPAddress &lt;&gt; &#39;&#39;) then  // if internet is down, IPAddress could be an empty string\r\n    begin\r\n      with TIdStackWindows.create do\r\n      begin\r\n        TranslateStringToTInAddr(IPAddress, InAddr, Id_IPv4);\r\n        free;\r\n      end;\r\n      Memo1.lines.add(&#39;Attempting to call IcmpSendEcho on icmp.dll&#39;);\r\n      DW := IcmpSendEcho(Handle, InAddr, nil, 0, nil, @rep, 1280, 1000);\r\n      Memo1.lines.add(format(&#39;Result returned from call: %d&#39;,[DW]));\r\n      if DW=0 then\r\n      begin\r\n        Memo1.lines.add(format(&#39;Error number: %d - %s&#39;,[GetLastError, SysErrorMessage(GetLastError)]));\r\n      end;\r\n      result := (DW &lt;&gt; 0);\r\n    end;\r\n  finally\r\n    IcmpCloseHandle(Handle);\r\n  end;\r\nend;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my assumption is that it&#39;s what `IcmpSendEcho()` does next that&#39;s causing the error. \r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find anything useful via Google, so any ideas on either what might be happening or how I can &quot;debug&quot; this further?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015836/how-to-diagnose-an-access-denied-error-from-windows-icmp-dll","title":"How to diagnose an Access Denied error from Windows ICMP.DLL"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core","entity-framework-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7323,"user_id":2089286,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2147959f9f9ce1bdd2453be92b27c3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brad M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089286/brad-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568913232,"post_id":58015833,"comment_id":102435717,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015833/how-can-i-detach-an-entity-from-data-graph-using-entity-framework-core#comment102435717_58015833"},{"owner":{"reputation":2384,"user_id":1076993,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hgolH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FatAlbert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1076993/fatalbert"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7323,"user_id":2089286,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2147959f9f9ce1bdd2453be92b27c3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brad M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089286/brad-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568968069,"post_id":58015833,"comment_id":102451679,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015833/how-can-i-detach-an-entity-from-data-graph-using-entity-framework-core#comment102451679_58015833"},{"owner":{"reputation":7323,"user_id":2089286,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2147959f9f9ce1bdd2453be92b27c3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brad M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2089286/brad-m"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568980459,"post_id":58015833,"comment_id":102457973,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015833/how-can-i-detach-an-entity-from-data-graph-using-entity-framework-core#comment102457973_58015833"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":1336651,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be0d0c809ef310cecab72cea5fb3160e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ivan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1336651/ivan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568999499,"creation_date":1568999499,"answer_id":58032633,"question_id":58015833,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58032633","body_markdown":"If you want to update only `VehicleDataEntity` properties, you can set `VehicleDataEntity.Type` property to `null`.

I want to update `Vehicle` using Entity Framework but I don&#39;t want to update `TypeId` (or `Type`). \r\n\r\nThe problem is that Entity Framework wants to update the whole graph and the result is that the properties of the `Type` entity is overwritten with empty values when updating `Vehicle`. \r\n\r\nI guess I could fetch the `Type` entity from the data source before updating, but it seems unnecessary to make two extra calls (read and save) to the database to update an entity not needed to be updated. \r\n\r\nI would  much rather detach the `Vehicle` entity from the graph and only update only this entity.

Don&#39;t use response from POST, but rather wait for &quot;user:created&quot; event that would updated list for all subscribed clients (including one that initiated POST) - **suggested approach**\r\n 2. Use your current implementation but your POST and &quot;user:created&quot; event should share some kind of identifier that they return along with rest of the request which client can use to determine whether he already got that information or not - e.g. &quot;user:created:{userId}&quot;. Then only client that don&#39;t have &quot;user:created:{userId}&quot; in memory would use WS event data. - not recommended\r\n 3. Skip WS event for user that initiated POST - problem with this is if specific user has multiple clients (tabs, browser + mobile, etc) connected - with this approach you&#39;d have to skip the WS event for the client (connectionId in socket terms) that initiated POST request (not user!). So if user has 10 connections, you&#39;d send &quot;user:created&quot; event to 9 connections except the one that initiated request + all other connections that should receive that event - not recommended since it complicates your backend a lot.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion easiest and cleanest way is to just ignore POST response and wait for that WS event - since those are sockets you shouldn&#39;t have any UI problems or delays.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015819/how-to-ignore-the-websocket-event-for-the-client-who-made-a-change-via-http/58077729#58077729","title":"How to ignore the websocket event for the client who made a change via HTTP?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":813,"user_id":5819709,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/520d05e7e9cf0e3974016340f5fc11bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Aman Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5819709/aman-gupta"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569403059,"creation_date":1569403059,"answer_id":58095113,"question_id":58015819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58095113","body_markdown":"If the client which has added a user emits the event, then use \r\n\r\n    // sending to all clients except sender\r\n      socket.broadcast.emit(&#39;broadcast&#39;, &#39;hello friends!&#39;);\r\n\r\nThis will not emit the event to the client and you can have logic in your react app to listen to the socket event as well as the response of the http request.\r\nThis will prevent the duplication or bad data.\r\n\r\nIf there are multiple tabs open for the same client, the client tab which intiated the http request will update the state list with the http response and all other user&#39;s tabs or other users will receive the socket event.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015819/how-to-ignore-the-websocket-event-for-the-client-who-made-a-change-via-http/58095113#58095113","title":"How to ignore the websocket event for the client who made a change via HTTP?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":118,"user_id":1953079,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6f9a2feb6e299ae9a8ffb560e6bc8d6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"warchantua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1953079/warchantua"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569916504,"creation_date":1569916504,"answer_id":58180334,"question_id":58015819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58180334","body_markdown":"One approach would be to add a &quot;idempotency counter&quot; field in a request.

the values that will be rolled\r\n   (size is number of throws times number of dice)\r\n - Array named count that will have ten 0s which will be incremented\r\n   each time an occurrence is found\r\n - Start getting random numbers between 0 and the number of sides chosen\r\n   (if 0, it &quot;re-rolls&quot; till it&#39;s not 0 for that value) and stores them\r\n   in allNum[]\r\n - A small loop to print &quot;Throw &quot; + index&quot; every time the modulus\r\n   between the index and numDice is 0 to indicate the start of a new\r\n   throw\r\n - The actual checking of occurrences using &quot;temp&quot; as an index in\r\n   count[] and increasing the value of that index by 1\r\n - Print the number that appeared in the roll and how many times it\r\n   appeared (saying &quot;time&quot; if only once, &quot;times&quot; if multiple)\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like for this information that is printed to be represented in a bar chart, with the X values being each number that appeared and the Y values being the frequency of each value.\r\n\r\nThanks again for any help, sorry if the post is really long but I wanted to be as detailed as possible (see people on here often be shut down for not having enough info to help).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015808/using-data-in-arrays-to-generate-bar-chart-of-die-value-frequency","title":"Using data in arrays to generate bar

**VB.NET**, you may consider\r\n\r\n    text = Regex.Replace(text, &quot;(?&lt;=(?&lt;![^;])pass\\w*=).*?(?=;[\\w\\s]+=|$)&quot;, &quot;[HIDDEN]&quot;, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n    text = Regex.Replace(text, &quot;(?&lt;![^;])(pass\\w*=).*?(?=;[\\w\\s]+=|$)&quot;, &quot;$1[HIDDEN]&quot;, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)\r\n\r\nC# versions in case one needs this:\r\n\r\n    text = Regex.Replace(text, @&quot;(?&lt;=(?&lt;![^;])pass\\w*=).*?(?=;[\\w\\s]+=|$)&quot;, &quot;[HIDDEN]&quot;, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);\r\n    text = Regex.Replace(text, @&quot;(?&lt;![^;])(pass\\w*=).*?(?=;[\\w\\s]+=|$)&quot;, &quot;$1[HIDDEN]&quot;, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);\r\n\r\n\r\nSee a [lookbehind regex demo][1] and the [capturing group solution demo][2].\r\n\r\n**Details**\r\n\r\n - `(?i)` - case insensitive modifier (or `RegexOptions.IgnoreCase`)\r\n - `(?&lt;=(?&lt;![^;])pass\\w*=)`  - a positive lookbehind that requires a string `pass` (preceded with `,` or start of string position) + any 0 or more word chars followed with `=` immediately to the left of the current location\r\n - `.*?` - any 0+ chars other than an LF symbol as few as possible\r\n - `(?=;[\\w\\s]+=|$)` - a position in string immediately followed with `;`, 1+ word or whitespace chars and `=` or end of string.\r\n\r\nIn the capturing group solution, the captured substring is put back into the result using `$1` placeholder.\r\n\r\n**Why `(?&lt;![^;])` and not `(?&lt;=^|;)`**? Because an alternation in an unanchored lookbehind is costly in terms of performance. It makes sense to minimize the overhead if an equivalent pattern without alternation exists. `(?&lt;![^;])` matches any location that is either at the start of string or preceded with `;`, so it should be preferred. This kind of pattern is not possible if the left-hand side context is a multicharacter string, or if the multiline mode is required, though.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://regexstorm.net/tester?p=%28%3F%3C%3D%28%3F%3C!%5B%5E%3B%5D%29pass%5Cw*%3D%29.*%3F%28%3F%3D%3B%5B%5Cw%5Cs%5D%2B%3D%7C%24%29&amp;i=Password%3DMyPa%3B%24sW0%3D%3Fd%3BDatabase%3DDBNAME%0D%0AHost%3DSERVERNAME%3BPort%3D%23%23%23%23%3BDatabase%3DDBNAME%3BUsername%3DUSERID%3BPassword%3DMyPa%24%24Word%3BIntegrated%20Security%3DFalse%0D%0AHost%3DSERVERNAME%3BPort%3D9999%3BPassword%3DMyPa%24%24Word%3BDatabase%3DDBNAME%3BUsername%3DUSERID%3BIntegrated%20Security%3DFalse%0D%0AHost%3DSERVERNAME%3BPort%3D9999%3BDatabase%3DDBNAME%3BUsername%3DUSERID%3BIntegrated%20Security%3DFalse%3BPassword%3DMyPa%24%24Word&amp;r=%5BHIDDEN%5D&amp;o=im\r\n  [2]: http://regexstorm.net/tester?p=%28%3f%3c!%5b%5e%3b%5d%29%28pass%5cw*%3d%29.*%3f%28%3f%3d%3b%5b%5cw%5cs%5d%2b%3d%7c%24%29&amp;i=Password%3dMyPa%3b%24sW0%3d%3fd%3bDatabase%3dDBNAME%0d%0aHost%3dSERVERNAME%3bPort%3d%23%23%23%23%3bDatabase%3dDBNAME%3bUsername%3dUSERID%3bPassword%3dMyPa%24%24Word%3bIntegrated+Security%3dFalse%0d%0aHost%3dSERVERNAME%3bPort%3d9999%3bPassword%3dMyPa%24%24Word%3bDatabase%3dDBNAME%3bUsername%3dUSERID%3bIntegrated+Security%3dFalse%0d%0aHost%3dSERVERNAME%3bPort%3d9999%3bDatabase%3dDBNAME%3bUsername%3dUSERID%3bIntegrated+Security%3dFalse%3bPassword%3dMyPa%24%24Word&amp;r=%241%5bHIDDEN%5d&amp;o=im","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015807/using-positive-lookahead-and-lookbehind-to-mask-password-in-database-connection/58015945#58015945","title":"Using Positive LookAhead and LookBehind To Mask Password In Database Connection String"}],"owner":{"reputation":336,"user_id":2569697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/q9odU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"G_Hosa_Phat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2569697/g-hosa-phat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58015945,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569224862,"creation_date":1568912422,"question_id":58015807,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015807","body_markdown":"I have an exception handler method in my VB.NET application that retrieves details from the last exception to occur and e-mails that information to our Help Desk (me) for diagnostics and troubleshooting. One instance of a possible exception is when the application attempts to connect or execute some SQL on one of our database servers. In those cases - especially when the exception is because of a failure to connect - I want to see the database connection string that&#39;s being used to make certain it&#39;s properly formatted.\r\n\r\nHowever, database connection strings usually contain the user&#39;s ID and password, and I want to mask the password within the string. The challenge, however, is that we connect to multiple database types (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MS Access, etc.) and, depending on the database, there may or may not be a password in the connection string. Also, connection string formats vary from one provider to the next.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m *extremely* unfamiliar with RegEx but, using https://regexr.com/, I&#39;ve managed to come up with the following RegEx pattern that seems to work *sometimes*:\r\n\r\n`(?&lt;=;?[Pp][Aa][Ss][Ss].*=)(.*?)(?=;)|$`\r\n\r\nAn example connection string would look like this:\r\n\r\n`Host=SERVERNAME;Port=####;Database=DBNAME;Username=USERID;Password=MyPa$$Word;Integrated Security=False`\r\n\r\nThe pattern above correctly matches `MyPa$$Word` in the string if it&#39;s explicitly in this order, but if I move the `Password` key/value pair closer to the beginning of the connection string like this:\r\n\r\n`Host=SERVERNAME;Port=9999;Password=MyPa$$Word;Database=DBNAME;Username=USERID;Integrated Security=False`\r\n\r\nit then matches `MyPa$$Word`, `DBNAME`, *and* `USERID`.  If I move it to the end of the string:\r\n\r\n`Host=SERVERNAME;Port=9999;Database=DBNAME;Username=USERID;Integrated Security=False;Password=MyPa$$Word`\r\n\r\nthe pattern doesn&#39;t find *any* matches. Just to make sure the key/value with the space (`Integrated Security=False`) wasn&#39;t confusing the pattern, I removed that from the string and got the same results.\r\n\r\nBecause the connection string may be structured in a variety of ways depending on the database type, the user input, etc., I&#39;d like to be able to use RegEx to find the (case-insensitive) password key/value pair anywhere in the connection string, extract only the actual password value, and replace it with something (like `[HIDDEN]`).  I know that I could probably just do a `String.Split(Convert.ToChar(&quot;;&quot;))` on the whole connection string and check each key/value pair, but I&#39;d prefer to do it with RegEx, if possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015807/using-positive-lookahead-and-lookbehind-to-mask-password-in-database-connection","title":"Using Positive LookAhead and LookBehind To Mask Password In Database Connection String"},{"tags":["active-directory","single-sign-on"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568912705,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435478,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435478_58015805"},{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":440204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c364594f3313bb143652866f0763c23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rene marxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440204/rene-marxis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568912836,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435540_58015805"},{"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568912893,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435572,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435572_58015805"},{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":440204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c364594f3313bb143652866f0763c23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rene marxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440204/rene-marxis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568912955,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435600,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435600_58015805"},{"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568913088,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435655,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435655_58015805"},{"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":440204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c364594f3313bb143652866f0763c23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rene marxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440204/rene-marxis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":96,"user_id":11317682,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xJiET.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"KamaranL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11317682/kamaranl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568913147,"post_id":58015805,"comment_id":102435685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58015805/active-directory-and-single-sign-on#comment102435685_58015805"}],"owner":{"reputation":128,"user_id":440204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c364594f3313bb143652866f0763c23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rene marxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/440204/rene-marxis"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568912412,"creation_date":1568912412,"question_id":58015805,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58015805","body_markdown":"can someone tell me if there is any Microsoft product to be used with Active Direcotry in order to do Single Sign-on?
