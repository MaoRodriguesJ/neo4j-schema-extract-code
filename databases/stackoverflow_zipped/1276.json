It&#39;s still unclear to me how can I store data globally and retrieve it whenever I need them and/or retrieve them on the other FXML forms.\r\n\r\nHere is what I just started. First, I made a public java class for storing and retrieving my data.\r\n\r\n**TestPassData.java**\r\n```\r\npublic class TestPassData {\r\n\r\n    private static int PassData;\r\n\r\n    public static int getPassData() {\r\n        return PassData;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void setPassData(int PassData) {\r\n        TestPassData.PassData = PassData;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen a controller where I fetch the data from the database and store it to the TestPassData\r\n\r\n**FetchDataController.java**\r\n```\r\ncon = pst.prepareStatement(&quot;SELECT Emp_ID FROM Employee WHERE UserName = ? AND Password = ?&quot;);\r\npst.setString(1, un);\r\npst.setString(2, pw);\r\nrs = pst.executeQuery();\r\n\r\nwhile(rs.next()){\r\n      TestPassData.setPassData(rs.getInt(&quot;Emp_ID&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen here&#39;s where my problem is.

They need an internet connection in order to work. All are considered &quot;Best effort&quot; and offer no guarantees. If the client is not online, 1 notification per app will be cached and attempted to be delivered when the user next has a connection. If another notification comes into APNs while one is cached, the first will be deleted and never be sent to the user.\r\n\r\nThe ones you create locally are called LocalNotifications and obviously don&#39;t require an internet connection.\r\n\r\nYou could use Silent notifications to trigger an app to wake up and do a short amount of work, and perhaps then fire a local notification if necessary. But as you mention there are limitations to how often you can use it and still no guarantees.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to keep an app running in the background forever. Running networking code in the background is extremely draining on the battery and is blocked for that reason. The modes you are referring too are the only way (without jailbreaking) to do this. The only option to run code in the background is using background app refresh, requesting 30 seconds of time every X (where X is decided by the system, could be minutes, could be hours, could be days ... depending on the users usage of your app and others). Background app refresh can also be disabled per app in iOS settings.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure what your use case is, but the functionality you have described is not possible. I don&#39;t know if using an SMS gateway to send text messages instead is an option as those will have higher SLA&#39;s and won&#39;t require an internet connection. But unlike APNs, its not free.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238797/how-to-create-local-notifications-from-local-web-server-with-background-modes/58239316#58239316","title":"How to create local notifications from local web server with Background Modes"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12079985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tO7Dzd58__M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3xwnW_vNOreGY2_MvIPYXdaTb3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JackieNBee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079985/jackienbee"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12079985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tO7Dzd58__M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc3xwnW_vNOreGY2_MvIPYXdaTb3Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JackieNBee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12079985/jackienbee"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570202725,"creation_date":1570200898,"last_edit_date":1570201865,"question_id":58238797,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238797","body_markdown":"I&#39;m developing an App that communicates with a local Web Server and receives data from it (though WebSockets or HTTP) without using internet connection. \r\n\r\nSo I need to find a way to receive push notifications from the server without using Apple Push Notifications service even with the iPhone in standby so the notifications show up on Apple Watch.

Again no error about missing returns in the code bellow.\r\n```csharp\r\npublic string ValidateLogin(string auth)\r\n{\r\n\tusing (new NoDispose())\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tusing (new NoDispose())\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\ttry\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tint dtRowsCount = 10;\r\n\t\t\t\tstring authDesignation = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\tif (dtRowsCount &lt;= 0)\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn &quot;WrongPasswordArea&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\tswitch (authDesignation)\r\n\t\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase &quot;Admin&quot;:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn &quot;AdminDashboard&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase &quot;Security&quot;:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn &quot;SecurityDashboard&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase &quot;SecurityDashboard&quot;:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn &quot;SecurityDashboard&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcase &quot;Visitor&quot;:\r\n\t\t\t\t\tdefault:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\treturn &quot;VisitorDashboard&quot;;\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tcatch (Exception ex)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tthrow ex;\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Disclaimer.

The downside of that is needing an additional overload for lvalue references in case you want to be able to copy from those.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238751/c-move-constructors-without-rvalue-references/58238897#58238897","title":"C++ move constructors without rvalue references?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":558513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c475d271ef3adfd2d02b80ee7a7c0b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CyberMarine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/558513/cybermarine"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571319367,"creation_date":1571319367,"answer_id":58434014,"question_id":58238751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58434014","body_markdown":"My &quot;paraphrased&quot; code actually comes from the code referenced by [this][1] question so my question had already been asked and answered.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/17715794/558513","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238751/c-move-constructors-without-rvalue-references/58434014#58434014","title":"C++ move constructors without rvalue references?"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":558513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c475d271ef3adfd2d02b80ee7a7c0b01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CyberMarine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/558513/cybermarine"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58238897,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571319367,"creation_date":1570200760,"question_id":58238751,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238751","body_markdown":"I just found some code in Boost paraphrased as the following:\r\n\r\n    class A {};\r\n    \r\n    class B {\r\n    public:\r\n      B(A a): a_(std::move(a)) {}\r\n    private:\r\n      A a_;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n      A a;\r\n      B b(std::move(a));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAssuming this works, why use move constructor/assignment with an rvalue reference?

I tried naively to just include it in a slide, knowing that there would probably have a conflict between reveal.js css and leaflet, which is the case. As you could see in the following screenshot, there are some unknown black lines on my leaflet map.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    title: &quot;Untitled&quot;\r\n    output:\r\n      revealjs::revealjs_presentation:\r\n        self_contained: false\r\n    ---\r\n    \r\n    ## Slide with a widget\r\n    \r\n    ```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\n    library(leaflet)\r\n    library(magrittr)\r\n    leaflet() %&gt;%\r\n      addTiles()\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n[![no-iframe][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHowever note that, at this point, the widget will resize correctly if the screen size changes.\r\n\r\nI assumed that encapsulating the leaflet widget in an iframe could potentially solve my problem of weird black lines since they are probably created by reveal.js itself (which would not be loaded in the iframe).\r\n\r\nEffectively, that solved the problem of the black lines, but unfortunately, the widget won&#39;t resize to the window this time. I suppose this is due to the iframe being resized when the screen size changes, but not the widget inside the iframe.\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    title: &quot;Untitled&quot;\r\n    output:\r\n      revealjs::revealjs_presentation:\r\n        self_contained: false\r\n    ---\r\n    \r\n    ## Slide with a widget\r\n    \r\n    ```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\n    library(leaflet)\r\n    library(magrittr)\r\n    library(widgetframe)\r\n    frameWidget({leaflet() %&gt;%\r\n      addTiles()\r\n    })\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n[![iframe][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe net effect is that if a create the slides on my laptop and display them on my laptop, using the iframe works fine, but if I want to project my slides on a projector, then the widget is being too small for the (newly resized) iframe, which results in white padding for the unused part of the iframe.\r\n\r\nAny ways of solving my problem is welcome. I guess two possible ways are:\r\n\r\n1. Use some CSS trick instead of encapsulating my leaflet map in an iframe\r\n1. Make the widget inside the iframe to resize when the iframe is resized\r\n\r\nI unfortunately am not able to make work any of both, largely due to my (very) very limited skills in html/js/css. I&#39;ll work on them as soon as I have some time, but I need your help on that for now.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2t3LT.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9MNtX.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238740/use-htmlwidgets-with-revealjs-in-rmarkdown","title":"Use htmlwidgets with revealjs in rmarkdown"},{"tags":["javascript","outlook","office-js","office-addins"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4343,"user_id":7823505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWz8s.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Outlook Add-ins Team - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823505/outlook-add-ins-team-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570209595,"post_id":58238735,"comment_id":102853792,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238735/determine-whether-we-are-in-compose-mode-or-edit-mode#comment102853792_58238735"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":5075723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CntJ2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lifeTech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5075723/lifetech"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4343,"user_id":7823505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWz8s.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Outlook Add-ins Team - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823505/outlook-add-ins-team-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570222338,"post_id":58238735,"comment_id":102858305,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238735/determine-whether-we-are-in-compose-mode-or-edit-mode#comment102858305_58238735"},{"owner":{"reputation":4343,"user_id":7823505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWz8s.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Outlook Add-ins Team - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823505/outlook-add-ins-team-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570474890,"post_id":58238735,"comment_id":102917808,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238735/determine-whether-we-are-in-compose-mode-or-edit-mode#comment102917808_58238735"},{"owner":{"reputation":4343,"user_id":7823505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vWz8s.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Outlook Add-ins Team - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823505/outlook-add-ins-team-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570474947,"post_id":58238735,"comment_id":102917835,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238735/determine-whether-we-are-in-compose-mode-or-edit-mode#comment102917835_58238735"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":5075723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CntJ2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lifeTech","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5075723/lifetech"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19416,"user_id":3077495,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZE6fb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cindy Meister","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3077495/cindy-meister"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570201295,"creation_date":1570200718,"last_edit_date":1570201295,"question_id":58238735,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238735","body_markdown":"Am working on an outlook add-in and using the OfficeJS API provided by Microsoft.

Can I please get some help ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238735/determine-whether-we-are-in-compose-mode-or-edit-mode","title":"determine whether we are in compose mode or edit mode"},{"tags":["excel"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3302715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43954b8ac808a34c6a0a5ead7f08c5c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3302715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3302715/user3302715"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570201669,"post_id":58238812,"comment_id":102850594,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238733/excel-function-to-find-any-given-column-value-as-substring-in-another-cell/58238812#comment102850594_58238812"},{"owner":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3302715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43954b8ac808a34c6a0a5ead7f08c5c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3302715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3302715/user3302715"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202199,"post_id":58238812,"comment_id":102850843,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238733/excel-function-to-find-any-given-column-value-as-substring-in-another-cell/58238812#comment102850843_58238812"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":3302715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43954b8ac808a34c6a0a5ead7f08c5c2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3302715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3302715/user3302715"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570205212,"post_id":58238812,"comment_id":102852161,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238733/excel-function-to-find-any-given-column-value-as-substring-in-another-cell/58238812#comment102852161_58238812"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":104684,"user_id":4851590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9xlEi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Craner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4851590/scott-craner"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570202190,"last_edit_date":1570202190,"creation_date":1570200972,"answer_id":58238812,"question_id":58238733,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58238812","body_markdown":"Excel Formula:\r\n\r\n    =ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B1,A1))\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf complete word matches are wanted, for example `Hi` is does not match in `Hillside` then we can use:\r\n\r\n    =ISNUMBER(SEARCH(&quot; &quot; &amp; B1 &amp; &quot; &quot;,&quot; &quot; &amp; A1 &amp; &quot; &quot;))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n`SEARCH` is Case in-sensitive.

It can fuck things up. \r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\nHTML\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n        &lt;head&gt;\r\n            &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;menu.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n            &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;style.css&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/head&gt;\r\n        &lt;body&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;aaa&lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n\r\n    .trans {\r\n        text-align: center;\r\n        padding-top: 250px;\r\n        transition: 1s;\r\n        -moz-transition: 5s;\r\n        -ms-transition: 5s;\r\n        -o-transition: 5s;\r\n        -webkit-transition: 5s;\r\n    }    \r\n\r\n    .trans:hover {\r\n      background-color: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nScripts\r\n\r\n    document.getElementById(&quot;abc&quot;).innerHTML = &quot;menu&quot;;\r\n\r\nTry it out: https://jsfiddle.net/jlanssie/Ljhawtqx/5/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238721/javascript-causes-css-transition-to-not-work/58238959#58238959","title":"JavaScript causes CSS transition to not work"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1651,"user_id":4512005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000670968425/picture?type=large","display_name":"Razvan Zamfir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4512005/razvan-zamfir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1651,"user_id":4512005,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000670968425/picture?type=large","display_name":"Razvan Zamfir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4512005/razvan-zamfir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570203398,"last_edit_date":1570203398,"creation_date":1570203001,"answer_id":58239387,"question_id":58238721,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58239387","body_markdown":"`document.write(str)` will overwrite tour document so `&lt;div class=&quot;abc&quot;&gt;menu&lt;/div&gt;` will *replace* `&lt;div class=&quot;trans&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;` and that causes your *entire* CSS not to work, *not just transitions*.

There are two Select menus, one for sensor ID (132, 133, ...), and one for variable (Temperature, Dew Point, ...). When the user changes either value, the graph is supposed to update with the selected data. \r\n\r\nThe data I&#39;m using is in a Panda Dataframe, where there is a column &#39;dt&#39; which contains the one minute interval datetime objects, and the data are in columns that follow the naming convention &#39;Temp132&#39;, &#39;Temp 133&#39;, &#39;Dew132&#39;, &#39;Dew133&#39;, etc. Ideally, the user selected values from the Select menus would be combined to make a string that could be used to extract a data series out of df (&#39;Temp&#39; + &#39;132&#39; would be used to call df[&#39;Temp132&#39;]).\r\n\r\nUsing print statements, I can see that when the user changes a value in the Select menu, the ColumnDataSource is getting updated.

Not just because they are easier to use and manipulate but also they provide serious performance improvements. Even the spark document recommends the same.\r\n\r\nHere goes your dataframe code :-\r\n\r\n    val spark = SparkSession.builder.master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate\r\n\r\nThis creates a `SparkSession` which is an entry point to the application.\r\n\r\nNow, lets read your employee and department files.\r\n\r\n    val employeeDF = spark.read.format(&quot;csv&quot;).option(&quot;header&quot;,&quot;true&quot;).load(&quot;/path/to/employee/file&quot;)\r\n    val deptDF = spark.read.format(&quot;csv&quot;).option(&quot;header&quot;,&quot;true&quot;).load(&quot;/path/to/dept/file&quot;)\r\n\r\nNow, joining is pretty easy. Below statement will create a dataframe which will be the result of inner join between `employeeDF` and `deptDF` on column `deptno` \r\n\r\n    val joinedDF = employeeDF.join(deptDF,Seq(&quot;deptno&quot;))\r\n\r\nNow, you can use the `joinedDF` to get your results.\r\n\r\n    val countByDept = joinedDF.groupBy($&quot;deptno&quot;).count\r\n    //countByDept.show to display the results\r\n\r\n    val top2Dept = joinedDF.groupBy($&quot;dname&quot;).count.orderBy($&quot;count&quot;.desc).limit(2)\r\n    //top2Dept.show to display the results\r\n\r\nHope this gets you started on your journey with Spark DataFrames and DataSets.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238690/count-employee-by-department-id-identify-top-two-departments-with-the-most-emp/58249039#58249039","title":"Count employee by department ID &amp; identify top two departments with the most employee IDs"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":169,"user_id":9569498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-p5iz9l6n7aw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAaw/CTob2dQ4WOk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Manish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9569498/manish"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570369983,"creation_date":1570369983,"answer_id":58257916,"question_id":58238690,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58257916","body_markdown":"Here is my pyspark code to do this.

trust totally, in sense that my code will never be copied or leaked.\r\n\r\nThe largest companies in the world trust these big cloud providers to keep their data safe and secure, and to reliably run large parts of their [multi-billion dollar businesses][1]. Millions of servers, thousands upon thousands of petabytes of data, billions in revenue. **If Google Cloud is good enough for companies like The Mayo Clinic, Paypal, Ebay, and Chevron, it&#39;s probably good enough for you.**\r\n\r\n&gt; as any hosting company has full access to the server, they can easily copy the entire code and do whatever they want?\r\n\r\nNo they cannot. In the case of Google Cloud, data is encrypted at rest by default.

I am trying to do this as succinctly as possible and not have a ton of unused information in the struct I&#39;m using to call the actual write function. Currently I have this as a basic structure (this is just a rough draft): \r\n```\r\ntypedef int (*Write_Out) (char *src, size_t len);\r\n\r\ntypedef struct\ts_vas_info\r\n{\r\n\tchar **ret;\r\n\tint prev_size;\r\n}\t\t\t\tt_vas_info;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct\ts_vd_info\r\n{\r\n\tint fd;\r\n}\t\t\t\tt_vd_info;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct\ts_vf_info\r\n{\r\n\tFILE *fp;\r\n}\t\t\t\tt_vf_info;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct\ts_vsn_info\r\n{\r\n\tsize_t size;\r\n\tchar * restrict str;\r\n}\t\t\t\tt_vsn_info;\r\n\r\ntypedef struct\ts_writer\r\n{\r\n\tint curr;\r\n\tWrite_Out ft_write;\r\n}\t\t\t\tt_writer;\r\n```\r\nWhere Write_Out will point to the function that sends output to the right destination, t_writer will hold all information to do this and the other structs are used when the corresponding function is called. Now I&#39;d really like for the s_writer type to have one more member that contains one of the other struct types (directly if possible, I&#39;m not looking to solve this with pointers and casts if at all avoidable). I am pretty new at this so I don&#39;t know if this is possible (either with these or other data types).

working on an action-based messaging extension. I have code getting the list of attachments from the message that the action was invoked from, but I&#39;m stuck on actually being able to get the attachment file. \r\n\r\nI found code over here that looks good:\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/botframework-sdk/issues/4466\r\n\r\n    var attachment = turnContext.Activity.Attachments.First();\r\n    using (HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient())\r\n    {\r\n        // Skype &amp; MS Teams attachment URLs are secured by a JwtToken, so we need to pass the token from our bot.\r\n        if (turnContext.Activity.ChannelId.Equals(&quot;skype&quot;, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) || turnContext.Activity.ChannelId.Equals(&quot;msteams&quot;, StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase))\r\n        {\r\n            var token = await new MicrosoftAppCredentials().GetTokenAsync();\r\n            httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(&quot;Bearer&quot;, token);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        var responseMessage = await httpClient.GetAsync(attachment.ContentUrl);\r\n        var contentLenghtBytes = responseMessage.Content.Headers.ContentLength;\r\n        await turnContext.SendActivityAsync($&quot;Attachment of {attachment.ContentType} type and size of {contentLenghtBytes} bytes received.&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut I&#39;m unclear about the line for getting the token. First, MicrosoftAppCredentials doesn&#39;t have an empty constructor. If I try it using my bot app&#39;s ID and secret, when I try to get the content, I get a 401 Unauthorized error.\r\n\r\nI can understand that to use ContentUrl, I should need to pass a token, but

I&#39;ve been able to get a count of the # of times the MODEL is used per NBHD but I am stuck there.\r\n\r\nFirst, here&#39;s the code to create a temp table that should be representative of the data I&#39;m using.\r\n\r\n    create table temp_ctest (NBHD VARCHAR(2), MODEL VARCHAR(2));\r\n    \r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;B&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;B&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;D&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;A&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;1&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\r\n    insert into temp_ctest (NBHD, MODEL) VALUES (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;C&#39;);\t\r\n\r\nHere is the code I&#39;ve already used to retrieve the count for the # of times each MODEL is used per NBHD.\r\n\r\n    select nbhd, model, count(model) modelcount \r\n    from temp_ctest\r\n    group by nbhd, model \r\n    order by nbhd, modelcount desc;\r\n\r\nThis retrieved the following list:\r\n\r\nhttps://snipboard.io/UZ1x5L.jpg\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using over (partition by) but I&#39;m still fairly new to SQL and can&#39;t figure it out.\r\n\r\nThe results I&#39;m hoping to achieve is a subset of the list above.

What this code does is setup a listener at application startup then any email that comes in it checks anywhere in the  subject for &quot;JIRA&quot; since the subject line is always static just the 4 numbers change I break down the subject into an array using ```SPLIT()```. I then query the array for the portion of the subject I need and use ```MID()``` to just extract the ID I need for the URL. Once the URL is complete I join the portions of the URL together into one variable which outputs the complete URL I need to execute. From there I launch and execute the browser using ```CreateObject(&quot;Shell.Application&quot;)``` and thats that it works :D! One thing to mention here is that in order for this to work the script has to be placed in ```ThisOutlookSession``` Under Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Project when you hit ALT + F11 while in outlook and after the script is saved you have to restart outlook for it to load. You also have to go to Trust Center which is located under FILE -&gt; Options -&gt; Trust Center click the Trust Center Settings Button and under that menu select &quot;Macro Settings&quot; and set the option to &quot;Notifications for all macros&quot;\r\nthat way it will notify you to enable macros when outlook is launched. The lines of code that are quoted out are 1. the msgbox which i was using to show me the output of my variables and 2. at the very end other items I can query from the email itself.

I have done no other steps than those stated above. I should not be receiving concurrency errors for something I alone am testing unless I purposefully did it i.e. Open a page to edit it, edit the item on a second page and then return to try and edit the first page.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help? Have I done something stupid? The primary key and row version values are in my model and show correctly in my SQL DB design.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nAdded the code for the *Edit.cshtml.cs* as requested.\r\n```csharp\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()\r\n{\r\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n        return Page();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    _context.Attach(Fileset).State = EntityState.Modified;\r\n\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\r\n    }\r\n    catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)\r\n    {\r\n        if (!FilesetExists(Fileset.Id))\r\n        {\r\n            return NotFound();\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            throw;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return RedirectToPage(&quot;./Index&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have not amended it yet, so should be as default, created by the scaffolding process.\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\n\r\nAfter Neil&#39;s answer and comments below, I have updated my OnPostAsync method.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[BindProperty]\r\npublic Fileset Fileset { get; set; }\r\npublic SelectList FilesetSL { get; set; }\r\n\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync(int id)\r\n{\r\n    if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n        return Page();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    _context.Attach(Fileset).State = EntityState.Modified;\r\n\r\n    var filesetToUpdate = await _context.Fileset\r\n        .FirstOrDefaultAsync(m =&gt; m.Id == id);\r\n\r\n    if (filesetToUpdate == null)\r\n    {\r\n        return HandleDeletedFileset();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Update the RowVersion to the value when this entity was\r\n    // fetched.

on your comment that:\r\n\r\n&gt; i&#39;m using this function to extract some results that i need to use later in the program\r\n\r\nIt does sound like you need to return the results of `fetchAll()` from the function.\r\n\r\nThis is easily achieved:\r\n\r\n    function data_extraction($sql) {\r\n        $query = $co-&gt;prepare($sql);\r\n        $query-&gt;execute();\r\n        $arr = $query-&gt;fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);\r\n        return $arr;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis will return the `array` produced by `fetchAll()` to callers of your function.\r\n\r\nNote: You probably don&#39;t want to return `$query` as this will give an outside caller access to your prepared statement.\r\n\r\nTo utilise in your code:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    $results = data_extraction(&#39;SELECT xyz...&#39;);\r\n\r\nReplacing the `SELECT xyz...` statement with your chosen SQL statement.\r\n\r\n**NOTE**\r\n\r\nFollowing an important comment by @YourCommonSense regarding parameterisation of PDO prepared statements, I urge extreme caution when injecting user content into SQL statements without the use of parameters.  The reference provided by @YourCommonSense is [here][1] which has a glorious description of the issue and how to resolve it.\r\n\r\nThis answer is to primarily address the question `Do I use a return statement?` not `How do I safely use PDO prepared statements`\r\n\r\n  [1]:

been reading up on logging, and I think I understand what is happening but I do not know how to correct it. I have a file where I want to set up my logger, and then I want my application to use that configured logger, here is my `logger.py` file:\r\n\r\n    import logging\r\n    import sys\r\n    \r\n    logger = logging.getLogger(&#39;mylogger&#39;)\r\n    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\r\n    # create console handler and set level to debug\r\n    ch = logging.StreamHandler()\r\n    ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\r\n    \r\n    # create formatter\r\n    formatter = logging.Formatter(\r\n        &#39;{levelname} {asctime} {name} {lineno}: {message}&#39;, style=&#39;{&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    # add formatter to ch\r\n    ch.setFormatter(formatter)\r\n    \r\n    # add ch to logger\r\n    logger.addHandler(ch)\r\n\r\nNow, I have another file that handles certain functionality and it needs to use this logger. Let&#39;s call it `some_class.py` So what I have done is:\r\n\r\n    import logging\r\n    \r\n    logger = logging.getLogger(&#39;mylogger.someClass&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class SomeClass:\r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            pass\r\n    \r\n        def do_something(self):\r\n            logger.critical(&#39;A critical message&#39;)\r\n\r\nNow in a `runner.py` file I do:\r\n\r\n    import logger\r\n    \r\n    from some_class import SomeClass\r\n    \r\n    SomeClass().do_something()\r\n\r\n\r\nMy output is:\r\n\r\n    CRITICAL 2019-10-04 07:38:38,579 mylogger 25: critical message\r\n    CRITICAL 2019-10-04 07:38:38,592 mylogger.SomeClass 12: A critical message\r\n\r\nNow the problem is that I only want to show the class-level logger&#39;s message. I have also tried moving the logger inside the class as a class variable and then referring to `self.logger` instead but it yields the same result. Is there a way to disable the root logger or how would I only get one log message in this case?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238598/python-logger-logs-twice","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Python Logger Logs Twice"},{"tags":["laravel","eloquent"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5068,"user_id":999617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fba9229a54aba29fe9efb1e3e9b6c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vincent Decaux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/999617/vincent-decaux"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570200337,"post_id":58238593,"comment_id":102849911,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238593/laravel-scope-with-join-query#comment102849911_58238593"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":6613863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wi18g.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larry Kagan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6613863/larry-kagan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46,"user_id":6613863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wi18g.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larry Kagan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6613863/larry-kagan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570226247,"last_edit_date":1570226247,"creation_date":1570210526,"answer_id":58240936,"question_id":58238593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58240936","body_markdown":"The only difference between `$workorders = $workorders-&gt;get();` and `$usersWO = User::Orders()-&gt;get();` is the output format.

Or possibly a combination of serveral.\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you&#39;re specifying font sizes in `pt` or `em` NOT `px`. The reason for this is `kerning tables` (usually built into the font) combine with font-smoothing and converting pixel to print sizes can cause artifacts.\r\n\r\n2. In the past I&#39;ve experienced the Google Font downloaded to my computer was physically different than what is streamed via javascript from the service. I assume they don&#39;t get updated at the same time. If you can try letting Google&#39;s server provide the font each time. Or can you try finding the files elsewhere? (this sounds like a corrupted font file)\r\n\r\n3. If you are self-hosting the fonts, make sure that your server is sending them with the correct MIME type. Here&#39;s a [list][1] of what they should be. You can change that in IIS or your `.htaccess` file depending on the server environment you have. *I know this seems strange since it&#39;s only one font, but the other&#39;s you&#39;ve tried could be loading a different font type (ttf, otf, etc) that what the browser is getting for Muli*\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf none of that helps could you post more of you&#39;re CSS including how the fonts are loaded and how they&#39;re set to display (size, smoothing, line-height, etc)?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#font","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238591/muli-font-is-not-rendering-properly/58240064#58240064","title":"Muli font is not rendering properly"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":501,"user_id":12056434,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6929f6ce32d4eb08489d87bbf512b9b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piyush Teraiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12056434/piyush-teraiya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570442249,"creation_date":1570442249,"answer_id":58267244,"question_id":58238591,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58267244","body_markdown":"You can use this code\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot;
