It is not so important where exactly this point is, because the delay (as long as it is a constant delay) will be compensated.\r\n\r\nUsually when you use PTP, you have a hardware timestamping unit (TSU) which has a digital clock that can be adjusted from software. Timestamping can be either be implemented in the PHY (the chip that drives the wire), or in the MAC (the periphery of the CPU that buffers the frames until the software has time to read them).\r\n\r\nWhen a PTP frame is recognized, usually the current timestamp plus the PTP sequence number and message type are stored into a separate memory for the CPU to fetch later. The CPU will then use this information to adjust the clock of the TSU (usually not the same as to the normal system time seen from the OS). The TSU clock is then used by application-programmed hardware, e.g. to timestamp external signals, or to generate precise pulses. It is usually *not* used directly by the software, because that would add back many of the unpredictable latencies that were avoided by having hardware timestamping.\r\n\r\nYou cannot just append the timestamp to the frame, because then the CPU cannot get any transmit timestamps. If the software does any kind of timestamping on the CPU, the precision of PTP is usually lost, because of a lot of uncertainties (like interrupt latency, scheduler latency, queues, etc.)\r\n\r\nHowever, PTP frames also contain a *correction field* which can be adjusted on the fly by hardware components, e.g. a switch may add the forwarding delay directly into the frame, modifying it on the fly, and calculating a new checksum.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180165/ptp-1588-timestamps/58186595#58186595","title":"PTP 1588 timestamps"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12147097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3430b7fd203dc5c774ee99c5112119cf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anuj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12147097/anuj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2139,"user_id":2224047,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UZ83S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nikolay  Shevchenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2224047/nikolay-shevchenko"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569939349,"creation_date":1569915799,"last_edit_date":1569926123,"question_id":58180165,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58180165","body_markdown":"In `PTP` **1588**, timestamped packets means the time when first bit of `PTP` packet leaves the device pin? \r\n\r\nDoes that mean if that time has to be fed in the packet, `PTP` stack should know how much time from a given stage in `PTP` stack till the device pin will be taken by that `PTP` packet? \r\n\r\nso that time can be pre-fed in the packet?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180165/ptp-1588-timestamps","title":"PTP 1588 timestamps"},{"tags":["php","authentication"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1973,"user_id":8113391,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fniwe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MorganFreeFarm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8113391/morganfreefarm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569915894,"post_id":58180164,"comment_id":102740482,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180164/authentication-in-php-session-timeout#comment102740482_58180164"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":10607359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8273ec7b961070be3ed7c47af65e9a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"klaas123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10607359/klaas123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569916729,"post_id":58180242,"comment_id":102740874,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180164/authentication-in-php-session-timeout/58180242#comment102740874_58180242"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9227978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3a36f5cdb6343b59058a65ab0dbffe2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ajay Shukla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9227978/ajay-shukla"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":37,"user_id":10607359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8273ec7b961070be3ed7c47af65e9a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"klaas123","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10607359/klaas123"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569921334,"post_id":58180242,"comment_id":102743210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180164/authentication-in-php-session-timeout/58180242#comment102743210_58180242"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9227978,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3a36f5cdb6343b59058a65ab0dbffe2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ajay Shukla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9227978/ajay-shukla"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569916114,"creation_date":1569916114,"answer_id":58180242,"question_id":58180164,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58180242","body_markdown":"Please try this code.\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n              session_start();\r\n              $t=time();\r\n              if (isset($_SESSION[&#39;logged&#39;]) &amp;&amp;

Here are some tips on what to do if you find any “mixed content&quot; or &quot;insecure content” errors and how to fix them.\r\n\r\nWhat Is Mixed Content And How Do These Errors Arise?\r\nWhen you visit a website which is fully SSL encrypted, you’re accessing the content over `https://` and your internet browser is aware of this.\r\n\r\nIf any of your content is being served via a `non-https://` URL, your browser will pick up on this. Depending on the internet browser this can result in an “insecure content” warning for example, or the content could be blocked altogether.\r\n\r\nHow Can I Investigate Mixed Or Insecure Content Errors?\r\nIf you think you may have content on a page of yours that is being blocked or bringing up certificate warnings, use the steps below for a handy trick on locating that mixed content. `Google Chrome` makes it really easy to do this, however, most modern browsers will have the same tools.\r\n\r\nAccess your live website\r\nIn the top right-hand corner of the browser click the browser menu (often looks like three lines)\r\nClick &quot;More Tools&quot;\r\nClick &quot;Developer Tools&quot;\r\nA new menu will now open\r\nUsing either the top menu bar on this page or the bottom one, locate the “Console” tab\r\nAs an alternative to the steps above you can also access the Console area by **right-clicking the page &gt; click &quot;Inspect Element &gt; click &quot;Console&quot;**.\r\n\r\nThis Console area will display any insecure or non https:// content via mixed content errors or warnings. \r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve Found An Error - How Do I Fix The Content?\r\nFor an idea on the type of content that could be causing an error to take a look at our guide &quot;**How To Ensure Your Website Content Is Secure**&quot;. With this in mind, look at a specific error using the steps above.\r\n\r\nThe error might read something like:\r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;Mixed Content: the page at https://yourdomainname.co.uk/page.html was\r\n&gt; loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure image\r\n&gt; http://yourdomainname.co.uk/page/image.jpg&quot;\r\n\r\nIn this case, it will be an image that is causing the error, due to it being loaded via http:// instead of https://. If you click on the second URL (the http:// one), it will show you the insecure content.\r\n\r\nFixing the content will depend on the error shown.

How to prevent the Arduino from recording and storing such abrupt values? \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6LU5L.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3bzMl.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180108/abrupt-jumps-in-the-arduino-uno-sensor-data-output","title":"Abrupt jumps in the Arduino UNO sensor data output"},{"tags":["reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1013,"user_id":8120827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b0646c9ea234df80d26c35e88b97d730?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ga&#235;l S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8120827/ga%c3%abl-s"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569915658,"post_id":58180106,"comment_id":102740360,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180106/static-sites-for-react-recomendation#comment102740360_58180106"},{"owner":{"reputation":4925,"user_id":8437099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gLxab.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zynkn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8437099/zynkn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569915756,"post_id":58180106,"comment_id":102740411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180106/static-sites-for-react-recomendation#comment102740411_58180106"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12146961,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_oxr7Q1pQmc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reThSUH2bWilDQ-ON1GIhMxDVFT1Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"andriejka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12146961/andriejka"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569918608,"post_id":58180477,"comment_id":102741778,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180106/static-sites-for-react-recomendation/58180477#comment102741778_58180477"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":416,"user_id":11988581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PgYm7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Winston","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11988581/winston"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569917002,"creation_date":1569917002,"answer_id":58180477,"question_id":58180106,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58180477","body_markdown":"You should consider using Next.JS or Gatsby.

receive the error:\r\n\r\n&gt; The process cannot access the file &#39;file path&#39; because it is being\r\n&gt; used by another process\r\n\r\nIf so, just close the editor where you have the file opened and everything should be working as expected.\r\n\r\n**Another tip**: Instead of concatenating to get the path, try to use `Path.Combine` instead.\r\n\r\n**EDIT after comments:**\r\nAs @PanagiotisKanavos mentioned in a comment:\r\n\r\n&gt; c:\\whatever.png isn&#39;t valid for Linux.

As AWS supports App mesh using envoy proxy for service discovery and load balancing among micro-services, I thought this would be the correct solution to achieve load-balanced communication. However, we are not using containers, I was wondering how we can deploy a proxy in a sidecar pattern to achieve a service mesh?\r\nIs there any other way apart from service mesh through which I can

`markActive` the active year in your timeline. debounce it so we do not do a lot of processing on main thread.\r\n- Add the `markActive` method to `window.onload` for marking the active year in the

This is the correct interface implementation for your `PackageVersionNumber` struct.\r\n\r\nThat means, the `other` argument value cannot be `null` no matter what you do.\r\n\r\nYou cannot even write `if (other == null)` - that will produce a compiler error (unless you overload the `==` operator for `PackageVersionNumber` what you should really consider for a struct, by the way).\r\n\r\nBut even with an overloaded `==` operator, the `if (other == null)` comparison will *always* yield `false` - so there is no need in that check. The overloaded operator will allow the compiler to implicitly cast `PackageVersionNumber` to nullable `PackageVersionNumber?` in the comparison - and you&#39;ll get a CS0472 warning:\r\n\r\n&gt; The result of the expression is always &#39;false&#39; since a value of type &#39;PackageVersionNumber&#39; is never equal to &#39;null&#39; of type &#39;PackageVersionNumber?&#39;\r\n\r\nI suppose that the &quot;Implement interface&quot; feature in Visual Studio doesn&#39;t consider the type on which the interface is implemented and always uses the same snippet with that `AllowNullAttribute`. \r\n\r\nThat attribute is indeed useful for implementing the interface for non-nullable reference types. While they are &quot;logically&quot; non-nullable, there is still a way to get a `null` value at runtime - so a null check is required to avoid a `NullReferenceException`. Furthermore, you have to ensure the backwards compatibility with assemblies compiled with C#7.x and below - `IComparable&lt;T&gt;` perfectly allows `null` for `T`s that are reference types.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180069/properly-implementing-icomparablet-on-a-struct-in-c-8-with-nullable-set-to-en/58181174#58181174","title":"Properly implementing IComparable&lt;T&gt; on a Struct in C# 8 with Nullable set to enable"}],"owner":{"reputation":7115,"user_id":26566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca93d6dd4666844d6b0e9fc1248d63ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"smack0007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/26566/smack0007"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5639,"user_id":1000551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d8cb0eaa4de7f781e42328ec7544ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vadim Kotov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1000551/vadim-kotov"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":84,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58181174,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571135052,"creation_date":1569915417,"last_edit_date":1571135052,"question_id":58180069,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58180069","body_markdown":"What is now the proper way to implement CompareTo in C# 8 when Nullable is enabled.

Ideally, you should be able to directly marshall a MySQL date into a date variable in your PHP script.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180068/how-to-check-if-two-variable-in-php-are-same-or-not/58180131#58180131","title":"How to check if two variable in php are same or not?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":5502456,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zZhYc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pattrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5502456/pattrick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569915777,"creation_date":1569915777,"answer_id":58180161,"question_id":58180068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58180161","body_markdown":"You should use PHP timestamp to compare the date, use strtotime($date) function to convert dates to timestamp it will be in integer format(in form of seconds) then you can easily compare them","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180068/how-to-check-if-two-variable-in-php-are-same-or-not/58180161#58180161","title":"How to check if two variable in php are same or not?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1451,"user_id":5356229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kst3z.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Firefog","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5356229/firefog"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58180131,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569915777,"creation_date":1569915410,"question_id":58180068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58180068","body_markdown":"I want to compare date with database ? so I preg all special character from the date. but some how it always return true  if both vale are not same.

trying out some animation stuffs from Apple&#39;s SwiftUI tutorials. The section [Add Animations to Individual Views](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/animating-views-and-transitions#add-animations-to-individual-views) says: \r\n\r\n&gt; A view’s color, opacity, rotation, size, and other properties are all animatable.\r\n\r\nBut when I tried animating the Image color with `foregroundColor(_:)` modifier by means of toggling the value of the `State` property, it doesn&#39;t seem to be actually animating. For the sake of the investigation, I added a duration for the animation to be longer. \r\n\r\n    struct ContentView: View {\r\n\r\n        @State var isFavorite = false\r\n\r\n        var body: some View {\r\n            Button(action: {\r\n                withAnimation(.easeInOut(duration: 5)) { self.isFavorite.toggle() }\r\n            }) {\r\n                Image(systemName: &quot;star.fill&quot;)\r\n                    .imageScale(.large)\r\n                    .foregroundColor(self.isFavorite ? .orange : .gray)\r\n                    .rotationEffect(.degrees(self.isFavorite ? 360 : 0))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the above code, the color change `orange &lt;&lt;-&gt;&gt; gray` happens immediately. However the rotation effect does respect the animation and it&#39;s interactive too. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Essentially not a duplicate:**\r\n\r\nI came across a similar question [SwiftUI: Animate Text color - foregroundColor()](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57832439/swiftui-animate-text-color-foregroundcolor) but that is about `Text` component. So I assume it&#39;s not a direct duplicate. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnd there is not enough documentation in the developer site about [foregroundColor(_:)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/image/3269646-foregroundcolor), so I assume the quote in the tutorials should be the source of truth. \r\n\r\nSo my question is whether it is a bug or an intentional behavior?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180063/animating-image-color-with-foregroundcolor-doesnt-actually-animate-interactivel","title":"Animating Image color with foregroundColor doesn&#39;t actually animate interactively"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","jestjs","single-page-application","enzyme"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":6712814,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BKsovYg2Yss/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAS9k/roWb2da3r_Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Carlos Crespo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6712814/carlos-crespo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570123641,"creation_date":1570123641,"answer_id":58224148,"question_id":58180062,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58224148","body_markdown":"In your `componentDidUpdate` you need to compare `prevProps` with current `props` before doing anything that can potentially change the current state of the component, otherwise you might end up having an infinite loop, as you can see on the documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate.\r\n\r\nSo your code should look like this:\r\n\r\n    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\r\n      if (prevProps.updateRequired !== this.props.updateRequired) {\r\n        console.log(this.props);\r\n        if (this.props.updateRequired === true) {\r\n            this.anotherFunc();\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log(&quot;update not required&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n      }    \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180062/how-to-test-componentdidupdate-without-ending-it-in-a-loop/58224148#58224148","title":"How to test componentDidUpdate without ending it in a loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12073977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4bd067864566858705b227ab537be41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DevCJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12073977/devcj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12073977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4bd067864566858705b227ab537be41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DevCJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12073977/devcj"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58224148,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570123641,"creation_date":1569915384,"last_edit_date":1569921025,"question_id":58180062,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58180062","body_markdown":"I want to test componentDidUpdate \r\nI tried passing {...props} without defining it\r\nit then componentDidUpdate first logs an empty object and then update not required\r\nand this logs them twice and shows props is not defined\r\nHow can I test componentDidUpdate without ending into a loop.\r\n\r\nMy code \r\n````\r\ncomponentDidUpdate(updateRequired) {\r\n        console.log(this.props);\r\n        if (this.props.updateRequired === true) {\r\n            this.anotherFunc();\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log(&quot;update not required&quot;)\r\n        }    \r\n    }\r\n    anotherFunc() {\r\n            this.props.callBackFalse();\r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis is the code I want to test \r\n````\r\ncomponentDidUpdate(updateRequired) {\r\n        console.log(this.props);\r\n        if (this.props.updateRequired === true) {\r\n            this.anotherFunc();\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.log(&quot;update not required&quot;)\r\n        }    \r\n    }\r\n````\r\n\r\nI tried testing with setProps like this\r\n````\r\nit(&#39;checks if component updates on receiving props&#39;, async (done) =&gt;

creating a new surface and a new texture every frame. Yeah it&#39;s going to be slow, creating textures is a ridiculously slow operation. Don&#39;t do it so often.\r\n\r\nIf you need to write pixels directly, create a texture of the right size once (with `SDL_TEXTUREACCESS_STREAMING`) and then use `SDL_LockTexture` and `SDL_UnlockTexture` to update it (note: don&#39;t use `SDL_UpdateTexture` for this, it&#39;s not really much - if at all - better than recreating the texture performance wise). I&#39;m guessing the windows version is fast &quot;by accident&quot; because your driver implementation notices you&#39;re doing something strange and quietly ignores what you&#39;re telling it to do and does something faster.\r\n\r\nOf course without looking at the code it&#39;s hard to say this is the _only_ problem with it, but this is pretty likely to be a (or maybe even the) bottleneck.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180023/sdl2-sdl-pollevent-slower-on-ubuntu-mac-os-x-than-windows/58181660#58181660","title":"SDL2 - SDL_PollEvent slower on Ubuntu/Mac OS X than Windows"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":7556145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6576454e9d158fb6c0358750d6c992a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Francesco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7556145/francesco"},"last_editor":{"reputation":85,"user_id":7556145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6576454e9d158fb6c0358750d6c992a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Francesco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7556145/francesco"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571037946,"last_edit_date":1571037946,"creation_date":1571037511,"answer_id":58371783,"question_id":58180023,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58371783","body_markdown":"As I wrote before the problem is that **SDL_PollEvent function is slower on Ubuntu than on Windows**.\r\n\r\nThis has pointed my attention on main loop and I found a problem: *new events polling is done on each loop on main while cycle* instead of on each frame (60 times per seconds) so this heavily slowdown the execution. This is not a problem on Windows because there is a sufficient time for drawing a frame each 16 ms but it is a problem on Ubuntu where SDL_PollEvent is slower and the frame is drawn not in time.\r\n\r\nSo **I moved the polling handler in order to check for a user input only 60 times per second.

It is possible to eliminate the first one in the main loop but obviously not the second one. Why poll events is too slow?

is a hard question to answer, with a lot of different opinions, but I would say you are correct in splitting up your relationship into two separate models.\r\n\r\n However, there are several considerations to take into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n When looking at this from a database design perspective, there is hardly any reason to split up your database tables. Whenever there is a one-to-one relationship that is always there, you should merge it into one table. The amount of columns hardly matters, unless you are optimising your database. \r\n\r\n[An answer from this question sums up the actual physical reasons to split up a 1-to-1 relationship quite nicely:][1]\r\n\r\n&gt;  - You might want to cluster or partition the two &quot;endpoint&quot; tables of a 1:1 relationship differently.\r\n&gt;  - If your DBMS allows it, you might want to put them on different physical disks (e.g. more performance-critical on an SSD and the other\r\n&gt; on a cheap HDD).\r\n&gt;  - You have measured the effect on caching and you want to make sure the &quot;hot&quot; columns are kept in cache, without &quot;cold&quot; columns\r\n&gt; &quot;polluting&quot; it.\r\n&gt;  - You need a concurrency behavior (such as locking) that is &quot;narrower&quot; than the whole row. This is highly DBMS-specific.\r\n&gt;  - You need different security on different columns, but your DBMS does not support column-level permissions.\r\n&gt;  - Triggers are typically table-specific. While you can theoretically have just one table and have the trigger ignore the &quot;wrong half&quot; of\r\n&gt; the row, some databases may impose additional limits on what a trigger\r\n&gt; can and cannot do. For example, Oracle doesn&#39;t let you modify the so\r\n&gt; called &quot;mutating&quot; table from a row-level trigger - by having separate\r\n&gt; tables, only one of them may be mutating so you can still modify the\r\n&gt; other from your trigger (but there are other ways to work-around\r\n&gt; that).\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Databases are very good at manipulating the data, so I wouldn&#39;t split\r\n&gt; the table just for the update performance, *unless* you have performed\r\n&gt; the actual benchmarks on representative amounts of data and concluded\r\n&gt; the performance difference is actually there and significant enough\r\n&gt; (e.g. to offset the increased need for JOINing).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Django&#39;s standpoint  ##\r\n\r\nIf you look at the way Django is designed, there is some merit to splitting up your table into one-to-one relationships. [One of Django&#39;s design philosophies is &#39;Loose coupling&#39;][2]. Which in Django&#39;s ecosystem means that separate applications shouldn&#39;t have to know about each other to function properly. In you case, it could be argued that a Student model shouldn&#39;t have to know anything about it&#39;s IELTS tests, because if you separate those two, the Student model could be reused in some other application. \r\nAlso, some functionality that does some kind of analysis over IELTS tests, shouldn&#39;t have to &#39;know&#39; anything about the student that took this test.\r\n\r\nDo use this design pattern with some caution though. A good question to ask yourself would be not necessarily &quot;How may columns do I have in my model?&quot;, because sometimes there is a good reason to have a lot of data in one model. So answering yes to this question alone would not necessarily merit splitting up your tables. A better question to ask yourself would be &quot;Do I want to separate responsibilities/functionality of these two types of data?&quot;, which could be for any reason, like reusability or security.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9687980/why-use-a-1-to-1-relationship-in-database-design/9688442\r\n  [2]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/misc/design-philosophies/#loose-coupling","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58180005/should-i-divide-a-table-by-onetoonefield-if-the-number-of-columns-is-too-many/58180751#58180751","title":"Should I divide a table by OneToOneField if the number of columns is too many?"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":11065874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUe7Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amin Ba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11065874/amin-ba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":104,"user_id":11065874,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mUe7Z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amin Ba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11065874/amin-ba"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58180751,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569918163,"creation_date":1569915134,"last_edit_date":1569918163,"question_id":58180005,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58180005","body_markdown":"I have a student model that already has too many fields including the name, nationality, address, language, travel history, etc of the student.

You can also use [`getBoundingClientRect`][2] to get the full fractional value and other information about the element&#39;s dimensions on-page.\r\n\r\nLive Example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    for(var i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {\r\n        var elem = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);\r\n        elem.className = &quot;day_cell&quot;;\r\n        elem.id = &#39;p&#39;+i;\r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;day_scale&quot;).appendChild(elem);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(function() {\r\n        console.log(document.querySelector(&quot;.day_cell&quot;).clientWidth);\r\n    }, 100);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #day_scale {\r\n        position: absolute;\r\n        display: table;\r\n        width: 100%;\r\n        top: 50%;\r\n        table-layout: fixed;\r\n        border-spacing: 1px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n            \r\n    .day_cell {\r\n        display: table-cell;\r\n        background-color: #a9cce3;\r\n        padding: 3px;\r\n\r\n        box-sizing: border-box;\r\n        -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\r\n\r\n        border: 1px solid black;\r\n        border-radius: 2px;\r\n\r\n        overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;day_scale&quot;&gt;\r\n        \t\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe reason `.style.width` doesn&#39;t work is that it just returns the value of the `width` style within the element&#39;s inline `style` attribute (e.g., `&quot;50px&quot;` for `&lt;div style=&quot;width: 50px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;`), not the actual width of the element. If the element doesn&#39;t have an inline `style` attribute, or that inline style attribute doesn&#39;t have a `width` style, `.style.width` returns `&quot;&quot;`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/clientWidth\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/getBoundingClientRect","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179984/how-to-get-element-width-when-using-table-like-behaviour/58180081#58180081","title":"how to get element width when using table-like behaviour"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569916049,"last_edit_date":1569916049,"creation_date":1569915646,"answer_id":58180134,"question_id":58179984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58180134","body_markdown":"You can use .clientWidth but perhaps also computedStyle is useful to you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var numElems = 10;\r\n\r\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; numElems; i++) {\r\n      var elem = document.createElement(&quot;div&quot;);\r\n      elem.className = &quot;day_cell&quot;;\r\n      elem.id = &#39;p&#39; + i;\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;day_scale&quot;).appendChild(elem);\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(\r\n      document.querySelector(&quot;.day_cell&quot;).clientWidth,\r\n      Math.round(\r\n        parseFloat(\r\n          window.getComputedStyle(document.querySelector(&quot;.day_cell&quot;)).width\r\n        )\r\n      ),\r\n      Math.round(\r\n        parseFloat(\r\n          window.getComputedStyle(document.getElementById(&quot;day_scale&quot;)).width\r\n        ) / numElems\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #day_scale {\r\n      position: absolute;\r\n      display: table;\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      top: 50%;\r\n      table-layout: fixed;\r\n      border-spacing: 1px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .day_cell {\r\n      display: table-cell;\r\n      background-color: #a9cce3;\r\n      padding: 3px;\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n      -moz-box-sizing: border-box;\r\n      border: 1px solid black;\r\n      border-radius: 2px;\r\n      overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;day_scale&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179984/how-to-get-element-width-when-using-table-like-behaviour/58180134#58180134","title":"how to get element width when using table-like behaviour"}],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":9266158,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3dafe85c77f0eedfa947438009a4754?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AndSolomin34","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9266158/andsolomin34"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58180081,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569916049,"creation_date":1569915049,"question_id":58179984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58179984","body_markdown":"I had to put multiple divs in a line (horizontally) inside another div.

So, if you commit the pipelines configuration file to master, only `default` or `master` pipeline from this file will be executed. If you want to run a pipeline for `develop` branch, you need to commit this file to develop branch as well. Note, that the `default` pipeline is executed regardless of the branch name if there is no other pipeline defined for this particular branch. So, your comment is correct, you need to have the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` in each branch.\r\n\r\nHere is how Bitbucket will resolve the pipeline execution configuration^\r\n\r\n 1. If there is no `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` - no pipelines will run for the branch\r\n\r\n 2.

The reason for that is because, otherwise, if the C app wanted to use another D library which had among its dependencies some package that&#39;s also a dependency in your library, and if it were linked in the same way (including all of its dependencies in its static library file), this dependency would then occur twice in the linker inputs.
