Clear as mud?\r\n\r\nSo, my python script is in a DOS shell (cmd.exe), and I run it from there, and it uses subprocess.Popen to spawn a .bat script that I do not own and cannot modify. It in turn spawns a new DOS shell (cmd.exe), and this is where I run into trouble.\r\n\r\nI can talk to stdin/stdout on the .bat script that I am running, but once it executes its DOS shell, I see none of that output. I am guessing that file descriptors are not inherited in the same way on Windows as they are on Unix, and I am looking for good solutions to this problem.

good approach to solve this would be inserting a unique identifier on each element, which would result in a strong bond among your data set.  \r\n  \r\nSince you said that it&#39;s not possible to do, you can use ag-grid generated ID which will also serve as an index to your data.\r\n\r\n&gt; As [ag-grid documentation][1] says:   \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; &gt; The easiest way to get a rowNode is by its ID. The ID is either\r\n&gt; &gt; provided by you using the grid callback getRowNodeId(), or generated\r\n&gt; &gt; by the grid using an internal sequence.\r\n\r\nSo in your case, one of the solutions would be using `getDisplayedRowAtIndex` method. On your second example, after data is sorted, you could do:\r\n\r\n    this.gridApi.getDisplayedRowAtIndex(0).id\r\n    // where 0 is your rowIndex\r\nand this would result in the value `3` as you expected. Basically, for each node you access it will have an `id` property and it will serve as an index on the original array.  \r\nDepending on your application you could also use `forEachNode` method that as documentation describes:\r\n\r\n&gt; Iterates through each node (row) in the grid and calls the callback\r\n&gt; for each node.

I read through the section on it (most of the tutorial really) on cplusplus.com (but I clearly have to re-read some sections). Still, I tried some practical examples and encountered some frustrating situations.\r\n\r\n1. I created a simple function, `void Log(std::string message) {std::cout &lt;&lt; message &lt;&lt; std::endl;}`, and that works great until I try to use it with `char*` in combination with `string`. For example, if I have `std::string a` and `char* b`, I cannot do `Log(a + b)`, but I _can_ do `std::string print = “”; print += a; print += b; Log(print);` Why? How should I define my `Log(.)` function so that I can use it similarly to `Log(a+b)` regardless of what types they are (at least `std::string` and `char*`, but preferably also `int` and other types)? If that’s possible, at least.\r\n2. When I do `char * a = “some text”;`, I get the warning `conversion from string literal to ‘char *’ is deprecated`. Obviously, this is not good, so why is this happening and how should I avoid this?\r\n3. Under which circumstances should I prefer one over the other (apart from the obvious that I sometimes am forced because of some API’s, etc)? Is it a good practice, for example, to convert all my `char *` to `string` or vice-versa?\r\n\r\nIn general, my knowledge of `char *` and `strings` (and C++ in general) has… room for improvement, so feel free to give some sources for how to get more familiar and comfortable with `char *`, `strings`, and any other related types (`arrays`, etc?). Although, I would very much appreciate it if someone would explain to me the two particular points above, as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961877/how-do-i-use-char-and-stdstring-interchangeably-as-well-as-in-combination","title":"How do I use char* and std::string, interchangeably as well as in combination?"},{"tags":["angular","asp.net-core-webapi","asp.net-core-signalr"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":595,"user_id":2307174,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Li2Lj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rohith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2307174/rohith"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568817273,"post_id":57986777,"comment_id":102396948,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961871/signalrcore-unable-to-get-updated-data-using-timer-manager/57986777#comment102396948_57986777"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10989,"user_id":6751634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kjSAI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fei Han","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6751634/fei-han"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568789971,"creation_date":1568789971,"answer_id":57986777,"question_id":57961871,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57986777","body_markdown":"&gt;When I tried to fetch the data from database I am getting the data, but when I do an updated in the database, the update is not reflecting in the resultant json I am getting.\r\n\r\n&gt;`var timerManager = new TimerManager(() =&gt; _hub.Clients.All.SendAsync(&quot;transferalertdata&quot;, res));`\r\n\r\nIn your `AlertsController`, we can find that you retrieve the data only one time when it reached into `Get` action, and you assign it to variable `res`, then in `TimerManager` callback function, you just send retrieved/old data to all connected SignalR clients, not fetching data with updates from database again, so the connected SignalR clients just received old data even though the callback function you provided is executed every two seconds. \r\n\r\nBesides, if you perform database query in code logic of callback function (or scheduled task), please note that it would be executed frequently (every two seconds), which may cause bad impact on your database server.

When you press the buttom the code in the method will run.\r\n\r\nTo avoid activating/deactivating all this buttons one by one, you can attach them to a panel(UI element) and activate/deactivate the panel istead. So, lets say you have 3 panels.\r\n\r\nThe Main menu panel, the Chapters panel and the Options panel.\r\n\r\nWhen the player wants to see the chapters, you diactivate the main menu panel and activate the chapters panel. To make this feel really polished you can add transition animations later on.\r\n\r\nThis is how i handle my UI without never changing scenes. It gives a really smooth and polished feel to the user.\r\n\r\nIf you have more quastions about UI, plz watch this [turtorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RIsfVOqTaE), it helped me a lot to understand the basics.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961863/how-to-change-menuitems-in-unity-in-one-scene/57963057#57963057","title":"How to Change MenuItems in Unity in One

Here are a few options that I can think of:\r\n\r\n - You can use the [`expr`][2] method option and create your own [custom rules][3] with that. This is probably the only &quot;real&quot; way to get what you want, but it&#39;s the most complicated option.\r\n\r\n - You could also use two windows in a tab, each pointing at the same buffer, and set different fold methods locally for each split.\r\n\r\n - Finally, you could always hack something together with autocommands. From the Vim wiki page [on folding][4], about having both indent and manual folding:\r\n\r\n    ```vim\r\n    augroup vimrc\r\n      au BufReadPre * setlocal foldmethod=indent\r\n      au BufWinEnter * if &amp;fdm == &#39;indent&#39; | setlocal foldmethod=manual | endif\r\n    augroup END\r\n    ```\r\nThis hack takes advantage of [modelines][5], and Vim&#39;s behavior for setting variables before vs. after the modeline is read. Note that you have to have Vim&#39;s `nocompatible` option set for this sort of trick to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/fold.html#fold-methods\r\n  [2]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/eval.html#expr\r\n  [3]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#&#39;foldexpr&#39;\r\n  [4]: https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding\r\n  [5]: http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#&#39;modeline&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961859/how-can-i-have-both-markdown-header-folding-and-indent-folding-in-vim/57994594#57994594","title":"How can I have *both* Markdown header folding and indent folding in Vim"}],"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":4096929,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16de8554bd4d2ec03c1c009935ea61c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dietrich Ayala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4096929/dietrich-ayala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568815325,"creation_date":1568655500,"question_id":57961859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961859","body_markdown":"Vim now has built-in Markdown folding, yay!\r\n\r\nI want to fold on Markdown headers, and within headers, fold on indents also.\r\n\r\nHow can I have *both* Markdown header folding + indent fold method at the same time?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961859/how-can-i-have-both-markdown-header-folding-and-indent-folding-in-vim","title":"How can I have *both* Markdown header folding and indent folding in Vim"},{"tags":["python","botframework"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3553,"user_id":2122672,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/602458008/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kyle Delaney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2122672/kyle-delaney"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568738706,"post_id":57961856,"comment_id":102366810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961856/create-python-proactive-messaging-with-microsoft-bot-framework#comment102366810_57961856"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1284,"user_id":10189459,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/998ed02eec37b40de6f7205c65a7d8ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stanley Gong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10189459/stanley-gong"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568875736,"creation_date":1568875736,"answer_id":58005220,"question_id":57961856,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58005220","body_markdown":"I worked a sample demo which based on [state management sample][1] for you .\r\nPls follow the setps to make it work : \r\n1.Adding code below into `app.py` : \r\n\r\n    @APP.route(&quot;/api/notify&quot;, methods=[&quot;POST&quot;])\r\n    def notify():\r\n        if request.headers[&quot;Content-Type&quot;] == &quot;application/json&quot;:\r\n            body = request.json\r\n        else:\r\n            return Response(status=415)\r\n        \r\n        activity = Activity().deserialize(body)\r\n        \r\n        auth_header = (\r\n            request.headers[&quot;Authorization&quot;] if &quot;Authorization&quot; in request.headers else &quot;&quot;\r\n        )\r\n        \r\n        async def aux_func(turn_context):\r\n            await BOT.on_turn(turn_context)\r\n    \r\n        try:\r\n            task = LOOP.create_task(\r\n                ADAPTER.process_activity(activity, auth_header, aux_func)\r\n            )\r\n            LOOP.run_until_complete(task)\r\n            return Response(status=201)\r\n        except Exception as exception:\r\n            raise exception\r\n\r\n2.Modify function `on_message_activity` in `state_management_bot.py` as code below\r\n\r\n    async def on_message_activity(self, turn_context: TurnContext):\r\n        # Get the state properties from the turn context.\r\n    \r\n        if(turn_context.activity.channel_id != &#39;notify&#39;):\r\n           await turn_context.send_activity(&quot;You asid:&quot; + turn_context.activity.text);\r\n        else:\r\n           await turn_context.send_activity(&quot;You get a notify : &quot;+ turn_context.activity.text);\r\n\r\n3.

This package is not on `pub.dev` so you need to install it via github.\r\n\r\nYou can install it as following\r\n\r\n    pimp_my_button:\r\n    git:\r\n      url: git://github.com/Norbert515/pimp_my_button.git\r\n\r\nAfter that you need to implement the button as following\r\n\r\n    PimpedButton(\r\n        particle: DemoParticle(),\r\n        pimpedWidgetBuilder: (context, controller) {\r\n          return FloatingActionButton(onPressed: () {\r\n              controller.forward(from: 0.0);\r\n          },);\r\n         },\r\n    ),\r\n\r\nYou can test it and you can see you have this fireworks effect on you button. \r\n\r\nNow to create a custom animation you have to create your own particle animation.\r\nI am attaching a simple bubble animation below you can tweak it to your need.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass MyParticle extends Particle {\r\n  @override\r\n  void paint(Canvas canvas, Size size, progress, seed) {\r\n    int randomMirrorOffset = 6;\r\n    CompositeParticle(children: [\r\n      // Firework(),\r\n      CircleMirror(\r\n          numberOfParticles: 16,\r\n          child: AnimatedPositionedParticle(\r\n            begin: Offset(0.0, 20.0),\r\n            end: Offset(0.0, 60.0),\r\n            child: FadingCircle(radius: 3.0, color: Colors.pink),\r\n          ),\r\n          initialRotation: -pi / randomMirrorOffset),\r\n      CircleMirror.builder(\r\n          numberOfParticles: 16,\r\n          particleBuilder: (index) {\r\n            return IntervalParticle(\r\n                child: AnimatedPositionedParticle(\r\n                  begin: Offset(0.0, 30.0),\r\n                  end: Offset(0.0, 50.0),\r\n                  child: FadingCircle(radius: 3.0, color: Colors.pink),\r\n                ),\r\n                interval: Interval(\r\n                  0.5,\r\n                  1,\r\n                ));\r\n          },\r\n          initialRotation: -pi / randomMirrorOffset ),\r\n    ]).paint(canvas, size, progress, seed);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nNow replace the `DemoParticle()` with `MyParticle()` &amp; you will have a bubble ripple effect.\r\n\r\nTo keep repeating the bubble animation, do following.\r\nChange \r\n\r\n&gt; controller.forward(from: 0.0); \r\n\r\nto \r\n&gt; controller.repeat(period: Duration(seconds: 1));\r\n\r\nHere you can change or skip the animation duration using period property.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961852/bubble-ripple-animation-in-flutter/57988051#57988051","title":"Bubble ripple animation in flutter"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12000053,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-R1HPzFOM4IY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcEBsrJY2irGeFCu9afRNdrCD2oUg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ram sham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000053/ram-sham"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4205,"user_id":3682162,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100004313019228/picture?type=large","display_name":"Vikrant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3682162/vikrant"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568794459,"creation_date":1568655468,"last_edit_date":1568698907,"question_id":57961852,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961852","body_markdown":"Bubble effect animation on tap:\r\n\r\n![Bubble effect animation on tap ][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vZeCP.png\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest me, how can I make this bubble effect animation using the flutter app?  \r\nA rough idea will be appreciated","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961852/bubble-ripple-animation-in-flutter","title":"Bubble ripple animation in flutter"},{"tags":["oracle","visual-studio","view","materialized-views","odac"],"owner":{"reputation":1138,"user_id":1399272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FoRYg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bondolin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1399272/bondolin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568655456,"creation_date":1568655456,"question_id":57961850,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961850","body_markdown":"Trying to create a Materialized View in Oracle Data Access Components for Visual Studio.

a difference between string literals (which require escaping) and string values from other places (like html, ajax, etc), which are what they look like. Only when converted to literals (ex: JSON.stringify, some console views, etc) do JS strings have backslash escaping. The escape is an output formatting artifact; internally, there are no escapes in the sequence of characters.\r\n\r\nHTML doesn&#39;t need the same escaping on blackslashes, due to different roots of the standard. An attribute isn&#39;t &quot;converted&quot; to one with escaped backslashes unless it&#39;s formatted as a string literal. That would happen at a stage between the string and it&#39;s visible output. You can use alert() instead of console.log() to see the string as it really is.

Question explanation:**\r\nThis question is not a duplicate of [this one][1] because I am trying to submit the image via a lambda function not straight to S3. I have to go through lambda to verify the user and permissions as well as make DB calls to find out where the data should be stored and to update the DB on the data location.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am trying to use Lambda to put a binary image into S3. The image gets posted to an API gateway endpoint and proxied to the lambda function. The function successfully puts the data into an S3 object, but when I download and read the object (via console) it is always corrupted, sometimes smaller than the input object, and unable to be opened.\r\n\r\nI think corruption has something to do with the `multipart/form-data` and something potentially being added onto the file/encoding the file, but I can&#39;t exactly figure out how to extract the image data directly.\r\n\r\nHow do I properly put the `multipart/form-data` image into S3?\r\n\r\n**React Native code to post to lambda**\r\n\r\n    const body = new FormData();\r\n    body.append(&#39;photo&#39;, {\r\n      uri: image.image,\r\n      name: image.name,\r\n      type: image.type,\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    fetch(&#39;https://ov2eat1o5h.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/uploadImage&#39;, {\r\n      method: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n      headers: {\r\n        Authorization: token,\r\n        &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;multipart/form-data&#39;,\r\n      },\r\n      body,\r\n    })\r\n      .then(response =&gt;

Here is an app that uses a small table to filter a larger one using `inner_join`. I am not sure this will match the design you had in mind. It is still unclear to me where the filter levels are coming from, or what the hands on tables are for. But you should be able to adapt this approach to your design. Note also that I am not using hands on tables. A direct replacement of the calls to `renderTable` with `renderRHandsontable` should work too.\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(shiny)\r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(purrr)\r\n\r\nsub_cars &lt;- mtcars[, c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;gear&quot;, &quot;am&quot;)]\r\n\r\nui &lt;- fluidPage(\r\n  column(width=3,\r\n         selectInput(\r\n    inputId = &quot;sel_col&quot;,\r\n    label = &quot;Select variables&quot;,\r\n    multiple = TRUE,\r\n    choices = c(&quot;cyl&quot;, &quot;gear&quot;, &quot;am&quot;),\r\n    selectize = TRUE),\r\n    uiOutput(&quot;cyl&quot;),\r\n    uiOutput(&quot;gear&quot;),\r\n    uiOutput(&quot;am&quot;)\r\n    ),\r\n  column(width = 3, \r\n         tableOutput(&quot;filter_table&quot;)),\r\n  column(width = 6,\r\n         tableOutput(&quot;large_table&quot;))\r\n  \r\n)\r\n\r\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\r\n  output$cyl &lt;- renderUI({\r\n    if (&quot;cyl&quot; %in% input$sel_col) {\r\n      selectInput(\r\n        inputId = &quot;sel_cyl&quot;,\r\n        label = &quot;Select cylinders&quot;,\r\n        choices = unique(sub_cars$cyl),\r\n        multiple = TRUE,\r\n        selectize = TRUE\r\n      )\r\n    }\r\n  })    \r\n    output$gear &lt;- renderUI({\r\n      if (&quot;gear&quot; %in% input$sel_col) {\r\n        selectInput(\r\n          inputId = &quot;sel_gear&quot;,\r\n          label = &quot;Select gears&quot;,\r\n          choices = unique(sub_cars$gear),\r\n          multiple = TRUE,\r\n          selectize = TRUE\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n    output$am &lt;- renderUI({\r\n      if (&quot;am&quot; %in% input$sel_col) {\r\n        selectInput(\r\n          inputId = &quot;sel_am&quot;,\r\n          label = &quot;Select am&quot;,\r\n          choices = unique(sub_cars$am),\r\n          multiple = TRUE,\r\n          selectize = TRUE\r\n        )\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    # make a small filter table\r\n    filter_df &lt;- reactive({\r\n      validate(\r\n        need(!is_null(input$sel_col),\r\n             message = &quot;Please select a column&quot;))\r\n      cols &lt;- input$sel_col\r\n      cols_vals &lt;- map(cols, function(x) input[[paste0(&quot;sel_&quot;, x, collapse=&quot;&quot;)]])\r\n      \r\n      df &lt;- map2_dfr(cols, cols_vals, function(x, y)\r\n        filter(sub_cars,!!as.name(x) %in% y)) %&gt;% \r\n        select(one_of(cols)) %&gt;% \r\n        distinct()\r\n      \r\n      return(df)\r\n    })\r\n    \r\n    output$filter_table &lt;- renderTable({\r\n      validate(\r\n        need(nrow(filter_df()) &gt; 0,\r\n             message = &quot;Please select filter values&quot;))\r\n      filter_df()\r\n      })\r\n    \r\n    # inner join the larger table\r\n    large_df &lt;- reactive({\r\n      validate(\r\n        need(nrow(filter_df()) &gt; 0,\r\n             message = &quot;Please select filter values&quot;))\r\n      cols &lt;- input$sel_col\r\n      inner_join(x=filter_df(), y=mtcars, by = cols)\r\n    })\r\n  \r\n    output$large_table &lt;- renderTable({large_df()})\r\n}\r\n\r\nshinyApp(ui, server)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a gif of what it does.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/imSxP.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961775/subset-a-dataframe-based-on-columns-of-another-dataframe-in-a-shiny-app/57982869#57982869","title":"Subset a dataframe based on columns of another dataframe in a shiny app"}],"owner":{"reputation":1195,"user_id":9198260,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b84f83633c7fe751a585e7f1efe0371e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"firmo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9198260/firmo23"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57982869,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568760365,"creation_date":1568655076,"question_id":57961775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961775","body_markdown":"I have the dataframe below:\r\n\r\n    DF2 = data.frame(agency_postcode = factor(rep(c(12345,45678,24124,32525,32325),2)),\r\n                     car_group=factor(rep(c(&quot;Microcar&quot;,&quot;City car&quot;,&quot;Supermini&quot;,&quot;Compact&quot;,&quot;SUV&quot;),2)),\r\n                     transmission=factor(rep(c(&quot;automatic&quot;,&quot;manual&quot;),5)))\r\n\r\nwhich I use and display as rhandsontable in order to create a second table.

of suggestions:\r\n\r\n### Avoid confusion\r\n\r\nPeople unfamiliar with currying often say the same thing: why do `add(1)(2)` when you can just do `add(1, 2)`? They&#39;re right. That example doesn&#39;t do justice to currying at all.\r\n\r\nIf your team is just about getting acquainted with functional programming, don&#39;t make it unnecessary confusing to them. If you can supply all arguments in one go, just do it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nisValidCode(doc, req); // not isValidCode(doc)(req);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Don&#39;t use Ramda for the sake of using Ramda\r\n\r\nThis: `R.equals(pathCode(req), pathCode(doc))` is the same as: `pathCode(req) === pathCode(doc)`.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to use Ramda, consider [`eqBy`][2] instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\neqBy(pathCode, req, code);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pointfree is not the only way\r\n\r\nIt certainly is an interesting way to write functions but it cannot be a goal. Say you need to check that `a` is equal to `&#39;foo&#39;` and `b` is equal to `&#39;bar&#39;`:\r\n\r\nIs this pointfree function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fn = useWith(and, [equals(&#39;foo&#39;), equals(&#39;bar&#39;)]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny better than this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fn = (a, b) =&gt; a === &#39;foo&#39; &amp;&amp; b === &#39;bar&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\n?\r\n\r\n### Is `all` correctly invoked?\r\n\r\nAccording to the doc, [`all`][1] takes a function and a list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nall(x =&gt; x === 42)([41, 42, 43]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless I&#39;m mistaken what you&#39;ve done is to invoke `all` with the result of each function call. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\nall(true, false, true, ...);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Avoid the `__` placeholder\r\n\r\n`gte(__, Date.now())` can be changed to `flip(gte)(Date.now())`\r\n\r\n### Be consistent\r\n\r\nIn one case you allow a path to be set to `undefined`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// true even for `{passwordRecovery: {code: undefined}}`\r\nhasPath([&#39;passwordRecovery&#39;, &#39;code&#39;], req);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas in the other you don&#39;t:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompose(R.complement(R.isNil), pathCode)(doc)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeing consistent would allow this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst notNil = complement(isNil);\r\nboth(pathSatisfies(notNil, pathCode), req, doc)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]:

So it consider that your variable name is `corr_k` and not `corr_0` and so on as you would like. Which is hopeful, think about the nightmare it would be if python changed all `k` character on its own! So, to specify a variable name which changes with the loop index, use a dictionary (as in [this answer][1]) and store the lists in it:\r\n\r\n    corr = {}\r\n     for k in range(4):\r\n          corr[k] = np.corrcoef ( T[(365-k):(730-k)] ,T[365:730] ) \r\n\r\nThen you will have your outputs with: `corr[0]`, `corr[1]`, `corr[2]`, `corr[3]`.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to test your code as we do not have `T` here, but as a first insight I see that for each step your are defining again `corr_k=[]`, hence overwriting your list rather than appending it. Try:\r\n\r\n    corr_k= [] \r\n    for k in range(4):\r\n          corr_k.append( np.corrcoef ( T[(365-k):(730-k)] ,T[365:730]) )\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6181935/how-do-you-create-different-variable-names-while-in-a-loop\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961706/how-to-append-more-than-one-list-of-time-series-correlation-in-python/57964003#57964003","title":"how to append more than one list of time series correlation in python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11853599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aeb8c3e3b718bf31b77b0ab0cf5b32b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ruby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11853599/ruby"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11853599,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aeb8c3e3b718bf31b77b0ab0cf5b32b9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ruby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11853599/ruby"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568750102,"creation_date":1568654776,"last_edit_date":1568702084,"question_id":57961706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961706","body_markdown":"I want to take correlation between two time series.

The comment below by Hans Passant helps best.  First I will transfer this project to Visual Studio and go from there to find the right libraries to link this to.  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961704/windows-sdk-issue-linking-64-bit-exe-on-windows-7","title":"Windows SDK issue linking 64-bit exe on Windows 7"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","ruby-on-rails","pdf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7526,"user_id":2491227,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad5c1442bc53ce0e90950a8cabc35295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kevin Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2491227/kevin-brown"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663078,"post_id":57961700,"comment_id":102338010,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961700/disable-links-inside-pdf-embedded-on-embed-tag#comment102338010_57961700"},{"owner":{"reputation":2985,"user_id":4254700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5225a3969314fb32ff3192e48c752c1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"joelgeraci","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4254700/joelgeraci"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7526,"user_id":2491227,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ad5c1442bc53ce0e90950a8cabc35295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kevin Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2491227/kevin-brown"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568663992,"post_id":57961700,"comment_id":102338378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961700/disable-links-inside-pdf-embedded-on-embed-tag#comment102338378_57961700"}],"owner":{"reputation":699,"user_id":3201684,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fce047896b7ee0a2f6967156e339521f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ntonnelier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3201684/ntonnelier"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568654753,"creation_date":1568654753,"question_id":57961700,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961700","body_markdown":"On my app users can upload a `pdf` file and render it directly in the browser:\r\n\r\n    &lt;embed src=&quot;some.pdf&quot; id=&quot;pdf-embed&quot; type=&quot;application/pdf&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nNow I want to disable all links inside the `pdf` for which have been googling for a while but cannot find a simple solution.\r\n\r\nI tried the following:\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;#pdf-embed&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, function(e) {\r\n      e.preventDefault();\r\n    })\r\n\r\nBut doesn&#39;t not work, since `#pdf-embed` does not have html content but a source `pdf` (rendered by some `js` classes from the browser).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961700/disable-links-inside-pdf-embedded-on-embed-tag","title":"disable links inside pdf embedded on &lt;embed&gt; tag"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","pandas-groupby"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24785,"user_id":4333359,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/231e42e97a07b2937c1bf8a313dfa3f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ALollz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333359/alollz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568654850,"post_id":57961699,"comment_id":102334953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961699/ordering-groupby-by-max-values-with-results-limit#comment102334953_57961699"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":8526181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/882b74062a4f79d31d8920325eb9d722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gabriel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8526181/gabriel"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568654830,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568654743,"creation_date":1568654743,"question_id":57961699,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961699","body_markdown":"I have this code:\r\n\r\n    words = data.groupby([&#39;subid2&#39;,&#39;keyword&#39;]).agg(\r\n         total_clicks = pd.NamedAgg(&#39;clicks&#39;, &#39;sum&#39;),\r\n         total_revenue = pd.NamedAgg(&#39;revenue&#39;, &#39;sum&#39;)\r\n    )\r\n    words[&#39;avg_cpc&#39;] = words[&#39;total_revenue&#39;] / words[&#39;total_clicks&#39;]\r\n    print(words)\r\n\r\nWhich is working as expected but after printing that, I also want to print again the results, ordering by average_cpc starting from highest and limiting for example to only show the 10 &quot;keyword&quot; FOR EACH &quot;subid2&quot; with highest average_cpc.

Would want the output to look like.\r\n\r\n```\r\n------------------------\r\n| Year | Month | Total |\r\n------------------------\r\n| 2016 |  Aug  |   2   |\r\n| 2018 |  May  |   3   |\r\n| 2019 |  Aug  |   2   |\r\n------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I know I had two workers working in August 2016 and three in May 2018.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961694/sql-query-extract-totals-by-month-for-multiple-date-fields","title":"SQL Query Extract Totals by Month for Multiple Date Fields"},{"tags":["javascript","firebase","google-cloud-firestore","document","id"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":2705832,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4b7fcb6a9a505ddd1b32f0e2109ed2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zulfadhli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705832/zulfadhli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568713047,"post_id":57962925,"comment_id":102352978,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961693/how-to-get-a-firestore-document-id-based-on-its-content/57962925#comment102352978_57962925"},{"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":11672166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be83fb6d2f6554cc268dd0466d6fdf66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JKleinne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11672166/jkleinne"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":2705832,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4b7fcb6a9a505ddd1b32f0e2109ed2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zulfadhli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705832/zulfadhli"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568748163,"post_id":57962925,"comment_id":102370739,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961693/how-to-get-a-firestore-document-id-based-on-its-content/57962925#comment102370739_57962925"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":11672166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be83fb6d2f6554cc268dd0466d6fdf66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JKleinne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11672166/jkleinne"},"last_editor":{"reputation":580,"user_id":11672166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be83fb6d2f6554cc268dd0466d6fdf66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JKleinne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11672166/jkleinne"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568718535,"last_edit_date":1568718535,"creation_date":1568660446,"answer_id":57962925,"question_id":57961693,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57962925","body_markdown":"Firebase Cloud Firestore allows you to [perform simple and compounded queries](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/get-data). Essentially, you can provide a condition in the `db.collection(&lt;COLLECTION&gt;).where()` clause which will filter all documents that match that certain condition.\r\n\r\nFor illustrative purposes, suppose documents in the `a` collection follow the following structure: `{ id, &#39;123&#39;, name: &#39;test&#39;, color: &#39;red&#39; }`. If you want to get all documents with the color red, you can simply call `db.collection(&#39;a&#39;).where(&#39;color&#39;, &#39;==&#39;, &#39;red&#39;)`, which you can then iterate into to process each document that matches that condition.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in your specific case, suppose your document structure is `{ id, content }`you can try something like this:\r\n```js\r\nvar deleteContent = document.getElementById(&#39;delete&#39;);\r\ndeleteContent.addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, function(e) {\r\n    // get current document ID\r\n    let docToDelete = db.collection(&quot;checkin&quot;).where(&#39;content&#39;, &#39;==&#39;, &#39;CONTENT_GOES_HERE&#39;)\r\n\r\n    x = docToDelete.id;\r\n    var getId = db.collection(&quot;checkin&quot;).doc(x);\r\n\r\n    getId.delete().then(function() {\r\n        console.log(&quot; successfully deleted!&quot;);\r\n    }).catch(function(error) {\r\n        console.error(&quot;Error removing document: &quot;, error);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, a much simpler way would be to store the document id somewhere within your application whenever a specific document is read, local storage or session storage for instance. As such, you can refer to the document id whenever you need. For example, suppose that you fetch all of a user&#39;s documents in an onLoad event handler --- suppose that you have HTML elements with the id &#39;content1&#39;, &#39;content2&#39;, &#39;content3&#39;, etc. and that it is where the contents of your documents are shown. You can try something like this: \r\n```js\r\nlet userId = 123;\r\n\r\n[...].onload = () =&gt; {\r\n  // Get all of the documents belonging to this user\r\n  let i = 0;\r\n  let docs = [];\r\n  let documents = db.collection(&#39;posts&#39;).where(&#39;userId&#39;, &#39;==&#39;, userId);\r\n  documents.forEach(doc =&gt; {\r\n    document.getElementById(`content${i}`).innerHTML = JSON.stringify(doc.data()); // Just stringifying to be certain\r\n    /**\r\n     * Extra step to add the document id in the sessionStorage so that we can refer to it later\r\n     */\r\n     htmlId = &#39;content&#39; + i;\r\n     sessionStorage.setItem(htmlID, doc.id );\r\n  })\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn doing so, you can simply refer to the document id like such `sessionStorage.getItem(&#39;content2&#39;)`. \r\n\r\nNote that in any of the examples I listed, there is heavy preparation that needs to be done in order for this to be as smooth sailing as possible. However, wouldn&#39;t you agree that a programmer merely is a person that spends hours on things that takes minutes for the sake of making it easier in subsequent uses? :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57961693/how-to-get-a-firestore-document-id-based-on-its-content/57962925#57962925","title":"How to get a Firestore document ID based on its content?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":2705832,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc4b7fcb6a9a505ddd1b32f0e2109ed2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zulfadhli","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2705832/zulfadhli"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11093,"user_id":4604701,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d8cb75b7c39263de208e368e72ad3ad1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fubar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4604701/fubar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57962925,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568718535,"creation_date":1568654708,"last_edit_date":1568673110,"question_id":57961693,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57961693","body_markdown":"I am trying to get a way to delete firestore document by a click event. \r\n\r\nhere is what i have so far. `x` is the document id i get from firestore.
