When this happens, any data entered into a form is lost, since it doesn&#39;t reach the HttpPost endpoint. Instead, the request is redirected to the same URI with a GET, following the signin-oidc redirect. Is this a limitation, or do I have something configured incorrectly?\r\n\r\nI noticed this issue after shortening the AccessTokenLifetime with the intent of forcing the user&#39;s claims to be renewed more frequently (i.e. if the user were disabled or they had claims revoked). I have only reproduced this when the OpenIdConnect middleware&#39;s OpenIdConnectionOptions are set to true `options.UseTokenLifetime = true;` (setting this to false results in the authenticated user&#39;s claims not being updated as expected).\r\n\r\nI was able to recreate and demonstrate this behavior using the IdentityServer4 sample quickstart [5_HybridFlowAuthenticationWithApiAccess][1] with the following changes below. Basically, there is an authorized form that has an HttpGet and an HttpPost method. If you wait longer than the AccessTokenLifetime (configured to only 30 seconds in this example) to submit the form, the HttpGet method is called instead of the HttpPost method.\r\n\r\nModifications to [MvcClient/Startup.cs][2]\r\n```\r\npublic void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n{\r\n\tservices.AddMvc();\r\n\r\n\tJwtSecurityTokenHandler.DefaultInboundClaimTypeMap.Clear();\r\n\r\n\tservices.AddAuthentication(options =&gt;\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\toptions.DefaultScheme = &quot;Cookies&quot;;\r\n\t\t\toptions.DefaultChallengeScheme = &quot;oidc&quot;;\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t\t.AddCookie(&quot;Cookies&quot;, options =&gt;\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t// the following was added\r\n\t\t\toptions.SlidingExpiration = false;\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t\t.AddOpenIdConnect(&quot;oidc&quot;, options =&gt;\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\toptions.SignInScheme = &quot;Cookies&quot;;\r\n\r\n\t\t\toptions.Authority = &quot;http://localhost:5000&quot;;\r\n\t\t\toptions.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;\r\n\r\n\t\t\toptions.ClientId = &quot;mvc&quot;;\r\n\t\t\toptions.ClientSecret = &quot;secret&quot;;\r\n\t\t\toptions.ResponseType = &quot;code id_token&quot;;\r\n\r\n\t\t\toptions.SaveTokens = true;\r\n\t\t\toptions.GetClaimsFromUserInfoEndpoint = true;\r\n\r\n\t\t\toptions.Scope.Add(&quot;openid&quot;);\r\n\t\t\toptions.Scope.Add(&quot;api1&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\toptions.ClaimActions.MapJsonKey(&quot;website&quot;, &quot;website&quot;);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// the following were changed\r\n\t\t\toptions.UseTokenLifetime = true;\r\n\t\t\toptions.Scope.Add(&quot;offline_access&quot;);\r\n\t\t});\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModifications to the Client list in [IdentityServer/Config.cs][3]\r\n```\r\nnew Client\r\n{\r\n\tClientId = &quot;mvc&quot;,\r\n\tClientName = &quot;MVC Client&quot;,\r\n\tAllowedGrantTypes = GrantTypes.Hybrid,\r\n\r\n\tClientSecrets =\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tnew Secret(&quot;secret&quot;.Sha256())\r\n\t},\r\n\r\n\tRedirectUris           = { &quot;http://localhost:5002/signin-oidc&quot;

I can see that execution goes chaotically from one function to another\r\n\r\nThis is normal if there are multiple threads running. While debugging, there is a &quot;Thread&quot; drop-down in the toolbar of Visual Studio. When you see it &quot;jump&quot; to another part of the code, notice that the thread number selected in that drop-down is different.\r\n\r\nBut this might suggest that multiple requests are being processed (i.e. you&#39;re actually sending 9 requests). You should be able to verify that on the client side (whatever the client is) or you can remove all your breakpoints, and set only one in your controller action:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; AddCompany(Company item)\r\n{\r\n    //set breakpoint here\r\n    var newcompany = await _companiesRepository.AddCompany(item);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen that breakpoint is hit, press F5. And just count how many times that breakpoint is hit.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re doing here:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic async Task&lt;Company&gt; AddCompany(Company item)\r\n{\r\n    var savedItem = await base.AddAsync(item);\r\n\r\n    var exist = Context.Companies.Find(savedItem.Id);\r\n    if (exist == null) return exist;\r\n\r\n    return savedItem;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the item was saved correctly, then `savedItem.Id` will have a value (assuming that is the primary key, generated by the database?). So why would you need to search for it to see if it&#39;s there? After all, if it didn&#39;t save successfully, there would have been an exception thrown.\r\n\r\nThen why would you return `exist` if it&#39;s `null`? Mind you, that would never happen for the same reason (if it didn&#39;t save, an exception would have been thrown and you would never get to that line of code).\r\n\r\nI feel like you could simplify that to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic Task&lt;Company&gt; AddCompany(Company item)\r\n{\r\n    return base.AddAsync(item);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that brings up another simplification (and minor performance enhancement) you can do: If you are going to return the result of the only `await` in your method, you can do away with `async` and `await` in that method and [just return the `Task`][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/19098209/1202807","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493197/weird-after-migration-to-ef-core-3-calling-async-context-sett-addt-create/58504374#58504374","title":"Weird!

This was working in an older version of MUI using a Modal but since getting on the latest that didn&#39;t work and I&#39;m trying to use a Popover. I tried to make a simple example on CodeSandox but that works. What happens is the Popover is always in the upper left of the page instead of the ListItem.\r\n\r\nI have simplified my code to a simple Button and Popover in the Dialog and still have the same problem and have ran out of ideas on what to try next. The error I get in the console is\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Warning] Material-UI: the `anchorEl` prop provided to the component is invalid.\r\nThe anchor element should be part of the document layout.\r\nMake sure the element is present in the document or that it&#39;s not display none.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the item is clicked I do event.currentTarget just like in the examples and this is what the console.log looks like for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Log] &lt;button class=&quot;MuiButtonBase-root MuiButton-root MuiButton-text&quot; tabindex=&quot;0&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt; (main.chunk.js, line 26437)\r\n&lt;span class=&quot;MuiButton-label&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;span class=&quot;MuiTouchRipple-root&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;span class=&quot;MuiTouchRipple-ripple MuiTouchRipple-rippleVisible&quot; style=&quot;width: 117.2006825918689px; height: 117.2006825918689px; top: -34.60034129593445px; left: -25.60034129593445px;&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;span class=&quot;MuiTouchRipple-child MuiTouchRipple-childLeaving&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI even tried doing disablePortal in the Dialog which didn&#39;t fix it.

The txt file.\r\nEach thread write the results at the end.\r\nI use mutex to write to this file.\r\n\r\nNow I have next solution:\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; k; k+=number_of_threads){\r\n    // create 4 threads\r\n    \r\n    // start function for each 4 threads\r\n\r\n    // join thread 1\r\n    // join thread 2\r\n    // join thread 3\r\n    // join thread 4\r\n    }\r\nThe problem is that new threads will not start until each thread ends.\r\nThis works. But there is a better solution, I think.\r\n\r\nHow can I start a new thread right after one of threads is finished?\r\nAnd I want to have only 4 running threads running at the same time(4 is the number of cores)\r\nI am using pthreads, by the way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493163/how-to-always-have-as-many-threads-running-simultaneously-as-the-number-of-cores","title":"How to always have as many threads running

Despite it being an `IDisposable` type it is not best practice to wrap it in a `using` statement and it&#39;s even ideal to make it a singleton.  However, what about when you pass in a `HttpClientHandler` to the constructor of the `HttpClient` like:\r\n```\r\nusing (var client = new HttpClient(singletonHttpClientHandler, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen code like above where the `HttpClient` is deliberately wrapped in a `using` statement but the `HttpClientHandler` is a singleton.  The docs indicate the client handler is disposed of unless the second param indicates `false` as is done above:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSee https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient?view=netframework-4.8#constructors\r\n\r\nPart of the problem with using HttpClient is several things like a timeout must be shared with all instances of that HttpClient, so for this reason it would be nice to create separate instances of HttpClient that use the same connection pool presumably provided by the HttpClientHandler (assuming that is how this works).  My concern is that I don&#39;t want HttpClient to create a connection pool that will then be disposed of each time.  There&#39;s multiple posts on how this is really bad for performance.  I can&#39;t seem to find any good documentation on effectively using HttpClient together with HttpClientHandlers.\r\n\r\nSo...  My question is basically:\r\n\r\n**When using an HttpClient &amp; HttpClientHandler together, is it best to make the HttpClientHandler a singleton and then instantiate as many new HttpClients in `using` blocks each time?** -- This again only makes sense if the connection pool is managed by the HttpClientHandler, which I think is the case.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxap9.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493140/what-are-the-best-practices-with-using-httpclient-httpclienthandler-for-multip","title":"What are the Best Practices with using HttpClient &amp; HttpClientHandler for multiple endpoints?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","list","tkinter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24719,"user_id":4001592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXDU3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Mesejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001592/daniel-mesejo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571687180,"post_id":58493133,"comment_id":103316246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493133/incrementing-count-inside-of-a-generator-or-other-solution#comment103316246_58493133"},{"owner":{"reputation":47918,"user_id":1467082,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZPeMR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David Zemens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1467082/david-zemens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571687332,"post_id":58493133,"comment_id":103316307,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493133/incrementing-count-inside-of-a-generator-or-other-solution#comment103316307_58493133"},{"owner":{"reputation":77038,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571688138,"post_id":58493133,"comment_id":103316605,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493133/incrementing-count-inside-of-a-generator-or-other-solution#comment103316605_58493133"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11206,"user_id":225020,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ae07ec5b34fce5a6c5437fbdab9f079?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jab","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/225020/jab"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571687763,"creation_date":1571687763,"answer_id":58493275,"question_id":58493133,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58493275","body_markdown":"You can use `zip` with the comprehension.\r\n\r\n    hwklist = [[student, entry.get()] for student, entry in zip(student_group_list, entries)]\r\n\r\nOr if you must use slice notation use `enumerate`:\r\n\r\n    hwklist = [[student, entries[i].get()] for i, student in enumerate(student_group_list)]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493133/incrementing-count-inside-of-a-generator-or-other-solution/58493275#58493275","title":"Incrementing count inside of a generator or other solution"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":3750257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KF8gx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pppery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3750257/pppery"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571687954,"creation_date":1571687954,"answer_id":58493312,"question_id":58493133,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58493312","body_markdown":"The `2dlist` function is overwriting `hwklist` with a new, independently created list for every execution of the loop.

When it was dotted in amongst the various functions it was hard to follow the flow of the program.\r\n\r\nDemo:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var pickWord = function(random) {\r\n      // Return a random word\r\n      return random[Math.floor(Math.random() * random.length)];\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    var setupAnswerArray = function(word) {\r\n      // Return the answer array\r\n      var answerArray = [];\r\n      for (i = 0; i &lt; word.length; i++) {\r\n        answerArray[i] = &quot;_&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(answerArray);\r\n      return answerArray;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    var getGuess = function() {\r\n      // Use prompt to get a guess\r\n      return (prompt(&quot;Guess a letter, or click Cancel to stop playing &quot; + answerArray)).toLowerCase();\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    var updateGameState = function(guess, word, answerArray) {\r\n      // Update answerArray and return a number showing how many\r\n      // times the guess appears in the word so remainingLetters\r\n      // can be updated\r\n      for (var j = 0; j &lt; word.length; j++) {\r\n        if (word[j] === guess &amp;&amp; answerArray[j] !== word[j]) {\r\n          answerArray[j] = guess;\r\n          remainingLetters--;\r\n        };\r\n      };\r\n      console.log(answerArray);\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    function play() {\r\n      var guess = getGuess();\r\n      console.log(guess);\r\n      updateGameState(guess, word, answerArray);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var word = pickWord([&quot;fakultet&quot;, &quot;zirafa&quot;, &quot;trava&quot;, &quot;labelo&quot;]);\r\n    console.log(word);\r\n    var answerArray = setupAnswerArray(word);\r\n    var remainingLetters = word.length;\r\n    while (remainingLetters &gt; 0) {\r\n      play();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    alert(&quot;You win - congratulations&quot;);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Section 2: JavaScript Language Basics&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Section 2: JavaScript Language Basics&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493131/why-is-my-function-not-looping-with-no-errors-showing/58493371#58493371","title":"Why is my function not looping with no errors showing?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10343028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c56708a262b1981536c48499dead51e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Antonio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10343028/antonio"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10343028,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c56708a262b1981536c48499dead51e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Antonio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10343028/antonio"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58493371,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571688879,"creation_date":1571687023,"last_edit_date":1571688879,"question_id":58493131,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493131","body_markdown":"I am following a book tutorial on Javascript, in which I should wite a hangman game using only functions, I am near the end but and I can&#39;t figure this one out...

you&#39;re trying to achieve is referred to as a subscription level deployment.  If you are trying to deploy this through a template via the portal I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re out of luck.  The deployment UI insists you specify a resource group to deploy in to which invalidates the API path routing when making the call to create your resource group.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this you&#39;ll need to use PowerShell or the Azure CLI.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with subscription level deployments is that you can&#39;t use the resourceGroup() function, so your template will need be

-Location &#39;West US&#39;```\r\n\r\nAzure CLI:\r\n\r\n```az deployment create --template-file &quot;&lt;path-to-template&gt;&quot; --location &quot;US West&quot;```\r\n\r\nYou will see a warning about upcoming breaking changes.  Microsoft are introducing a mandatory parameter ScopeType to the PowerShell, and scope-type to the CLI with four possible values - ResourceGroup, Subscription, ManagementGroup and Tenant.  In this instance, you would set ScopeType to Subscription, but you can see where Microsoft are going with the others.\r\n\r\nI expect the portal template deployment UI will be updated soon.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493127/azure-tagging-a-resource-group-using-an-arm-template/58493387#58493387","title":"Azure tagging a resource group using an ARM template"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11600109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q1ahqTjBsRs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdZm1Rb-GrXXpXwr0KMyAD1LbAFdg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitalii Fedorenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11600109/vitalii-fedorenko"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11600109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-q1ahqTjBsRs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdZm1Rb-GrXXpXwr0KMyAD1LbAFdg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitalii Fedorenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11600109/vitalii-fedorenko"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571777626,"creation_date":1571686999,"last_edit_date":1571773233,"question_id":58493127,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493127","body_markdown":"How I can tagging a Azure resource group using an ARM template and use Azure DevOps task Azure Deployment: Create Or Update Resource Group.

I will use Lodash functionality instead of vanilla JavaScript just to demonstrate how it can work:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function getFirst(item, paths) {\r\n      const notFound = Symbol(&quot;not found&quot;);\r\n      \r\n      return _(paths)\r\n        .map(path =&gt; _.get(item, path, notFound))\r\n        .filter(result =&gt; result !== notFound)\r\n        .first();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const obj = {\r\n      a: {\r\n        b: {\r\n          c: 42\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      x: {\r\n        y: 1\r\n      },\r\n      z: 2\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    console.log(getFirst(obj, [&#39;g&#39;]));\r\n    console.log(getFirst(obj, [&#39;g&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]));\r\n    console.log(getFirst(obj, [&#39;g&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;a.b.c&#39;, &#39;z&#39;]));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lodash@4.17.15/lodash.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n[Chaining](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#lodash) using Lodash is lazily evaluated, so the sequence is map first path to `_.get(item, path)` and if it fails returns a unique `notFound` value. Then if the `notFound` is discarded the next value would be mapped. This continues until either there is a match or all the members of `paths` are exhausted and the value is `undefined`.

negation symbol means that the character cannot be anything within the specified class. Your regex is much more complicated than it needs to be and is therefore obfuscating what you really want.\r\n\r\nYou probably want something like this:\r\n\r\n`^PA-(\\d+)-(\\d+)_TY$`\r\n\r\n... which matches anything that starts with `PA-`, then includes two groups of numbers separated by a dash, then an underscore and the letters `TY`. If you want everything after the `PA` to be what you capture, but separated into the three groups, then it&#39;s a little more abstract:\r\n\r\n`^PA-(.+)-(.+)_(.+)$`\r\n\r\nThis matches:\r\n\r\n* `PA-`\r\n* a capture group of any characters\r\n* a dash\r\n* another capture group of any characters\r\n* an underscore\r\n* all the remaining characters until end-of-line\r\n\r\nCharacter classes `[...]` are saying match any single character in the list, so your first capture group `(([^-]+)-([^_]+))` is looking for anything that isn&#39;t a dash any number of times followed by a dash (which is fine) followed by anything that isn&#39;t an underscore (again fine). Having the extra set of parentheses around that creates another capture group (probably group 1 as it&#39;s the first parentheses reached by the regex engine)... that part is OK but probably makes interpreting the answer less intuitive in this case.\r\n\r\nIn the re-write however, your first capture group `(([-]+)-([_]+))` matches `[-]+`, which means &quot;one or more dashes&quot; followed by a dash, followed by any number of underscores followed by an underscore. Since your input does not have a dash immediately following `PA-`, the entire regex fails to find anything.\r\n\r\nPutting the `PA` inside embedded character classes is also making things complicated. The first part of your first one is looking for, well, I&#39;m not actually sure how `[^[PA]-]+` is interpreted in practice but I suspect it&#39;s something like &quot;not either a P or an A or a dash any number of times&quot;. The second one is looking for the opposite, I think. But you don&#39;t want any of that, you just want to start without anything other than the actual sequence of characters you care about, which is just `PA-`.\r\n\r\nUpdate: As per the clarifications in the comments on the original question, knowing you want fixed-size groups of digits, it would look like this:\r\n\r\n`^PA-(\\d{6})-(\\d{3})_TY$`\r\n\r\nThat captures `PA-`, then a 6-digit number, then a dash, then a 3-digit number, then `_TY`. The six digit number and 3 digit numbers will be in capture groups 1 and 2, respectively.\r\n\r\nIf the sizes of those numbers could ever change, then replace `{x}` with `+` to just capture numbers regardless of max length.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493113/regex-format-for-a-particular-match/58493281#58493281","title":"Regex format for a particular Match"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":4981383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f3994ee6712d0da2eab2ef3824b88d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"acus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4981383/acus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":45,"user_id":4981383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f3994ee6712d0da2eab2ef3824b88d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"acus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4981383/acus"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58493281,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571693317,"creation_date":1571686926,"last_edit_date":1571687740,"question_id":58493113,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493113","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a regex for the following format \r\n\r\n**PA-123456-067_TY**\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s always `PA`, followed by a dash, 6 digits, another dash, then 3 digits, and ends with `_TY`\r\n\r\nApparently, when I write this regex to match the above format it shows the output correctly\r\n\r\n    ^[^[PA]-]+-(([^-]+)-([^_]+))_([^.]+)\r\n\r\nwith all the **Negation symbols ^**\r\n\r\nThis does not work if I write the regex in the below format without negation symbols \r\n\r\n    [[PA]-]+-(([-]+)-([_]+))_([.]+)\r\n\r\nCan someone explain to me why is this so?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493113/regex-format-for-a-particular-match","title":"Regex format for a particular Match"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","stored-procedures","copy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4417,"user_id":1385774,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6z25x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"maSTAShuFu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1385774/mastashufu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571686992,"post_id":58493110,"comment_id":103316181,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493110/copy-sql-server-table-into-a-txt-file-before-delete-it-from-sql-server#comment103316181_58493110"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":327,"user_id":515113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yv6kw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mindan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/515113/mindan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571710637,"post_id":58493304,"comment_id":103322059,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493110/copy-sql-server-table-into-a-txt-file-before-delete-it-from-sql-server/58493304#comment103322059_58493304"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":2665972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/518133797/picture?type=large","display_name":"Olivier L&#243;pez Ch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2665972/olivier-l%c3%b3pez-ch"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":327,"user_id":515113,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yv6kw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mindan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/515113/mindan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571808368,"post_id":58493304,"comment_id":103358388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493110/copy-sql-server-table-into-a-txt-file-before-delete-it-from-sql-server/58493304#comment103358388_58493304"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":2665972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/518133797/picture?type=large","display_name":"Olivier L&#243;pez Ch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2665972/olivier-l%c3%b3pez-ch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33,"user_id":2665972,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/518133797/picture?type=large","display_name":"Olivier L&#243;pez Ch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2665972/olivier-l%c3%b3pez-ch"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571808330,"last_edit_date":1571808330,"creation_date":1571687922,"answer_id":58493304,"question_id":58493110,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58493304","body_markdown":"With SQLCMD you could use the following approach:\r\n\r\n 1.

I want to achieve parallelization by multiprocessing in order to increase the efficiency, but turns out ```Entrez``` prohibited me to do this for some reason.\r\n\r\nI have tried both Python&#39;s ```multiprocessing``` package and ```pathos.multiprocessing``` module. Both does not work, although giving me different error messages. Here is my code of using ```pathos.multiprocessing```. I used ```try``` in ```get_entrez_esearch_response()``` in order to observe whether it is due to query is _unreadable_. Turns out, after returning some ```uid```, ```get_entrez_esearch_response()``` would occur exceptions and keep printing the same set of queries in the while loop. I understand that NCBI server has limited our request queries per second, but why would it not start requesting from the next second?\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom Bio import Entrez\r\nfrom pathos.multiprocessing import ProcessingPool\r\n\r\ndef get_entrez_esearch_response(query):\r\n    while True:\r\n        try:\r\n            handle = Entrez.esearch(db=“gds”, term=query)\r\n            uid = Entrez.read(handle)[&quot;IdList&quot;][0]\r\n            handle.close()\r\n            return uid\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            print(e)\r\n            print(query)\r\n\r\ndef get_entrez_esearch_response_parallel(queries):\r\n    with ProcessingPool(2) as p:\r\n        uid_list = p.map(get_entrez_esearch_response, queries)\r\n        print(uid_list)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n#uid1\r\n#uid2\r\n#uid3\r\n#uid4\r\n(GSE99020) AND &quot;gse&quot;[Entry Type]\r\nHTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests\r\n(GSE92593) AND &quot;gse&quot;[Entry Type]\r\nHTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests\r\n(GSE25220) AND &quot;gse&quot;[Entry Type]\r\nHTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests\r\n(GSE92593) AND &quot;gse&quot;[Entry Type]\r\nHTTP Error 429: Too Many Requests\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493092/biopython-entrez-request-in-multiprocessing-fails","title":"Biopython Entrez request in multiprocessing fails"},{"tags":["swift","xcode","swiftui","xcode11"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1434,"user_id":7948372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1f349a196d62bc8e69a1fe2d3250161?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LuLuGaGa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7948372/lulugaga"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571690602,"creation_date":1571690602,"answer_id":58493864,"question_id":58493091,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58493864","body_markdown":"It&#39;s a double NavigationBar.

However, what if I invoke `RegisterNatives()` once per function, each time with an array size of one method? Examples for contrast (did not compile these, in fact I just quickly typed them up, so please forgive any errors):\r\n\r\nOne call, many functions (idiomatic use case):\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Assume static functions `add` and `sub` have been defined\r\njclass clazz = env-&gt;FindClass(&quot;com/company/MyJavaClass&quot;);\r\n\r\nstd::vector&lt;JNINativeMethod&gt; methods {\r\n  {&quot;add&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;, (void*)&amp;add },\r\n  {&quot;sub&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;, (void*)&amp;sub },\r\n};\r\n\r\nenv-&gt;RegisterNatives(clazz, methods.data(), methods.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nMany calls, one function per call:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// Assume static functions `add` and `sub` have been defined\r\njclass clazz = env-&gt;FindClass(&quot;com/company/MyJavaClass&quot;);\r\n\r\nstd::vector&lt;JNINativeMethod&gt; methods1 {\r\n  {&quot;add&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;, (void*)&amp;add },\r\n};\r\n\r\nenv-&gt;RegisterNatives(clazz, methods1.data(), methods1.size());\r\n\r\nstd::vector&lt;JNINativeMethod&gt; methods2 {\r\n  {&quot;sub&quot;, &quot;(II)I&quot;, (void*)&amp;sub },\r\n};\r\n\r\nenv-&gt;RegisterNatives(clazz, methods2.data(), methods2.size());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny differences between the two other than syntax? I&#39;m not sure if there are performance issues with this, or if this is even allowed. I didn&#39;t see anything in the JNI documentation explicitly prohibiting it.\r\n\r\nFor context, the reason I want to do it this way is because I&#39;m writing some convenience wrappers around mapping C++ methods to Java `native` methods, and it&#39;s much easier to do this if I immediately register each individual method instead of building a container and registering that container at a later point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493082/android-jni-registernatives-call-once-with-everything-or-once-per-function","title":"Android JNI RegisterNatives: Call once with everything, or once per function"},{"tags":["css","angular","angular-material","spinner"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9396070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KSmHBpS5DEo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFhI/jGR96Hc8zuc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kishore Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9396070/kishore-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571800539,"post_id":58499419,"comment_id":103356783,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493077/angular-material-how-to-change-the-background-color-for-the-mat-spinner-path/58499419#comment103356783_58499419"},{"owner":{"reputation":7494,"user_id":8757883,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQGYY.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Akber Iqbal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8757883/akber-iqbal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9396070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-KSmHBpS5DEo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFhI/jGR96Hc8zuc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kishore Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9396070/kishore-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571804815,"post_id":58499419,"comment_id":103357566,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493077/angular-material-how-to-change-the-background-color-for-the-mat-spinner-path/58499419#comment103357566_58499419"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7494,"user_id":8757883,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gQGYY.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Akber Iqbal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8757883/akber-iqbal"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571730580,"creation_date":1571730580,"answer_id":58499419,"question_id":58493077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499419","body_markdown":"The circle is created dynamically, so you wouldn&#39;t find a property to color the remaining portion (since that remaining portion is not painted at all - there is nothing there that we can change the color of);\r\n\r\nBut you can get the effect that you&#39;re looking for... you can do this by:\r\n\r\n - creating an image of the complete circle, placing it in your `mat-card`...

If the `::after` pseudo were not set to `display: none`, it too would be a flex item of `.content`.\r\n\r\nIn short, the `.content` flex container has four items, and the pseudo is set to `order: 2`.

`.c` to wrap because the `::before` pseudo item occupies all space in a previous column with `flex-basis: 100%`. The viewport sets the height limitation and break point for the wrap.\r\n\r\nWhen you enable `align-items: center`, the container (`.content`) is centered vertically through the distribution of free space. There is no height limitation anymore. There is no break point telling items to wrap. So all items (including the pseudo) remain in a single column.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .container {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      align-items: center;  /* enabled */\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      max-width: 960px;\r\n      margin: auto;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      flex-flow: column wrap;\r\n      align-content: space-between;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n      background-color: gold;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content::before,\r\n    .content::after {\r\n      content: &#39;X&#39;;\r\n      flex-basis: 100%;\r\n      /* width: 0; */\r\n      order: 2;\r\n      position: relative;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content::after {\r\n      display: none;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .content&gt;* {\r\n      flex-grow: 1;\r\n      flex-shrink: 1;\r\n      min-height: 0.0033rem;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .a {\r\n      width: calc(100% / 3 * 2 + 0.0033rem);\r\n      order: 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .b {\r\n      width: calc(100% / 3 * 1 + 0.0033rem);\r\n      order: 2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .c {\r\n      width: calc(100% / 3 * 1 + 0.0033rem);\r\n      order: 2;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .a {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .b {\r\n      background: green;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .c {\r\n      background: blue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .a,\r\n    .b,\r\n    .c {\r\n      padding: 1rem;\r\n      min-height: 120px;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    * {\r\n      padding: 0;\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    *::before,\r\n    *::after {\r\n      box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    html,\r\n    body {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      font: 1rem/1.5 sans-serif;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;a&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;b&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493076/nested-grid-layout-using-flexbox-and-before-hack/58493882#58493882","title":"Nested grid layout using flexbox and before hack"}],"owner":{"reputation":214,"user_id":8056221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29406a9e0e7c8b88114b85f692abd15e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dmitry Chebakov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8056221/dmitry-chebakov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":214,"user_id":8056221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29406a9e0e7c8b88114b85f692abd15e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dmitry Chebakov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8056221/dmitry-chebakov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58493882,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571692864,"creation_date":1571686691,"last_edit_date":1571687081,"question_id":58493076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493076","body_markdown":"Can someone explain how this example works? \r\n\r\n 1.

As mentioned in the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors), if you don&#39;t provide a constructor for your class, C# creates one by default that instantiates the object and sets member variables to the default values.
