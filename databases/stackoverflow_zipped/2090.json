Why is that?\r\n\r\nI know that a semi-colon is missing after the &quot;&amp;#xB2&quot; and the others but otherwise it would show a &quot;&#178;&quot; in the post and you wouldn&#39;t be able to tell them apart.\r\n\r\nThis is what my dialog looks like:\r\n\r\n[![dialog][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHere some of my code for the creation of the dialog. It is called when a button is pressed.\t\t\t\r\n\r\n   \r\n               let sUnicodeChar = &quot;&amp;#xB2;&quot;;\r\n               let oDialog = new sap.m.Dialog({\r\n    \t\t\t\ttitle:

They just operate on the underlying collection (`listStrings`). So, here&#39;s what you expect to end up with, after each step:\r\n``` Java\r\n//listStrings\r\nCollections.sort(listStrings);\r\n//listStrings sorted alphabetically, case sensitive\r\nCollections.sort(listStrings, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\r\n//listStrings sorted alphabetically, case insensitive\r\nCollections.sort(listStrings, Collections.reverseOrder());\r\n//listStrings sorted alphabetically in reverse order, case insensitive\r\nCollections.sort(listStrings, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER);\r\n//listStrings sorted alphabetically, case insensitive\r\nCollections.reverse(listStrings);\r\n//listStrings sorted alphabetically in reverse order, case insensitive\r\n```\r\nFinally, after making all these changes to `listStrings`, you attempt to print the collection. The problem you run into here, is that you don&#39;t actually flush the output stream, which is likely buffered. So, nothing will be printed. I&#39;ve rewritten your code to have the exact same effect on `listStrings`, and print the output, like so:\r\n``` Java\r\npublic static void doIt(BufferedReader r, PrintWriter w) throws IOException\r\n{\r\n\tList&lt;String&gt; listStrings = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\tString line;\r\n\twhile((line = r.readLine()) != null)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tlistStrings.add(line);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tCollections.sort(listStrings, String.CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER.reversed());\r\n\t\r\n\tfor(String text : listStrings)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tw.println(text);\r\n\t}\r\n\tw.flush();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI call it from my main method like so:\r\n``` Java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws Exception\r\n{\r\n\tdoIt(new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)), new PrintWriter(System.out));\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere is the resulting effect:  \r\nInput:\r\n``` no-lang\r\nABCD\r\nbcde\r\nfegh\r\nijkl\r\n```\r\nOutput:\r\n``` no-lang\r\nijkl\r\nfegh\r\nbcde\r\nABCD\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044023/java-output-text-in-case-in-sensitive-order/58044180#58044180","title":"java - output text in case in-sensitive order"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12077792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50def04277450a5decb309cfd5e6d3d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dobrikella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077792/dobrikella"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12077792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50def04277450a5decb309cfd5e6d3d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dobrikella","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12077792/dobrikella"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58044180,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569100544,"creation_date":1569099336,"last_edit_date":1569100529,"question_id":58044023,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58044023","body_markdown":"So I&#39;m new to java and I am currently learning about how to read textfiles.

For example, if you have a single line of text that is ten characters long, inserting at `&quot;3.0&quot;` will add it to the first line. If you want to create a new line you must insert a newline character.\r\n\r\nNote: `END` is the name of a constant provided by tkinter. It is set to the string `&quot;end&quot;`. You can use either the string or the constant.\r\n\r\n&gt; 2-I&#39;m getting only the chars that come before a new line in the result of the text.get() function call the way I have it typed. \r\n\r\nThat&#39;s too vague to address. The `get` function will always return the characters between the two indexes provided to it. If you&#39;re not getting the characters you expect, you&#39;re probably giving it bad indexes. \r\n\r\nAs I&#39;ve said in other answers and comments to your questions, **indexes are not floating point numbers**. Rather, **indexes are strings** in the form of _line_._character_. Thus, you need to use string formatting. You should *never* use floating point math when computing text widget indexes. \r\n\r\nFor example, lets assume you have a line number in `n` and you want to compute the index of the 30th character from the start of line number `n`. You can compute an index like this:\r\n\r\n    n = 1\r\n    index = &quot;{}.0 +30c&quot;.format(n)  \r\n    # =&gt; &quot;1.0+30c&quot;\r\n\r\nThe first half of that converts the integer `1` to the string `1.0`, and then appends `+30c`. If you have the number of characters in an _integer_ `y`, you could do this:\r\n\r\n    y = 30\r\n    n = 1\r\n    index = &quot;{}.0+{}c&quot;.format(n,y)\r\n    # =&gt; &quot;1.0+30c&quot;\r\n\r\nNote: This will only work if `x` and `y` are integers. In your code you are initializing `self.a` to a floating point number. A line number or a character number is an _integer_, and an index using those numbers must be a _string_.\r\n\r\nFor more information on the `format` method, see [str.format()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format) in the official python documentation.\r\n\r\n&gt; 3-The text widget will jump over lines of text that have no newlines searching for a newline.\r\n\r\nAgain, the text widget will get whatever you tell it to get. It will &quot;jump over lines&quot; only if you give it two indexes that span lines.

Or really, 30 chars at a time- char typed there or not (the length of one widget line)\r\n\r\n    from tkinter import *\r\n    import re \r\n    \r\n    class TextCompiler:\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self, master):\r\n    \r\n            self.a = 1.0\r\n            self.countString = StringVar()\r\n            self.countString.set(&quot;Current Processing Line: &quot; + str(self.a))\r\n            \r\n            self.frame = Frame(master)\r\n            self.frame.pack()\r\n    \r\n            self.topLabel = Label(master, text = &quot;Enter text to be compiled: &quot;, bg = &quot;green&quot;, fg = &quot;black&quot;)\r\n            self.topLabel.pack(side = TOP)\r\n    \r\n            self.windowIn = Text(master, height=20, width=30)\r\n            self.windowIn.pack(side = LEFT)\r\n            self.windowOut = Text(master, height=20, width=30)\r\n            self.windowOut.pack(side = RIGHT)\r\n            \r\n            self.printButton = Button(self.frame, text=&quot;Compile next line?&quot;, command = lambda: self.transferPrint(self.a))\r\n            self.printButton.pack(side = BOTTOM)\r\n    \r\n            self.quitButton = Button(self.frame, text=&quot;Quit&quot;, command=lambda: self.quitStuff(master))\r\n            self.quitButton.pack(side = BOTTOM)\r\n    \r\n            self.count = Label(master, textvariable = self.countString)\r\n            self.count.pack(side = BOTTOM)\r\n    \r\n        def transferPrint(self, a):\r\n            b = self.a + 0.30\r\n            #c=self.a+1.0\r\n            endOfLine = &quot;{0:.2f}&quot;.format(b)\r\n            # = &quot;{} lineend&quot;.format(self.a)\r\n            #endOfLine = endOfLine + &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n            inputText = self.windowIn.get(self.a, endOfLine)\r\n            self.windowOut.insert(self.a, inputText)\r\n            self.a = self.a + 1.0\r\n            self.countString.set(&quot;Current Processing Line: &quot; + str(self.a))\r\n            \r\n    \r\n        def quitStuff(self, master):\r\n            self.frame.quit()\r\n            master.destroy()\r\n    \r\n    root = Tk()\r\n    TextCompiler(root)\r\n    root.mainloop() this is part of the program, wont go in the box\r\n\r\nI think I already said what I want. What I&#39;m getting is three things. 1-The insert just inserts at the end of the current string that is present in the output text widget. makes me think it is looking for &quot;END&quot; or &quot;end&quot; I don&#39;t know which one but I also think this is a problem caused by the overloaded index types this function takes. \r\n2-I&#39;m getting only the chars that come before a new line in the result of the text.get() function call the way I have it typed.\r\n3-The text widget will jump over lines of text that have no newlines searching for a newline. This throws off the line count index.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044001/how-make-the-indicies-of-the-tkinter-text-get-function-variable","title":"How make the indicies of the tkinter.text.get() function variable?"},{"tags":["web","virtual-server"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569100295,"post_id":58044076,"comment_id":102488518,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044000/virtual-server-port-forwarding/58044076#comment102488518_58044076"},{"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":7206829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4ab1f620f40319bcecca9ea464b1959?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kareem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7206829/kareem"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569100575,"post_id":58044076,"comment_id":102488577,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044000/virtual-server-port-forwarding/58044076#comment102488577_58044076"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569101316,"post_id":58044076,"comment_id":102488725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044000/virtual-server-port-forwarding/58044076#comment102488725_58044076"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569102994,"post_id":58044076,"comment_id":102488990,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044000/virtual-server-port-forwarding/58044076#comment102488990_58044076"},{"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":7206829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4ab1f620f40319bcecca9ea464b1959?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kareem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7206829/kareem"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569105254,"post_id":58044076,"comment_id":102489274,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044000/virtual-server-port-forwarding/58044076#comment102489274_58044076"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":7206829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4ab1f620f40319bcecca9ea464b1959?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kareem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7206829/kareem"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569099825,"creation_date":1569099825,"answer_id":58044076,"question_id":58044000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58044076","body_markdown":"There are a few parts to this answer:\r\n\r\nTo keep it simple I am going to assume a few things as you did not specify too many things. \r\n\r\n**What you have**\r\n\r\nUbuntu Server VM running on your Windows machine \r\n\r\n**What you are trying to do**\r\n\r\nConnect to the VM (running Apache2) to view a website on the server via your public IP\r\n\r\n*If either of these are incorrect let me know*\r\n\r\n 1.

My aim is to create an xml document with the form&#39;s input.

Attributes are also part of the form. User should be able to enter them as normal form fields. I am desperately looking for a solution.

This means `sizeof(data)` evaluates to the size of `char [12]` which is 12.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043983/about-typecasting-of-an-array-to-pointers/58044060#58044060","title":"About typecasting of an array to pointers"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":685,"user_id":5878272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14e96159153b67fab5222b7c5fa18c71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fredrik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5878272/fredrik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569103154,"post_id":58044084,"comment_id":102489007,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043983/about-typecasting-of-an-array-to-pointers/58044084#comment102489007_58044084"},{"owner":{"reputation":2489,"user_id":2801913,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ffbc065ffbc6e7597c5044f65c1ed40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graeme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2801913/graeme"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":685,"user_id":5878272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14e96159153b67fab5222b7c5fa18c71?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fredrik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5878272/fredrik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569103930,"post_id":58044084,"comment_id":102489108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043983/about-typecasting-of-an-array-to-pointers/58044084#comment102489108_58044084"},{"owner":{"reputation":94494,"user_id":298225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef102f4ee36e58d09e0b27cd5393a1d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Postpischil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298225/eric-postpischil"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569110122,"post_id":58044084,"comment_id":102489922,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043983/about-typecasting-of-an-array-to-pointers/58044084#comment102489922_58044084"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2489,"user_id":2801913,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ffbc065ffbc6e7597c5044f65c1ed40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graeme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2801913/graeme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2489,"user_id":2801913,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ffbc065ffbc6e7597c5044f65c1ed40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graeme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2801913/graeme"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569103875,"last_edit_date":1569103875,"creation_date":1569099876,"answer_id":58044084,"question_id":58043983,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58044084","body_markdown":"Outwith the declaration, you can consider `data` to be equivalent to a pointer to the start of the array, but with the following exceptions:\r\n\r\n - `sizeof(data)` will give you the size of the array in bytes.\r\n - `_Alignof(data)` will be the same as `_Alignof(*data)` (and both give you the alignment of the type of the array elements)\r\n - `&amp;data` has the same value as just `data`, but have a type of `char (*)[sizeof(data]` so arithmetic will use the full size of the array.

For example. postal code P0G, P0A (the first 3 digits of Canadian postal code, which represents an area) with associated values 2 and 5, I want to display different colors (maybe 2 with green and 5 with red) on these two areas on a real map.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how tbh, maybe using Python or some website service or some API?

No difference if I initialize a separate `Redis` instance for the `Queue` (or leave the counter stuff out entirely).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m running this stack using `docker stack deploy` with a `docker-compose.yml` that is not too modified from the beginner&#39;s tutorial:\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: &quot;3&quot;\r\nservices:\r\n  web:\r\n    image: ozydingo/workers-web:latest\r\n    deploy: #...\r\n    ports:\r\n      - &quot;80:80&quot;\r\n    networks:\r\n      - webnet\r\n  worker:\r\n    image: ozydingo/workers-worker:latest\r\n    deploy: #...\r\n    networks:\r\n      - webnet\r\n  redis:\r\n    image: redis\r\n    ports:\r\n      - &quot;6379:6379&quot;\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - &quot;/home/docker/data:/data&quot;\r\n    deploy: #...\r\n    networks:\r\n      - webnet\r\n#...\r\nnetworks:\r\n  webnet:\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow should I interpret an error from `Queue` claiming no Redis connection could be resolved when my `redis` instance is telling me otherwise?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043959/rq-in-docker-could-not-resolve-a-redis-connection-with-an-otherwise-working-r","title":"rq in Docker: &quot;Could not resolve a Redis connection&quot; with an otherwise working redis connection"},{"tags":["python-3.x","mocking","pytest","asyncio","magicmock"],"owner":{"reputation":442,"user_id":8826524,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/709c267b2ae4fc621fd988fe346d39af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"may","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8826524/may"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569098621,"creation_date":1569098621,"question_id":58043957,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58043957","body_markdown":"The code sample is something like this:\r\n\r\n    @pytest.mark.asyncio\r\n    async def test_a(my_obj,b, mocker): \r\n        await my_obj.a()\r\n        res = &#39;some_message&#39;\r\n        b.assert_called_with(res)\r\n\r\nI have not been able to mock method C() from my class, and it makes my tests fail because `concurrent.futures._base.TimeoutError`\r\n\r\n\r\n    MyClass():\r\n    \r\n    async def a():\r\n       await c()\r\n       b()\r\n\r\nI am confusing the mock functions and I have tried mocking from the path with several variations and it did not work\r\n\r\n    from path import __init__, MyClass\r\n    asyncio_c = mocker.patch(&#39;path.MyClass.c&#39;,new=CoroutineMock())\r\n\r\nAny ideas.

You can use it to satisfy the requirement of operator overload ([see it online](https://wandbox.org/permlink/dF5WO0tcgIqovuE0)):\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n    \r\n    void operator |( int *vet , std::function&lt;void(int)&gt; func){\r\n        for ( int i = 0 ; i &lt; 10; i++){\r\n            func(vet[i]);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, the syntax you propose is really bad. It looks plain wrong to any reader who know C++. My first thought upon seeing this would be &quot;*Someone made a typo and put `|` instead of `=`. Also, where&#39;s the type?*&quot;. Plus, you cannot really use it as pipe, because you don&#39;t return anything. Piping second call would return in call to `operator |(void, [function_type])`.\r\n\r\nIt would be bearable with named functions:\r\n\r\n    auto squarePrinter = []( int x ) { cout &lt;&lt; x*x &lt;&lt; endl; };\r\n    tab | squarePrinter;\r\n\r\nbut it&#39;s still confusing - it&#39;s not Bash code, is it?\r\n\r\nBest and most readable solution is to use well-known functions and idioms from standard - [`std::for_each`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/for_each), as suggested by Some Programmer Dude, or even plain `for` loop\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;algorithm&gt;\r\n\r\n

really recommend [this][1] excellent asyncio walkthrough, which should answer most of your questions.\r\n\r\nA quote from the mentioned article in the light of your code:\r\n\r\n&gt; [...] async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses cooperative multitasking, a term that [...] gives a feeling of concurrency despite using a single thread in a single process.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want your program to block while processing (IO) requests (as stated in your question), concurrency is sufficient (and you don&#39;t need (multi)threading)!\r\n\r\n&gt; Concurrency [...] suggests that multiple tasks have the ability to run in an overlapping manner. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll repeat the exact example from the mentioned article, which has a similar structure as your example:\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n    # countasync.py\r\n    \r\n    import asyncio\r\n    \r\n    async def count():\r\n        print(&quot;One&quot;)\r\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n        print(&quot;Two&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    async def main():\r\n        await asyncio.gather(count(), count(), count())\r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n        import time\r\n        s = time.perf_counter()\r\n        asyncio.run(main())\r\n        elapsed = time.perf_counter() - s\r\n        print(f&quot;{__file__} executed in {elapsed:0.2f} seconds.&quot;)\r\n\r\nThis runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ python3 countasync.py\r\n    One\r\n    One\r\n    One\r\n    Two\r\n    Two\r\n    Two\r\n    countasync.py executed in 1.01 seconds.\r\n\r\nNote that this examples uses `asyncio.gather` to kick-off the three `count()` processes in a non-blocking manner. Putting three `await count()` statements after one another won&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, this is *exactly* what you are looking for. As demonstrated, you don&#39;t need `threading` to achieve this.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

It is NOT the ASCII value of `B`, which happens to be `66` in decimal...  That is what you want to be passed to isspace.. the value stored in that memory location, not the address of the memory location.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the toughest things for beginners to C, once you get a good visual in your head of when you are manipulating the address of a location in memory and when you are manipulating the data stored at that location, the rest of C is pretty easy...\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043897/how-to-fix-argument-of-type-is-incompatible-with-parameter-of-type/58043955#58043955","title":"How to fix argument of type is incompatible with parameter of type"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":9079081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7409cd4d62d16dd664d79c810bd9e4e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Breaks Coder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9079081/breaks-coder"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58043925,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569099232,"creation_date":1569098111,"question_id":58043897,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58043897","body_markdown":"I used the function `isspace` to search through a word for white spaces.

But it has still to check the key you are looking for against every stored key having the same hash. This is the step 2 that will be faster : strings identity is tested before the expensive test, char by char, of the string equality.\r\n\r\nThe step 1 is harder to accelerate, because you can store the hash along with the interned string... but you have to compute the hash to find the interned string itself.\r\n\r\nThis was theory! If you really need to improve performance, first do some benchmarks.\r\n\r\nThen think of the specificity of the domain. You are storing IPv4 addresses as keys. An IPv4 address is a number between 0 and 256^4. If you replace the human friendly representation of an address by an integer, you&#39;ll get a faster hash (hashing small numbers in CPython if almost costless: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Python/pyhash.c) and a faster lookup. The [`ip_address` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ipaddress.html) might be the best choice in your case.\r\n\r\nIf you are sure that addresses are between boundaries (e.g. 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255) you can try to use an array instead of a dict. It should be faster unless your array is huge (disk swap).\r\n\r\nFinally, if this is not fast enough, be ready to use a faster language.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58043862/how-to-intern-dictionary-string-keys-in-python/58122762#58122762","title":"how to intern dictionary string keys in python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":535,"user_id":964491,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4758a41e90f6f8189bc6b7c4404dcf09?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/964491/dan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58122762,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569522511,"creation_date":1569097723,"question_id":58043862,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58043862","body_markdown":"After reading that interning string can help with performance.

But, it&#39;s well-known that you can modify this mergesort algorithm by splitting the arrays until you have, say, k subarrays, each of size n/k (n is the original length of the array). You can then use insertion sort to sort each one of those k subarrays and merge them using the merge subroutine.\r\n\r\n\r\nIntuitively, I think that this should be better than just merge sort in some cases because insertion sort is fast on small arrays. But I want to figure out precisely when this hybrid algorithm is better than the regular merge sort algorithm.

have been strugling for a few hours trying to install Vuetify in my laravel project but I cannot make it work correctly, the Vuetify components are working well but Icons and breakpoints are not, I tried everything and now Im kinda tired of this, I hope someone can help me...\r\n\r\nFollowing the vuetify documentation I wrote this in my app.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nrequire(&#39;./bootstrap&#39;);\r\n\r\nimport Vue from &#39;vue&#39;;\r\nimport Vuex from &#39;vuex&#39;;\r\nimport router from &#39;./router&#39;\r\n\r\nimport vuetify from &#39;./plugins/vuetify.js&#39; // path to vuetify export\r\n\r\nVue.use(Vuex);\r\n\r\nnew Vue({\r\n  vuetify,\r\n  router,\r\n}).$mount(&#39;#app&#39;)\r\n```\r\nand separately, a vuetify.js file\r\n\r\n```Javascript\r\nimport &#39;@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css&#39; // Ensure you are using css-loader\r\nimport Vue from &#39;vue&#39;\r\nimport Vuetify from &#39;vuetify/lib&#39;\r\n\r\nVue.use(Vuetify)\r\n\r\nexport default new Vuetify({\r\n  icons: {\r\n    iconfont: &#39;mdi&#39;, // default - only for display purposes\r\n  },\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nand added the vuetify-loader to my webpack.mix.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst mix = require(&#39;laravel-mix&#39;);\r\nconst VuetifyLoaderPlugin = require(&#39;vuetify-loader/lib/plugin&#39;);\r\n\r\nmix.js(&#39;resources/js/app.js&#39;, &#39;public/js&#39;)\r\n    .sass(&#39;resources/sass/app.scss&#39;, &#39;public/css&#39;);\r\n\r\n    mix.webpackConfig({\r\n        plugins: [\r\n            new VuetifyLoaderPlugin(),\r\n        ]\r\n    }).sourceMaps();\r\n\r\n    mix.disableSuccessNotifications();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst of all, having this configuration the project wont even run, I get this error: ```&quot;Error: Conflict: Multiple assets emit to the same filename fonts/vendor/@mdi/materialdesignicons-webfont.eot?a32fa1f27abbfa96ff2f79e1ade723d5&quot;```\r\n\r\nSo I removed the ```import &quot;@mdi/font/css/materialdesignicons.css&quot;``` from the vuetify.js file, no errors but the icons are not visible.\r\n\r\nI took the code from the documentation of Toolbar and pasted in my project and this is how it looks\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is the code for that empty toolbar\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;template&gt;\r\n  &lt;v-card\r\n    color=&quot;grey lighten-4&quot; flat height=&quot;200px&quot; tile&gt;\r\n    &lt;v-toolbar dense&gt;\r\n      &lt;v-app-bar-nav-icon&gt;&lt;/v-app-bar-nav-icon&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;v-toolbar-title&gt;Title&lt;/v-toolbar-title&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;flex-grow-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;v-btn icon&gt;\r\n        &lt;v-icon&gt;mdi-magnify&lt;/v-icon&gt;\r\n      &lt;/v-btn&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;v-btn icon&gt;\r\n        &lt;v-icon&gt;mdi-heart&lt;/v-icon&gt;\r\n      &lt;/v-btn&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;v-btn icon&gt;\r\n        &lt;v-icon&gt;mdi-dots-vertical&lt;/v-icon&gt;\r\n      &lt;/v-btn&gt;\r\n    &lt;/v-toolbar&gt;\r\n  &lt;/v-card&gt;\r\n&lt;/template&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change ```iconfont``` from &#39;mdi&#39; to &#39;mdiSvg&#39; from the ```vuetify.js``` file I do get one icon but the others still missing\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation, this toolbar should look something like this:[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nbut that&#39;s not it yet, I cannot even use vuetify breakpoints like ```$vuetify.breakpoint.smAndUp``` I get an undefined error in console\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:
