opinionated, so this answer essentially ... is an opinion.\r\n\r\nthe way I see it: the more non-standard functions/filters are used in a template, the worse off you&#39;re semantically. On one hand, whoever is editing or create the templates has to know of those functions/filter, which - in my opinion - is not desirable.\r\n\r\nAlso, as DarkBee already mentioned in the question&#39;s comment, filters are for transforming data, not fetching it. a twig function would be more appropriate, but I don&#39;t like it either because of the reason above (it also exposes *all* templates to that function, unless precautions are taken, on the other hand, it is expected to exist in all templates).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the template editor/creator also have to know about which variables may exist in the current context. So ultimately there is some prior knowledge required. \r\n\r\nI want to propose a slightly different (and in my arrogant but humble opinion also *better*) option ...\r\n\r\nAs far as I see it, it would be better, if you could just use \r\n\r\n     {% for photo in post.photos %}\r\n           {# display of photos #}\r\n     {% endfor %}\r\n\r\nbecause they *are semantically* connected to the post, and also it makes sense to assume they are also structurally connected. Since your use case seems a little different, it would possibly be:\r\n\r\n     {% for photo in posts.photos %}\r\n\r\nwhich of course has different semantics and really screws with `posts` being an array, where `photos` be one element. However, imaginge the collection being an object, that has extra functions (I&#39;ll shamelessly extend doctrine&#39;s [`ArrayCollection`][1]):\r\n\r\n     &lt;?php\r\n\r\n     namespace App\\Collection;\r\n \r\n     use Doctrine\\Common\\Collections\\ArrayCollection;\r\n     use App\\Service\\PhotoService;\r\n\r\n     class PostCollection extends ArrayCollection {\r\n         public $photoService;\r\n \r\n         public function __construct(array $elements, PhotoService $photoService) {\r\n             parent::__construct($elements);\r\n             $this-&gt;photoService = $photoService;\r\n         }\r\n\r\n         public function getPhotos() {\r\n             return $this-&gt;photoService-&gt;getReadMorePhotos($this-&gt;toArray())\r\n         }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nand this is then to be called in your controller:\r\n\r\n    $response = $this-&gt;render(\r\n        &#39;/content/photos.html.twig&#39;,\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;posts&#39; =&gt; new PostCollection($posts, $photoService),\r\n            &#39;loadMoreUrl&#39; =&gt; $url,\r\n            &#39;limit&#39; =&gt; $limit\r\n        )\r\n    );\r\n\r\nand can then be used as written above.\r\n\r\nWhy does this work? [`ArrayCollection`][1] implements a few interfaces among which there is [`ArrayAccess`][2] as well as [`IteratorAggregate`][3] (which extends [`Traversable`][4]), which lets you use it in a loop, and it will provide the collection it was given in its constructor (or which is changed in the modification methods), if the need arises, you can always retrieve an array via `ArrayCollection::toArray`.\r\n\r\nWhy do this? To get clean code.\r\n\r\nDo I do this? No, tbh. But this is partly due to my habit of realizing almost all relations in the database, which in combination with ORM give me some of this for free.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.doctrine-project.org/api/collections/latest/Doctrine/Common/Collections/Collection.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.php.net/ArrayAccess\r\n  [3]: https://www.php.net/IteratorAggregate\r\n  [4]: https://www.php.net/traversable","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144784/what-is-more-effective-filling-variables-with-twig-filters-or-passing-them-thro/58145004#58145004","title":"What is more effective: filling variables with twig filters or passing them through the controller?"}],"owner":{"reputation":172,"user_id":6390518,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4q6sA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"IT-Girl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6390518/it-girl"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569669383,"creation_date":1569660700,"question_id":58144784,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58144784","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve recently been using my own custom made twig filters.

have set of data (values from 0 to 1) with corresponding coordinates, and I want to plot those data on map with matplotlib&#39;s `contourf`.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I have 30-40 data points and a coordinate grid of 270x480 and those contours looks like tiny dots.\r\n\r\nSo I need to interpolate data some way, so lonely dot will look like little spot, and those spots will merge together.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read a lot of samples of interpolating, but almost all of them about one-dimensional data or some very complicated examples.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried

I checked to see if the routeName of the previous page was in the state but it still doesnt do anything.\r\n\r\n\r\nList Screen\r\nHere is my Button, I am passing an id from a reducer and the routeName of the currentscreen into the navigation params\r\n\r\n    renderList = () =&gt; {\r\n        const { lists } = this.props;\r\n        if(lists) {\r\n            return (lists.data.map(el =&gt; {\r\n                return (\r\n                    &lt;TouchableOpacity\r\n                        key={el.id}\r\n                        onPress={ () =&gt; this.props.navigation.navigate(&#39;PostItem&#39;, { nid: el.id, prevScreen: this.props.navigation.state.routeName})}&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Text&gt;Next Screen&lt;/Text&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/TouchableOpacity&gt;\r\n                )}\r\n            ))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nListDetail Screen\r\n   \r\n \r\n\r\n    class listDetail extends Component {\r\n        \r\n            constructor(props) {\r\n                super(props);\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            componentDidMount() {\r\n                this.props.loadPost(&#39;article&#39;, this.props.navigation.state.params.nid + &#39;?include=field_image&#39;)\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            render() {\r\n                const { goBack } = this.props.navigation;\r\n                return (\r\n                    &lt;View&gt;\r\n                        &lt;Button title=&quot;Back&quot; onPress={() =&gt; goBack(this.props.navigation.state.params.prevScreen)} /&gt;\r\n                        { this.renderPost() }\r\n                    &lt;/View&gt;\r\n                )\r\n        \r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nany suggestions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144695/react-navigation-back-button-doesnt-do-anything","title":"React Navigation Back Button Doesnt do anything"},{"tags":["apollo","next.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8869942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RrPqr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Anand Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8869942/anand-singh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569662321,"creation_date":1569662321,"answer_id":58144954,"question_id":58144694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58144954","body_markdown":"In Apollo client you can specify **fetchPolicy: network-only** to always get updated data without refreshing the page\n\nThere is one more option provided by Apollo is **refechQueries** you can use this also.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144694/how-to-refetch-all-query-when-come-back-to-home-page-using-apollo-client/58144954#58144954","title":"How to refetch all query when come back to home page using apollo client"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10667377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-2CIkgvR64DQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-gY7gSk7YJWc4XpImh37JzEwcggGg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Demon Prince","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10667377/demon-prince"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569662321,"creation_date":1569659869,"question_id":58144694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58144694","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using appollo client and nextjs, when i use next/link to go back to home page (client side), all data of my homepage still old and doesn&#39;t update to new data (I think it used cache data).

The way `readFile` (and other Node.js callback-style functions) are written, they call their callback with the error as the first argument, or `null` as the first argument. The *name* of that parameter in the function signature is irrelevant (you can call it anything you like; `err`, `e`, and `error` are all common). It&#39;s the fact it&#39;s the first parameter that matters, because it will receive the first argument when called.\r\n\r\nIn these modern times, though, things are moving away from Node.js callback-style APIs and toward APIs using Promises, which make the error and success paths much more distinct. Then `async`/`await` syntax is layered on top of promises to make it possible to write asynchronous code using the standard logical flow control structures.\r\n\r\nNode.js callback style (like your code):\r\n\r\n    const fs = require(&quot;fs&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    fs.readFile(&#39;/foo.txt&#39;, function(err, data) {\r\n        // If an error occurred, handle it (throw, propagate, etc)\r\n        if (err) {\r\n            // It failed\r\n            console.log(err);\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        // It worked\r\n        console.log(data);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nWith promises via the [`fs.promises`][1] API:\r\n\r\n    const fsp = require(&quot;fs&quot;).promises;\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    fsp.readFile(&#39;/foo.txt&#39;)\r\n    .then(data =&gt; {\r\n        // It worked\r\n        console.log(data);\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(err =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(err);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nOf course, you may not handle errors at that level; you might instead return the result of calling `then` so that the caller can chain off it and handle errors (or pass it off to *its* caller, etc.).\r\n\r\nWith `async`/`await` (this must be *inside* an `async` function, although in modules top-level await is coming):\r\n\r\n    const fsp = require(&quot;fs&quot;).promises;\r\n\r\n    // ...inside an `async` function:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        const data = await fsp.readFile(&#39;/foo.txt&#39;);\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n        console.log(err);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd again, you might not handle errors at that level; you might let them propagate and have the caller handle them (or the caller might let them propgate to *its* caller to handle them, etc.).\r\n\r\nNot all of Node.js&#39;s API has promises yet. You can wrap a single callback-style API function with promises via [`util.promisify`][2]; you can wrap an entire API via various `npm` modules like [`promisify`][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_promises_api\r\n  [2]: https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_promisify_original\r\n  [3]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/promisify\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144686/how-does-javascript-know-if-there-has-been-an-error-when-executing-a-function-c/58144719#58144719","title":"How does Javascript know if there has been an error when executing a function (callbacks)"}],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":10708260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ad7033077a07f3e0cc32cfa9672afc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J.

     \r\n```\r\nso they are rendered unconditionally. And then having extra `Switch` in your components like\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nconst AuthRouteGroup = () =&gt; {\r\n    return (\r\n        &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route path={&#39;/login&#39;} component={LoginView} /&gt;\r\n            &lt;Route path={&#39;/logout&#39;} component={LogoutView} /&gt;\r\n        &lt;Switch/&gt;\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut why id did not work?\r\n\r\nThe reason is [how `Switch` works](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/blob/master/packages/react-router/modules/Switch.js#L27):\r\n\r\n```\r\nReact.Children.forEach(this.props.children, child =&gt; {\r\n  if (match == null &amp;&amp; React.isValidElement(child)) {\r\n    element = child;\r\n    const path = child.props.path || child.props.from;\r\n\r\n    match = path\r\n      ? matchPath(location.pathname, { ...child.props, path })\r\n      : context.match;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee, even if `AuthRouteGroup` is not a `Route`, `Switch` anyway looks to its `props.path`. And once `undefined` for `props.path` matches any path **and** `Switch` renders only first matching `Route` you are getting only first component rendered.\r\n\r\n[UPD] &quot;does-not-match-any-route&quot; View will work only at top level of `Switch`. Also there are no way to know if some nested children of sibling element has matched current route or not. So only way I see is listing all routes in single place. \r\n\r\nAlternative that looks rather poor is having special route &quot;/error404&quot; and redirect user to it from inside of other components(but who should decide? and where? and when?).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144678/organizing-react-routes-into-separate-components/58144787#58144787","title":"Organizing React Routes into Separate components"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10966,"user_id":693642,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/216e924557e99637a43181a5647bf7aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"enchance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/693642/enchance"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569669156,"creation_date":1569669156,"answer_id":58145742,"question_id":58144678,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58145742","body_markdown":"It appears this current set up of treating components like OOP classes you can extend from is the wrong approach.

By moving the `&lt;Switch&gt;` to the child components and removing it from the `AllRoutes` component each component started to show. It appears adding the `&lt;Switch&gt;` in `AllRoutes` is allowing only the first hit to show which is as `&lt;Switch&gt;` does. But now by removing it it shows the 404 at the end of each page as well.\r\n\r\nBasically, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    const AllRoutes = () =&gt; {\r\n        return (\r\n            &lt;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route component={AuthRouteGroup} /&gt;      {/* This works */}\r\n                &lt;Route component={PublicRouteGroup} /&gt;    {/* This also works */}\r\n\r\n                {/* This 404 is not a route group */}\r\n                &lt;Route component={Error404View} /&gt;        {/* Always shown at the bottom */}\r\n                {/* Even putting the 404 in its own RouteGroup yields the same issue */}\r\n            &lt;/&gt;\r\n        )\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144678/organizing-react-routes-into-separate-components","title":"Organizing React Routes into Separate

this line\r\n```\r\npublic class MinPriorityQueue&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\nto this:\r\n```\r\npublic class MinPriorityQueue&lt;T extends Comparable&lt;? super T&gt;&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe issue here is that ```T extends ShortestPathVertex&lt;E&gt;``` in method ```Dijkstra```, so ```T``` needs not implement ```Comparable``` directly. But this was necessary in your version of ```MinPriorityQueue```. My change fixes this problem.\r\n\r\nExplanation: ```In MinPriorityQueue&lt;T&gt; Q = ...``` ```T``` is a subtype of ```ShortestPathVertex&lt;E&gt;``` which implements ```Comparable&lt;ShortestPathVertex&lt;E&gt;&gt;```. This means ```T``` is comparable to values of type ```ShortestPathVertex&lt;E&gt;``` (which is a super type of ```T```). But in your version of ```MinPriorityQueue``` you define that ```T``` must be comparable to the same type ```T```. If you also want to accept super type, you must define it by ```&lt;? super T&gt;```.\r\n\r\nYou can try (just for demonstration): In method ```Dijkstra``` substitute every occurence of ```T``` by ```ShortestPathVertex&lt;E&gt;```. This works also with the simpler definition of class ```MinPriorityQueue```.\r\n\r\nAnother example for using ```super``` in this way: Look at the method ```Collections.binarySearch``` in the Java Class Library.

If YES to both, the pane is shown, if NO to either, a pane is created, added to the **CustomTaskPanes** collection and is shown.\r\n\r\nIf I open (with File/New) another Excel window (without closing the first one) and the window has to show a pane, the code again check if the relevant pane exists and if it is its own, if now a pane is created and shown. It all works OK. Here is the code that checks if the pane belongs to the current window:\r\n\r\n        if (pane != null &amp;&amp; pane.Window != null &amp;&amp;\r\n                            ((Microsoft.Office.Interop.Excel.Window)pane.Window).Hwnd \r\n    == Globals.ThisAddIn.Application.ActiveWindow.Hwnd)\r\n                        {\r\n                            return true;\r\n                        }\r\n                        else\r\n                        {\r\n                            return false;\r\n                        }\r\n\r\nBut in the following scenario the app crashes:\r\n\r\n1. Open Excel, show a pane upon user action\r\n\r\n2. From File/Open menu open Excel document. The Excel document opens in the old window, i.e. another window is not created\r\n\r\n3. Before I try to show a pane I check if there are existing panes and if they belong to the current window, as explained above.    \r\n\r\n4. The problem is that the pane exists, but its control, belonging to the Excel window BEFORE opening the second Excel, is disposed of and I get this exception: **&quot;The taskpane has been deleted or is otherwise no longer valid.&quot;**\r\n\r\nOne way to fix this is to check if  pane&#39;s control is disposed of and this solution works OK.\r\n\r\nBut I want to implement a more generic solution, like when a document/window is open and the old document/window is closed, I want to delete all panes that belong to the old document/window. \r\nThis way I will not have these panes existing, rather than have them existing but with disposed of controls.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there is no **Workbook.Close()** event, in which to destroy these panes. There is a **Workbook.BeforeClose** event but it does not get triggered if I open an existing Excel doc.\r\nSo my question is: How do I detect when an Excel window is closed/Destroyed?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144654/excel-vsto-addin-invalid-task-panes","title":"Excel VSTO AddIn invalid task panes"},{"tags":["r","url","twitter"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12134152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bab496c7957d6f88b507c7338c967f64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ManuelMayrl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12134152/manuelmayrl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570095247,"post_id":58144804,"comment_id":102808670,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144653/r-automatically-translate-shortened-urls-from-twitter-data/58144804#comment102808670_58144804"},{"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9076343,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea4d3d74084d875694e1156a95bc64ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"novica","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9076343/novica"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12134152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bab496c7957d6f88b507c7338c967f64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ManuelMayrl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12134152/manuelmayrl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570107421,"post_id":58144804,"comment_id":102815064,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144653/r-automatically-translate-shortened-urls-from-twitter-data/58144804#comment102815064_58144804"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12134152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bab496c7957d6f88b507c7338c967f64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ManuelMayrl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12134152/manuelmayrl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570461472,"post_id":58144804,"comment_id":102911716,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144653/r-automatically-translate-shortened-urls-from-twitter-data/58144804#comment102911716_58144804"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9076343,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea4d3d74084d875694e1156a95bc64ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"novica","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9076343/novica"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569660962,"creation_date":1569660962,"answer_id":58144804,"question_id":58144653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58144804","body_markdown":"You can use the `httr` package. \r\n\r\n`httr::HEAD(&quot;URL&quot;)` will give you a response in the first line and then you can do the usual cleaning to get just the URL-s.

I can&#39;t find any relevant getters in the package manual.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144649/r-shiny-htmltools-extracting-a-tag-by-name","title":"R Shiny &amp; htmltools - Extracting a tag by name"},{"tags":["email","opencart","message"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":504,"user_id":8308674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6IRy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mujahid Bhoraniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8308674/mujahid-bhoraniya"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569664566,"post_id":58144646,"comment_id":102675423,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144646/opencart-sent-message#comment102675423_58144646"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3547949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a10c4a523eee86cf7ce71666b095bcd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ErkanA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3547949/erkana"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":504,"user_id":8308674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6IRy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mujahid Bhoraniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8308674/mujahid-bhoraniya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569753822,"post_id":58144646,"comment_id":102691903,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144646/opencart-sent-message#comment102691903_58144646"},{"owner":{"reputation":476,"user_id":8205646,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/m2RcF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harish ST","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8205646/harish-st"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569771096,"post_id":58144646,"comment_id":102695924,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144646/opencart-sent-message#comment102695924_58144646"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3547949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a10c4a523eee86cf7ce71666b095bcd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ErkanA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3547949/erkana"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569669927,"post_id":58145205,"comment_id":102676469,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144646/opencart-sent-message/58145205#comment102676469_58145205"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":504,"user_id":8308674,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x6IRy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mujahid Bhoraniya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8308674/mujahid-bhoraniya"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569664717,"creation_date":1569664717,"answer_id":58145205,"question_id":58144646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58145205","body_markdown":"You can use following code.\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;h2&gt;JavaScript Alert&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;button onclick=&quot;myFunction()&quot;&gt;Try it&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    function myFunction() {\r\n      alert(&quot;Thank you very much for your message, we will get back to you as soon as possible.&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\ni think it&#39;s very helpful for you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144646/opencart-sent-message/58145205#58145205","title":"Opencart &quot;sent&quot; message"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3547949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a10c4a523eee86cf7ce71666b095bcd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ErkanA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3547949/erkana"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569664717,"creation_date":1569659414,"question_id":58144646,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58144646","body_markdown":"How can we edit the &quot;SENT&quot; (javascript alert) that is generated after the customer sends a message?

above.The `for` loop code I tried to use is:\r\n\r\n    for p in range(column_length + row_length - 1):\r\n        for q in range(max(p-column_length+1,0), min(p+1, row_length)):\r\n                positive_slopes.append(rows[p - q][q])\r\n\r\nThis does not quite give the same results with the list comprehension code. This gives an output of:\r\n\r\n    [&#39;e&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;g&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;r&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;o&#39;]\r\n\r\nThe list comprehension gives me this:\r\n\r\n    [[&#39;e&#39;], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;a&#39;], [&#39;g&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;r&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;], [&#39;i&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;e&#39;], [&#39;i&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;h&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;h&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, &#39;y&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;], [&#39;a&#39;, &#39;l&#39;, &#39;i&#39;, &#39;y&#39;], [&#39;l&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;u&#39;], [&#39;l&#39;, &#39;h&#39;], [&#39;o&#39;]]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elements of both outputs are the same however I would like the for loop to group the letters like the list comprehension did. What am I missing in my `for` loop to give me the same output. Any help would be gladly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144628/getting-the-variable-from-a-for-loop","title":"Getting the variable from a for

cannot do that with a shebang, because it&#39;s format ([on Linux](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/execve.2.html)) is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!interpreter [optional-arg]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this argument is passed as single string (see &quot;Interpreter scripts&quot; and &quot;Interpreter scripts&quot; in the linked document). In other words, you cannot pass multiple arguments (unless they can be concatenated to a single string) to an interpreter. This is down to kernel implementation of how code gets executed.\r\n\r\nUsing `env -S` is also not helpful here, because as you can see in your debugging output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   arg[0]= ‘bash’\r\n   arg[1]= ‘-c’\r\n   arg[2]= ‘time /usr/bin/python3 -OO’\r\n   arg[3]= ‘./mypycheck.py’\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt runs shell, tells to run a command (`-c`) starting python wrapped in `time` and then passed `‘./mypycheck.py’` to bash (not python) as its last argument. meaning of which is (applying to the bash):\r\n\r\n&gt; `-c`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; If  the  `-c` option is present, then commands are read from the first non-option argument `command_string`.  If there are arguments after the `command_string`, the first argument is assigned to `$0` and any remaining arguments are assigned to the positional parameters.  The assignment to `$0` sets the name of the shell, which is used in warning\r\n and error messages.\r\n\r\nAs for you objective.

Thought you must note that it is stable only in version 11.x and up of NodeJs as of right now. I am using &gt;12.x.\r\n\r\nNow the rest of the process is rather straight forward assuming you are familiar with Async/Await and Promises. And if you&#39;re not I would highly suggest getting into it as it can save your day as it did with me.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a great tutorial regarding it: [Async/Await and Promise in JS][1]\r\n\r\nPs. Use the for loop instead of &#39;array.forEach(e =&gt; //Do Something);&#39; approach as it will again introduce the same problem as faced earlier because it is also callback-based!\r\n\r\nHope I helped you.

The item returned is also a Node, that has its own Next, that points to yet another item in the list. If you repeatedly call Next then you simply travel along the list\r\n\r\nThink of it as trying to find your child. You know he went to john’s house. You go to john’s house but are told “they went to paul’s house”, so you go to paul’s house and are told “they went to Sarah’s house”, so you go to Sarah’s house...\r\n\r\nAt each step you’re being sent to the Next house, but you’re not demolishing anyone’s house. You maintain a memory of where you are in the list of houses. If you went back to johns house and started over (the list head) you would travel the same route again\r\n\r\nIf you were to make a new variable pointing to the head of the list, and then repeatedly reassign it to Next, then you’re always changing the Node your temp variable is pointing to, but the list nodes themselves always stay pointing to each other too, and you don’t disturb their relationship:\r\n\r\n    var tempNode = list.Node; //tempNode is you, you’re at john’s house now\r\n    tempNode = tempNode.Next; //now you’re at paul’s house\r\n    tempNode = tempNode.Next; //now you’re at sarah’s \r\n\r\nAt no time did you disturb any of the existing nodes. What if, when you got to Paul’s house you said to Paul’s dad “if my wife comes asking, tell her my son went to Jane’s house” - this changes where Paul’s dad will point the next person to:\r\n\r\nvar tempNode = list.Node; //tempNode is you, you’re at john’s house now\r\n    tempNode = tempNode.Next; //now you’re at paul’s house\r\n    tempNode.Next = new Node(“Jane’s house”);\r\n\r\nNow we have actually manipulated the list and changed where the Next of the second node is pointing to\r\n\r\n    \r\n&gt; how does AddHead work?\r\n\r\nIt takes the data you pass in and makes a new Node out of it, then makes the new node&#39;s Next point to the existing list head and makes the existing list head point to the new node instead. This effectively makes the list grow  backwards by adding a new head all the time. If you wanted the houses to be visited in order of John, Paul, Sarah you&#39;d have to add them in order of `AddHead(Sarah), AddHead(Paul), AddHead(John)`\r\n\r\nThe list growth looks like:\r\n\r\n    head-&gt;nothing \r\n\r\n    head-&gt;Sarah\r\n\r\n    head-&gt;Paul-&gt;Sarah\r\n\r\n    head-&gt;John-&gt;Paul-&gt;Sarah\r\n\r\nI simplified the look of this, to hide Nodes and Next. Every arrow  `-&gt;` represents Next, every name is the Data inside a Node\r\n    \r\n\r\n&gt; how do I post code\r\n\r\nPut 3 back ticks on their own line, before and after the code block. Or prefix every line in the code with 4 or more spaces\r\n\r\n&gt; how should I name the question\r\n\r\nThat’s really for you to decide, as it helps us understand how you think as does the question body","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58144558/how-to-chain-objects-in-c/58144602#58144602","title":"How to chain Objects in C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12129521,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10162262908835510/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sher Ning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12129521/sher-ning"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12129521,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10162262908835510/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sher Ning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12129521/sher-ning"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569672009,"creation_date":1569658615,"last_edit_date":1569672009,"question_id":58144558,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58144558","body_markdown":"I have got 4 questions:\r\n\r\n1.

How do I post code inside a box for the forum, this is my first post, please forgive me.\r\n\r\nThank you !\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    \r\n    namespace GenericInterfaces\r\n    {\r\n        class Program\r\n        {\r\n            static void Main()\r\n            {\r\n                //Declare and instantiate a new generic SortedList class.\r\n                //Person is the type argument.\r\n                SortedList&lt;Person&gt; list = new SortedList&lt;Person&gt;();\r\n    \r\n                //Create name and age values to initialize Person objects.\r\n                string[] names = new string[]\r\n                {\r\n                &quot;Franscoise&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Bill&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Li&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Sandra&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Gunnar&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Alok&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Hiroyuki&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Maria&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Alessandro&quot;,\r\n                &quot;Raul&quot;\r\n                };\r\n    \r\n                int[] ages = new int[] { 45, 19, 28, 23, 18, 9, 108, 72, 30, 35 };\r\n    \r\n                //Populate the list with new Node Objects\r\n                for (int x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++)\r\n                {\r\n                    //ages[x] is integer\r\n                    list.AddHead(new Person(names[x],ages[x]));\r\n                }\r\n    \r\n                //Print out unsorted list.\r\n                foreach (var p in list)\r\n                {\r\n                    System.Console.Write(p.ToString() + &quot; &quot;);\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Unsorted Data&quot;);\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(list.head.Data);\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(list.head.Next.Data);\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(list.head.Next.Next.Data);\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(list.head.Next.Next.Next.Data);\r\n    \r\n                }\r\n                System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Done with unsorted list&quot;);\r\n    \r\n                  \r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;My Custom Class Experiment&quot;);\r\n                MyCustomClass cc = new MyCustomClass();\r\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; ages.Length; i++)\r\n                {\r\n                    cc.AddHead(ages[i]);\r\n                }\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Added ages to custom class&quot;);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.head.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.head.Next.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.head.Next.Next.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.head.Next.Next.Next.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.head.Next.Next.Next.Next.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.n.Data);\r\n                Console.WriteLine(cc.n.Next.Data);\r\n              \r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        //Type parameter T in angle brackets.\r\n        public class GenericList&lt;T&gt; : System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            public Node head;\r\n            public Node current = null;\r\n    \r\n            // Nested class is also generic on T\r\n            public class Node\r\n            {\r\n                public Node Next { get; set; } = null;\r\n                public T Data { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n                public Node(T t)  //T used in non-generic constructor\r\n                {\r\n                    Data = t;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            public GenericList()  //constructor\r\n            {\r\n                head = null;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            public void AddHead(T t)  //T as method parameter type\r\n            {\r\n                Node n = new Node(t);\r\n                n.Next = head;\r\n                head = n;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            // Implementation of the iterator\r\n            public System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator&lt;T&gt; GetEnumerator()\r\n            {\r\n                Node current = head;\r\n                while (current != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    yield return current.Data;\r\n                    current = current.Next;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            // IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; inherits from IEnumerable, therefore this class \r\n            // must implement both the generic and non-generic versions of \r\n            // GetEnumerator.
