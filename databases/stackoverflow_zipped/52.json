Notice that there are 4 possibilities, namely 5 =\r\n\r\n 1. 5\r\n 2. 2 + 2 + 1\r\n 3. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 4. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n\r\nNow try dividing 10 instead of 500.\r\nNotice that this can be split up into 11 different ways:\r\n10 = \r\n\r\n 1.  10\r\n 2.  5 + 5\r\n 3.  5 + 2 + 2 + 1\r\n 4.  5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 5.  5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 6.  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2\r\n 7.  2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1\r\n 8.  2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 9.  2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 10. 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n 11. 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1\r\n\r\nThis solution follows the following pattern:\r\nThe number x you want to split is already an answer.\r\nDecrease the amount of lowest numbers by 1 by splitting one of these numbers into as many next largest numbers as possible. Always ignore ones. If  there is only one number (and ones) left, split x into as many next lowest numbers as possible and continue.\r\n\r\nFor example, x = 10. Then: 10 is the lowest number -&gt; split it up into 5 + 5 -&gt; 5 is the lowest number -&gt;split it up into 2 + 2 + 1 -&gt; 2 is the lowest number since ones are ignored -&gt; split it up into 1 + 1 -&gt; we have another 2, split it up into 1 + 1 (this is equal to the solution 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 so now we have 5 as only one number apart from ones. Next lowest number is 2)-&gt; split x=10 into 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 -&gt; 2 is the lowest number; split it into 1 + 1 -&gt; we have another 2 ...\r\n\r\nThis can be done in an recursive approach.\r\n\r\n## Things that went wrong in your code ##\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nWhat you code does with the example of dividing 10 is the following:\r\n\r\n 1. 10 is divided into 5 + 5\r\n 2. the first 5 is divided into 2 + 2 + 1\r\n 3. one of these twos is divided into 1 + 1\r\n 4. the other two is divided into 1 + 1\r\n 5. Now, the second 5 from the division into 5 + 5 is divided into 2 + 2 + 1\r\n 6. One of these twos is divided into 1 + 1\r\n 7. The other two is divided into 1 + 1\r\n\r\nGiving it a total score of 7 possibilities.\r\nTrying to map These 7 possibilities to the 11 above, you count 10 =\r\n\r\n - 10 once\r\n - 5 + 5 once\r\n - 5 + 2 + 2 + 1 twice\r\n - 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 twice\r\n - 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 twice\r\n\r\nand missing the other 6 options. \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the assumption that this question can be solved by an approach like this one:\r\n\r\n10 = 5 + 5 -&gt; evaluate the first 5, then evaluate the second 5\r\n\r\nis wrong because in both cases this leads to a distribution of 10 = 5 + evaluation of 5, counting only the options where at least one 5 is contained in the final distribution of 10 (counting it multiple times whearas distributions without fives are not evaluated).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother mistake is that the code says there is no possible distribution of 1 where there actually exists one (1 = 1).\r\nAlso, the question is unclear about \r\n\r\n - can x equal all possible whole numbers? -&gt; 4 is not split up into 2 + 2 in your Code\r\n - is 1 + 1 + 2 a different solution from 1 + 2 + 1 and 2 + 1 + 1?\r\n\r\n(I don&#39;t have the reputation to ask this in a comment yet).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nRemaining an recursive approach can only be done with some significant changes. A possible way to do so is stated above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521142/recursive-approach-to-finding-out-all-the-ways-to-change-a-%e2%82%ac5-note/58525027#58525027","title":"Recursive approach to finding out all the ways to change a €5 note?"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":11481011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a2ae801a0fb587a81d7c6e69c504a08?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"drew181","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11481011/drew181"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571840543,"creation_date":1571827691,"question_id":58521142,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58521142","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been given a problem about finding all the possible combinations to change a 5 euro note.

You could ieven link with both lubraries, with the test version first, as linkers often resolve symbols in the order they are encountered.\r\n\r\nAnd, as you said, you could work with a bunch of `#ifdef`s, which would have the advantage of having just one .c file, but making tyhe code less readable.\r\n\r\nI would not go for `#ifdef`s on the function level, i.e. defining just one function of a .c file for test and keeping the others as is; however, if necessary, it could be away.

REFERENCES `staff` (`STAFFNO`));\r\n\r\nAnd I want to create a stored procedure called `sp_finish_campaign (in c_title varchar(30))` that takes a title of a campaign and finishes the campaign by updating the `CAMPAIGNFINISHDATE` to the current date and `ACTUALCOST` to the cost of the campaign, which is calculated from the number of hours different staff put into it on different dates, and the salary grade (this changes based on staffID and the timeframe based on the `STARTDATE` and `FINISHDATE` of the `staffongrade` table. \r\n\r\nTo calculate the `ACTUALCOST`, I created a helper function:\r\n\r\n    DELIMITER //\r\n\r\n    CREATE FUNCTION rate_on_date(staff_id int, given_date date)\r\n    \tRETURNS int\r\n        DETERMINISTIC\r\n    BEGIN\r\n    \tDECLARE salaryGrade int;\r\n        SET salaryGrade = (select grade from staffongrade\r\n        where staffno = staff_id AND (given_date BETWEEN STARTDATE AND FINISHDATE));\r\n    RETURN salaryGrade;\r\n    END //\r\n    DELIMITER ;\r\n\r\nWhich returns the pay `grade` based on the `staff_id` and `given_date` parameters I give it:\r\n\r\n`select rate_on_date(1, &quot;2018-02-02&quot;) as Grade_On_Date;`\r\n\r\n[![gradetable][1]][1]\r\n\r\nFor the parameters of this I assume I would have to get it from the `workson` table which looks like this:\r\n\r\n[![workson][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI have tried using a select statement to get the paygrade:\r\n\r\n`select hourlyrate as &#39;grade&#39; from salarygrade\r\nwhere rate_on_date(1, &quot;2018-02-02&quot;) = grade;`\r\n\r\n[![pay][3]][3]\r\n\r\nTo calculate `ACTUALCOST` I assume I would have to do a calculation by multiplying `HOUR` column with the grade costs, and use the `WDATE` and `STAFFNO` columns in the `workson` table as parameters for my stored procedure that will calculate and update the `CAMPAIGNFINISHDATE` and `ACTUALCOST` of the campaign by inputting the campaign title into it. \r\nBut how would I go about doing this?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just confused as to how to go about creating this procedure, and also confused about how to properly use these helper functions in my stored procedure. \r\nI feel like this question is quite long but I don&#39;t really know what to ask or what direction I should take to solve this problem. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZz7s.png\r\n

Would someone show some basic code of card view, and explain what it does?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521127/how-to-use-cardview","title":"How to use cardview?"},{"tags":["c#","imap","mailkit","mimekit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14132,"user_id":205233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcOJU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Filburt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205233/filburt"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571828142,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103367731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103367731_58521126"},{"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3881188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nQzj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theDarthVader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3881188/thedarthvader"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14132,"user_id":205233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcOJU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Filburt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205233/filburt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571828970,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103368168,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103368168_58521126"},{"owner":{"reputation":14132,"user_id":205233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcOJU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Filburt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205233/filburt"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571831285,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103369407,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103369407_58521126"},{"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3881188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nQzj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theDarthVader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3881188/thedarthvader"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571833503,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103370714,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103370714_58521126"},{"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3881188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nQzj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theDarthVader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3881188/thedarthvader"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14132,"user_id":205233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcOJU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Filburt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205233/filburt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571834120,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103371039,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103371039_58521126"},{"owner":{"reputation":14132,"user_id":205233,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RcOJU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Filburt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205233/filburt"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571841663,"post_id":58521126,"comment_id":103375574,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521126/is-there-any-way-to-fetch-mailmessages-from-imap-server-using-mailkit-and-save-t#comment103375574_58521126"}],"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3881188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nQzj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theDarthVader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3881188/thedarthvader"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97,"user_id":3881188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":31,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4nQzj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"theDarthVader","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3881188/thedarthvader"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571833952,"creation_date":1571827638,"last_edit_date":1571833952,"question_id":58521126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58521126","body_markdown":"I need to fetch all E-Mails from IMAP server and save all messages to hard disk.

\r\n&gt; In the above example, the handler will only be called if $event.key is\r\n&gt; equal to &#39;PageDown&#39;.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n[1]: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html#Key-Modifiers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521117/how-to-use-keyboard-buttons-to-manipulate-numbers/58521174#58521174","title":"How to use keyboard buttons to manipulate numbers"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":1680375,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jho37.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matej Svajger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1680375/matej-svajger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571836718,"creation_date":1571836718,"answer_id":58523813,"question_id":58521117,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58523813","body_markdown":"If you want to listen for global keyboard events you&#39;ll need to add the listener to the window, otherwise you need focus on element that the event is dispatched from.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s just plain vanila js from there:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: null --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    new Vue({\r\n      el: &quot;#app&quot;,\r\n      data: {\r\n        one: 1\r\n      },\r\n      created() {\r\n        const component = this;\r\n        this.handler = function (e) {\r\n          e.keyCode == 38 &amp;&amp;

The user opens three workbooks (dashboard, source and target). In the dashboard workbook the user then inputs the names of the source and target workbooks - so for instance &quot;source.xls&quot; and &quot;target.xlsm&quot;. These inputs are defined as ranged names called &quot;FILE_SOURCE&quot; and &quot;FILE_TARGET&quot;.\r\n\r\nAs such, I use the range names to define my workbook variables as in the following:\r\n\r\n    Dim sourceModel, targetModel As String\r\n    sourceModel = wbMainDashboard.Range(&quot;FILE_SOURCE&quot;) &#39;Pull from dashboard input (works)\r\n    targetModel = wbMainDashboard.Range(&quot;FILE_TARGET&quot;) &#39;Pull from dashboard input (works)\r\n\r\n    &#39;Source and target workbooks\r\n    Dim wbSource As Workbook: Set wbSource = Workbooks(sourceModel) &#39;Workbook already open (doesn&#39;t work)\r\n    Dim wbTarget As Workbook: Set wbTarget = Workbooks(targetModel) &#39;Workbook already open (doesn&#39;t work)\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly fine when the source and target workbooks are both saved on the desktop but for some reason it doesn&#39;t work when they are saved on the drives on my computer. As such, I was thinking that I may have to specify the full path location of the source and target workbooks in order to define the wbSource and wbTarget variables?\r\n\r\nIn order to do this I tried to implement the following function which should return the file paths:\r\n\r\n    Public Function GetWorkbookReference(ByVal sFullName As String) As Workbook\r\n    \r\n    Dim wbReturn As Workbook\r\n\r\n    Set wbReturn = Workbooks(Dir$(sFullName))\r\n    Set GetWorkbookReference = wbReturn\r\n    \r\n    End Function\r\n\r\nAfter which I wanted to call this function when defining the wbSource and wbTarget variables:\r\n\r\n    Dim wbSource As Workbook: Set wbSource = GetWorkbookReference(sourceModel) &#39;Workbook already open (doesn&#39;t work)\r\n    Dim wbTarget As Workbook: Set wbTarget = GetWorkbookReference(targetModel) &#39;Workbook already open (doesn&#39;t work)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this doesn&#39;t work either. If anyone can assist in figuring out why either of these to alternatives doesn&#39;t work that would be very helpful. If you know of a third alternative that would be much appreciated as well.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521107/setting-workbook-with-variable-name","title":"Setting workbook with variable name"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571827676,"post_id":58521105,"comment_id":103367507,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521105/c-custom-groupby-taking-more-time-for-large-dataset#comment103367507_58521105"},{"owner":{"reputation":4595,"user_id":1672994,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56278338c1a328fee5a80471a18bfc82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1672994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1672994/user1672994"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571827877,"post_id":58521105,"comment_id":103367618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521105/c-custom-groupby-taking-more-time-for-large-dataset#comment103367618_58521105"},{"owner":{"reputation":16181,"user_id":150967,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91e55968cae0db7346488a42abc42f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gsharp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/150967/gsharp"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571827919,"post_id":58521105,"comment_id":103367631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521105/c-custom-groupby-taking-more-time-for-large-dataset#comment103367631_58521105"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11646070,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdc7ab87fde840335dd082e5664c25c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"st1612","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11646070/st1612"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571828492,"post_id":58521235,"comment_id":103367897,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521105/c-custom-groupby-taking-more-time-for-large-dataset/58521235#comment103367897_58521235"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4595,"user_id":1672994,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56278338c1a328fee5a80471a18bfc82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1672994","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1672994/user1672994"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571828037,"creation_date":1571828037,"answer_id":58521235,"question_id":58521105,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58521235","body_markdown":"You are selecting `InnerList` from non-grouped collection i.e. `result` that&#39;s why your query is taking time.

A : A\r\n    type R&lt;A&gt; = A\r\n\r\nwould solve it.  \r\n\r\nActually I see you changed `R&lt;A&gt;` in another part of your code to be essentially `Extract&lt;A, Bottom&gt;`.  In some instances, `Extract&lt;T, U&gt;` can be replaced by the intersection `T &amp; U` without ill effects; you might try that instead:\r\n\r\n    // type R&lt;A&gt; = A extends Bottom ? A : never\r\n    type R&lt;A&gt; = A &amp; Bottom\r\n\r\nThat might also work.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, hope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/index.html#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)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521104/typescript-custom-restriction-with-generics/58527491#58527491","title":"Typescript custom restriction with Generics"}],"owner":{"reputation":1720,"user_id":1155168,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb007ea9916e45856033ffe97f8843ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Iazel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1155168/iazel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571848819,"creation_date":1571827557,"question_id":58521104,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58521104","body_markdown":"While working on a library, I discovered what to me looks like a bug when using Generics:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntype R&lt;A&gt; = A extends Bottom ?

According to the [documentation](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/22653.active-directory-ambiguous-name-resolution.aspx), it will expand a search term like `(anr=Smith)` to something like this:\r\n\r\n    (|(displayName=smith*)(givenName=smith*)(legacyExchangeDN=smith)(physicalDeliveryOfficeName=smith*)(proxyAddresses=smith*)(Name=smith*)(sAMAccountName=smith*)(sn=smith*))\r\n\r\nNotice that it already does a &quot;starts with&quot; type search. Putting your own wildcards in there messes it up.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, it&#39;s the asterisk at the beginning. I tested this in our own AD environment. If I search for `(anr=*Gabriel*)` or `(anr=*Gabriel)`, I get no results. If I search for `(anr=Gabriel*)` I get results, but it really has no effect on the results (the results are the same as if I had searched for `(anr=Gabriel)`).\r\n\r\nThe solution is to change that line to this:\r\n\r\n    user.Anr = searchterm\r\n\r\nIt is not exactly equivalent to the &quot;contains&quot; search you seem to want, but putting a wildcard at the beginning of any search really kills performance anyway.

The same why, when I compute `NumberOfStudentsEvaluating`, I want to indicate the total number of students participated in the evaluation until that day. \r\n\r\nOne approach to achieve this could be to iterate through the `result` object and compute these properties again:\r\n\r\n     foreach (var i in result)\r\n     {\r\n         i.AverageScore = result.Where(r =&gt; r.DateCreated &lt;= i.DateCreated).Select(r =&gt; r.AverageScore).Average(),\r\n\r\n     }\r\n\r\nBut, this is quite costly. I wonder if it is possible to tweak the code a bit to achieve this, or should I start from scratch with another approach.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521075/using-groupby-to-compute-average-or-count-based-on-the-whole-data-until-the-corr","title":"Using GroupBy to compute average or count based on the whole data until the corresponding date"},{"tags":["android","admob"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1170,"user_id":3522570,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000351746269/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ganesh Pokale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3522570/ganesh-pokale"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571833477,"post_id":58521073,"comment_id":103370695,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58521073/using-multiple-ad-networks-in-admob-ad-requests#comment103370695_58521073"}],"owner":{"reputation":263,"user_id":6655405,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HDogR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stelios Papamichail","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6655405/stelios-papamichail"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571827450,"creation_date":1571827450,"question_id":58521073,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58521073","body_markdown":"I just registered on AdColony and implemented their SDK into my app in order to add the AdColony network in my AdMob mediation group&#39;s Waterfall Ad Sources.

You’re probably concerned about your use of `DispatchQueue.main.sync` but the way you are using it is the only way one would ever use it — you need to get on and off the main queue but you mustn’t block the main queue if you’re already on it. \r\n\r\nIf there’s anything I’d question it’s why you need to push this logic down to this method. The implication  is that this method can itself be called indiscriminately from different queues, which suggests a failure of logic or structure higher up the calling chain. Testing for what queue you’re on is arguably a bad smell and not, itself, thread-safe; you should always know what queue you’re on because each method should always be called on the same queue.

i &lt; Loop_Count ; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            if((i != 0) &amp;&amp; (i != 4) &amp;&amp; ( j == 0 || j == 4 ))\r\n            {\r\n                digitalWrite(Led_Row_Pins[i],state);//    Led_On_State\r\n                digitalWrite(Led_Column_Pins[j],!state);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nFor a more general solution you have to loop over the rows, activate one row after the other and switch the column pins as necessary for the current row.\r\n~~~\r\n#define MAXLEDS 5\r\nint states[MAXLEDS][MAXLEDS] = {\r\n    { 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 },\r\n    { 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },\r\n    { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },\r\n    { 0, 1, 0, 1, 0 },\r\n    { 1, 0, 0, 0, 1 }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid switch_leds(int row) {\r\n    int i;\r\n\r\n    /* switch off all rows */\r\n    for(i = 0;

Using Ajax call.\r\n\r\nUsing Ajax call, First I have called my API to fetch file blob from the server and after that creating URL for that blob and giving it to anchor tag to download this.\r\n\r\nIt is working fine but the issue here is Ajax call first download content in the background before giving it to anchor tag. So It is difficult to explain the user, where it is taking time.\r\n\r\nCode is here:- \r\n\r\n     var URL = $window.URL || $window.webkitURL || $window.mozURL || $window.msURL;\r\n                if (URL) {\r\n                    // IE10+\r\n                    if (navigator.msSaveBlob) {\r\n                        return navigator.msSaveOrOpenBlob(fileBlob, fileName);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        var downloadLink = document.createElement(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n                        downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;style&#39;, &quot;display: none&quot;);\r\n                        downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;href&#39;, URL.createObjectURL(fileBlob));\r\n                        downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;download&#39;, fileName);\r\n                        document.body.appendChild(downloadLink);\r\n                        downloadLink.click();\r\n                        setTimeout(function () {\r\n                            document.body.removeChild(downloadLink);\r\n                        }, 10);\r\n    \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n2. Directly anchor tag is downloading the file:-\r\n\r\nIn this approach, I am just giving API URL in anchor tag href, so it is downloading my file fast and after API response, the user can see the download progress in his browser. but In this approch I am not able to handle server error like server restarted or file not found. Anchor tag downloading HTML file if API failed.\r\n\r\nI can handle the success case by using cookies but not able to handle error case.\r\n\r\nHere is code for this approach:- \r\n\r\n     var downloadLink = document.createElement(&#39;a&#39;);\r\n                downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;style&#39;, &quot;display: none&quot;);\r\n                downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;href&#39;, `/download?id=${id}`);\r\n                downloadLink.setAttribute(&#39;download&#39;, fileName);\r\n                document.body.appendChild(downloadLink);\r\n                downloadLink.click();\r\n                setTimeout(function () {\r\n                    document.body.removeChild(downloadLink);\r\n                }, 10);\r\n\r\nAll in all, I want to improve download speed for big files.\r\n\r\nQuestions:-\r\n\r\n1. Possible ways to handle the error if I use second approach. \r\n\r\n2. If I use the first approch then content should be download on the user browser not in the background.\r\n\r\n3. How to solve the latency issue if the user is in a different region?\r\n\r\nI hope my issue is clear, Please let me know if anything is not clear.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520993/big-file-download-from-server-using-javascript","title":"Big File Download From Server Using Javascript"},{"tags":["oracle","database-performance","sql-tuning"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":205395,"user_id":14955,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5DblQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Thilo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/14955/thilo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571827619,"creation_date":1571827619,"answer_id":58521120,"question_id":58520991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58521120","body_markdown":"A UNION has to remove duplicates, which is expensive.

This combines the input tables and returns all the rows.\r\n\r\n`UNION` combines the input tables. Then returns the *distinct* rows. \r\n\r\nSo `UNION` has an extra sort/distinct operation compared to `CONCATENATION`. How big this effect is depends on your data set.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll see `CONCATENATION` when the optimizer does an OR expansion. But note that from Oracle Database 12.2, [this has changed][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; * CONCATENATION is replaced with UNION-ALL.\r\n&gt; * Each UNION-ALL branch can be subject to further query transformations, if applicable. This is not possible with\r\n&gt; CONCATENATION.\r\n&gt; * Parallel queries can execute UNION-ALL branches concurrently. Again, this is not possible with CONCATENATION.\r\n\r\nSo `UNION-ALL` can come up with better plans for each operation below it. And run these at the same (if using parallel). So in many cases this will be faster than `CONCATENATION`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer/optimizer-transformations:-or-expansion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520991/what-is-the-difference-between-the-union-and-concatenation-operators-in-terms-of/58521668#58521668","title":"What is the difference between the UNION and CONCATENATION operators in terms of performance?"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":2761145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da67e643e0bd09c68c9e31d2c3e56e5a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"general46","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2761145/general46"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58521668,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571829521,"creation_date":1571827147,"question_id":58520991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58520991","body_markdown":"Sometimes, it can be seen CONCATENATION step in the Explain Plan. \r\n\r\nI wonder what is the difference between union and concatenation operators in terms of performance tuning?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520991/what-is-the-difference-between-the-union-and-concatenation-operators-in-terms-of","title":"What is the difference between the UNION and CONCATENATION operators in terms of performance?"},{"tags":["sql","entity-framework","asp.net-core","iis","sql-server-express"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3916,"user_id":392957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6282692873bfc333c11978e79cef723a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tony Abrams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392957/tony-abrams"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571827567,"post_id":58520988,"comment_id":103367441,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520988/publish-net-core-app-with-entity-framework-to-iis#comment103367441_58520988"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12063516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b8be508de660b6d812106b7fd76354d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louise Helena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063516/louise-helena"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3916,"user_id":392957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6282692873bfc333c11978e79cef723a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tony Abrams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/392957/tony-abrams"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571828404,"post_id":58520988,"comment_id":103367864,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520988/publish-net-core-app-with-entity-framework-to-iis#comment103367864_58520988"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12063516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b8be508de660b6d812106b7fd76354d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louise Helena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063516/louise-helena"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571828201,"post_id":58521115,"comment_id":103367769,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520988/publish-net-core-app-with-entity-framework-to-iis/58521115#comment103367769_58521115"},{"owner":{"reputation":1568,"user_id":8048748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1674282325934326/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tiago Silva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8048748/tiago-silva"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12063516,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b8be508de660b6d812106b7fd76354d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louise Helena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12063516/louise-helena"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571832089,"post_id":58521115,"comment_id":103369897,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58520988/publish-net-core-app-with-entity-framework-to-iis/58521115#comment103369897_58521115"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1568,"user_id":8048748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1674282325934326/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tiago Silva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8048748/tiago-silva"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571827599,"creation_date":1571827599,"answer_id":58521115,"question_id":58520988,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58521115","body_markdown":"How did you created your database locally in the first place?
