Haskell&#39;s records are just a way to define accessor functions for ADT fields. For example the following two types are almost equivalent:\r\n\r\n    data A = A Int String\r\n    data B = B { x :: Int, y :: String }\r\n\r\nExcept that type `B` comes with predefined accessor functions `x :: B -&gt; Int` and `y :: B -&gt; String`.\r\n\r\nPureScript, on the other hand, had real, ad-hoc, polymorphic, extensible records that are a thing onto themselves. A record in PureScript is defined like this:\r\n\r\n    { x :: Int, y :: String }\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s right, there is no need for `data` or anything. Record are just ad-hoc, sort of like tuples in Haskell. For example:\r\n\r\n    getX :: { x :: Int, y :: String } -&gt; Int\r\n    getX r = r.x\r\n\r\nOf course, if you like, you can declare an alias for your record, just like you can do with any other type:\r\n\r\n    type XY = { x :: Int, y :: String }\r\n\r\n    getX :: XY -&gt; Int\r\n    getX = r.x\r\n\r\nYou can also use a record as a member of an ADT - again, just like any other type:\r\n\r\n    data XYWrapped = XYWrapped { x :: Int, y :: String }\r\n\r\nBut if you do that, you&#39;d need to unwrap the ADT via pattern matching in order to get the record. Again, just like with any other type:\r\n\r\n    getXWrapped :: XYWrapped -&gt; Int\r\n    getXWrapped (XYWrapped r) = r.x\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re not limited to wrapping just one record either (you guessed it: just like with any other type):\r\n\r\n    data XYPQ = XYPQ { x :: Int, y :: String } { p :: Char, q :: Int }\r\n\r\n    getXPlusQ :: XYPQ -&gt; Int\r\n    getXPlusQ (XYPQ a b) = a.x + b.q\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nArmed with this knowledge, you can now see that your types `Point` and `Rect` are not, in fact, records, but rather ADTs that _wrap_ a single record (and because of this they should be `newtype`s). \r\n\r\nThis is why you&#39;re getting type mismatch. Because you wrote `r.upperLeft`, the compiler has inferred that `r` must be a record that contains a field named `upperLeft`, but your type signature says that `r` is of type `Rect`, which is not a record at all. So the compiler complains.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you can either redefine your types as actual records:\r\n\r\n    type Point = {\r\n      x :: Int,\r\n      y :: Int\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    type Rect = {\r\n      upperLeft :: Point,\r\n      upperRight :: Point,\r\n      lowerLeft :: Point,\r\n      lowerRight :: Point\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr you can have your function unwrap the ADTs:\r\n\r\n    rectsOverlap (Rect r) (Rect s) = \r\n        let (Point rUpperRight) = r.upperRight\r\n            (Point rUpperLeft) = r.upperLeft\r\n        ....\r\n\r\nwhich would be kinda tedious.

Python environment creation from anaconda by `pyenv` is still handled by `pyenv virtualenv` but not `conda env create`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been using these two tools together. It turns out the best solution is to install `conda`, `pyenv` separately, and manage their virtual environments separately as well.\r\n\r\n1. alway initialize `pyenv`\r\n2. only expose command `conda` but don&#39;t activate any environment\r\n\r\n### Detail\r\nInstall `pyenv`. \r\n\r\nInstall Anaconda or Miniconda normally, NOT by `pyenv install`.\r\n\r\nMake sure the `pyenv` and `conda` commands are available in an interactive shell.\r\n\r\nInitialize `pyenv` by putting following content into shell init file (`.bashrc` for Bash, `.zshrc` for ZSH).\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Put the content into ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile for Bash,\r\n# .zshrc for ZSH\r\n\r\n# you may need to add dir of command `pyenv` into PATH,\r\n# if command pyenv is not available yet\r\n\r\nif command -v pyenv &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then\r\n    eval &quot;$(pyenv init -)&quot;\r\nfi\r\nif command -v pyenv-virtualenv &amp;&gt;/dev/null; then\r\n    eval &quot;$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)&quot;\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpose command `conda` but don&#39;t activate any environment, even the `base` environment. Execute the following commands in your shell.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Run the content in the shell\r\n\r\n# init conda, the following command write scripts into your shell init file automatically\r\nconda init\r\n\r\n# disable init of env &quot;base&quot;\r\nconda config --set auto_activate_base false\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: After this setup, the default python is the one set by `pyenv global`. Use `pyenv` and `conda` to manage environments separately.\r\n\r\nExamples of managing virtual environments.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# virtual environments from pyenv\r\npyenv install 3.6.9\r\npyenv virtualenv 3.6.9 new-env\r\npyenv activate new-env\r\npyenv deactive\r\n# You can also use `pyenv local`\r\n\r\n\r\n# virtual environments from conda\r\nconda env create new-env python=3.6\r\nconda env list\r\nconda activate new-env\r\nconda deactivate\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault env location for `pyenv` is `~/.pyenv/versions`. \r\n\r\nDefault env location for `conda`, check output from `conda info`.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- [pyenv installation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)\r\n- [pyenv virtualenv installatoin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv#installation)\r\n- [How do I prevent Conda from activating the base environment by default?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57974390/5101148)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044214/installing-anaconda-with-pyenv-unable-to-configure-virtual-environment/58045893#58045893","title":"Installing anaconda with pyenv, unable to configure virtual environment"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12100708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e827652b46d7011e7ccf1f0dc3c9a3f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max Lyons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100708/max-lyons"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12100708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e827652b46d7011e7ccf1f0dc3c9a3f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max Lyons","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100708/max-lyons"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":87,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58045893,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569308220,"creation_date":1569100853,"last_edit_date":1569210474,"question_id":58044214,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58044214","body_markdown":"I am using pyenv to manage python installations and virtual environments - and I would like anaconda to be one such installation, and to be able to create virtual environments using anaconda python.

Is there a way to configure anaconda to behave properly under pyenv?\r\n\r\n#Update:#\r\nI uninstalled my pyenv-managed anaconda and did a fresh install as per Simba&#39;s recommendation.

Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nthanks, russ\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhwEl.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/7xVeq.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044210/reposition-image-in-timageviewer","title":"Reposition image in TImageViewer"},{"tags":["python","algorithm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10528,"user_id":37231,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8c52d89d43f28ca1195e6409a5280361?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdigital","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/37231/jdigital"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569101710,"post_id":58044209,"comment_id":102488796,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044209/how-to-find-if-a-word-is-in-a-string-fast-python#comment102488796_58044209"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":12043501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa5045d75e636ba5794fda1491b6b0ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"conditionalMethod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12043501/conditionalmethod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569108458,"post_id":58044209,"comment_id":102489711,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044209/how-to-find-if-a-word-is-in-a-string-fast-python#comment102489711_58044209"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6353,"user_id":2162212,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29317094ee28cae6e61311c8f7192633?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mucio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2162212/mucio"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569101934,"creation_date":1569101934,"answer_id":58044311,"question_id":58044209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58044311","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t really see another solution, but you could simplify your code with:\r\n\r\n    dictionary_of_words = [&quot;I&quot;, &quot;Stack&quot;, &quot;overflow&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &#39;etc&#39;]\r\n    AllDomains = [&quot;stackoverflow.com&quot;, &quot;iLikeStackoverflow.com&quot;, &#39;etc&#39;]\r\n    \r\n    # this is just to be sure they have the same case\r\n    dictionary_of_words = list(map(str.lower, dictionary_of_words))\r\n    AllDomains = list(map(str.lower, AllDomains))\r\n    \r\n    for word in dictionary_of_words:\r\n        matches = [domain for domain in AllDomains if word in domain]\r\n        print(word, matches)\r\n\r\nI have added the conversion to lower case just to have more matches with the sample data, not sure if this is necessary for you, but domain names are always lower case.\r\n\r\nAlso 600000 is a lot of words, are you sure that there are no duplicates there?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044209/how-to-find-if-a-word-is-in-a-string-fast-python/58044311#58044311","title":"How to find if a word is in a string - FAST, python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12058289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fd575bbe580150444b9ae64eac33cba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tyrion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12058289/tyrion"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12058289,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fd575bbe580150444b9ae64eac33cba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tyrion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12058289/tyrion"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569335133,"last_edit_date":1569335133,"creation_date":1569112544,"answer_id":58045162,"question_id":58044209,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58045162","body_markdown":"My solution is to mix all the domains into a large text soup.

This [post][1] was helpful. This is from the answer.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to synchronize (not add), even if you want set new values as `NULL` you have to use `include(&quot;EntityName&quot;)` on your db context. Now my save/update repository code is: \r\n\r\n        public void Save(PushTemplate pushTemplate)\r\n        {\r\n            if (pushTemplate.PushTemplateId == 0)\r\n            {\r\n                _applicationContext.PushTemplates.Add(pushTemplate);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                PushTemplate dbEntity = _applicationContext.PushTemplates\r\n                    .Include(x =&gt; x.Messages)\r\n                    .FirstOrDefault(x =&gt; x.PushTemplateId == pushTemplate.PushTemplateId);\r\n                \r\n                dbEntity.Messages = pushTemplate.Messages;\r\n                \r\n            }\r\n\r\n            _applicationContext.SaveChanges();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n \r\nAs you can see I just use `Include()`.

One `PushTemplate` can have many `PushTemplateMessage`s. I have repositories for this. All works for the create operation. But problem starts when I try to update `PushTemplate` and set new text for messages. Insetad of an update I see new one `PushTemplateMessage`. I&#39;ll show my code. \r\n\r\nEntity `PushTemplate`: \r\n\r\n    public class PushTemplate\r\n    {\r\n        public int PushTemplateId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Required]\r\n        public List&lt;PushTemplateMessage&gt; Messages { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public DateTime CreatedAt { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public PushTemplate()\r\n        {\r\n            CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow;\r\n        }\r\n    }  \r\n\r\nEntity `PushTemplateMessage`: \r\n\r\n    public class PushTemplateMessage\r\n    {\r\n        public int PushTemplateMessageId { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public string PushTitle { get; set; }\r\n        public string PushMessage { get; set; }\r\n        public PushTemplate PushTemplate { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRepository `PushTemplateRepository`: \r\n\r\n    public class PushTemplateRepository : IPushTemplateRepository\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly ApplicationDbContext _applicationContext;\r\n\r\n        public PushTemplateRepository(ApplicationDbContext applicationContext)\r\n        {\r\n            _applicationContext = applicationContext;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IQueryable&lt;PushTemplate&gt; PushTemplates =&gt; _applicationContext.PushTemplates;\r\n\r\n        public void Save(PushTemplate pushTemplate)\r\n        {\r\n            if (pushTemplate.PushTemplateId == 0)\r\n            {\r\n                _applicationContext.PushTemplates.Add(pushTemplate);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                PushTemplate dbEntity = _applicationContext.PushTemplates.Find(pushTemplate.PushTemplateId);\r\n\r\n                dbEntity.Messages = new List&lt;PushTemplateMessage&gt;();\r\n                 \r\n                _applicationContext.SaveChanges();\r\n                \r\n                dbEntity.Messages = pushTemplate.Messages;\r\n                \r\n            }\r\n\r\n            _applicationContext.SaveChanges();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDatabase context: \r\n\r\n    public class ApplicationDbContext : IdentityDbContext\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly string _connectionString;\r\n\r\n        public DbSet&lt;PushTemplate&gt; PushTemplates { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet&lt;PushTemplateMessage&gt; TemplateMessages { get; set; }\r\n        public ApplicationDbContext(IConfiguration configuration)\r\n        {\r\n            _connectionString = configuration.GetConnectionString(&quot;MakeAppDb&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            optionsBuilder.UseNpgsql(_connectionString, b =&gt; b.MigrationsAssembly(&quot;MakeAppPushesNet_2&quot;));\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);\r\n            \r\n            modelBuilder.Entity&lt;PushTemplate&gt;()\r\n                .HasMany(x =&gt; x.Messages)\r\n                .WithOne(y =&gt; y.PushTemplate)\r\n                .OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd finally call to update operation from my controller:\r\n\r\n    PushTemplate pushTemplate = new PushTemplate\r\n    {\r\n            Messages = pushTemplateMessages // new list of messages\r\n    }; \r\n\r\n    _pushTemplateRepository.Save(pushTemplate);\r\n\r\nAfter this operation I have the old `PushTemplateMessage` and new version of `PushTemplateMessage`. But I need only new one! As you can see, in the repository I have tried to &#39;clean&#39; old `PushTemplateMessage`s to set then new list. But it continues to merge old data with new!

For logging in I have a razor page: Login where it simply prompts the user for their Username and Password which should be in my sql server and validated.  Once it checks that the valid user flag is correct I want to create the session and send the user to Index for now.  Then in Index I want to see if the session has been created and I want to read the value within the session and display it onto the Index view to confirm that the user info has been captured.  \r\nMy Login.cs file looks like this: \r\n```\r\n public ActionResult OnPost(string UserName, string Password)\r\n        {\r\n            \r\n            if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n            {\r\n                return Page();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if(accountService.ValidateUserLogin(UserName, Password) == 1)\r\n            {\r\n\r\n                string Email = accountService.UsernameGetEmail(UserName);\r\n                HttpContext.Session.SetString(Email, TempData[&quot;email&quot;].ToString());\r\n                return RedirectToPage(&quot;/Index&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                //report error to user\r\n                return Page();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThis is where I try to capture the session info in my Index.cs page:\r\n```\r\npublic void OnGet()\r\n        {\r\n            if (HttpContext.Session.Id != null)\r\n            {\r\n                SessionEmail = HttpContext.Session.GetString(&quot;Email&quot;);\r\n                ViewData[&quot;SessionEmail&quot;] = SessionEmail;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nThis is the piece of html where I try to display that SessionEmail onto the view but it is null upon initialization of SessionEmail inside the index.cs file.\r\n```\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n    @{ \r\n        if( ViewData[&quot;SessionEmail&quot;] != null)\r\n        {\r\n        &lt;p&gt; Hello! @ViewData[&quot;SessionEmail&quot;].ToString() &lt;/p&gt;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nHopefully you can point out my mistakes here and how I try to set up a session. After I am able to set up a session I am going to edit my layout&#39;s navbar so that it will change if a user is signed in or not so maybe if you can point out how I can go about this with sessions that would be great, perhaps: httpcontext.session.IsAvailable? Also, I do have addSession and useSession in my startup as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044178/sessions-not-being-saved-when-when-being-created-with-net-core","title":"Sessions not being saved when when being created with .Net Core"},{"tags":["asp.net","asp.net-mvc","validation"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569104029,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102489117,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102489117_58044177"},{"owner":{"reputation":699,"user_id":5480887,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-F2BLexXSVww/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/Da6YvFObHXI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abolfazl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5480887/abolfazl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569133552,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102492554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102492554_58044177"},{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569136112,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102492956,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102492956_58044177"},{"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":549722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/670708044a91e680937ee2decf464e80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HomeMade","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549722/homemade"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569146972,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102495002,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102495002_58044177"},{"owner":{"reputation":30801,"user_id":5947043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jUK37.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ADyson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5947043/adyson"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569227554,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102514056,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102514056_58044177"},{"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":549722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/670708044a91e680937ee2decf464e80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HomeMade","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549722/homemade"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569244464,"post_id":58044177,"comment_id":102522878,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044177/is-custom-server-side-validation-in-asp-net-mvc-automatically-transferred-to-cli#comment102522878_58044177"}],"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":549722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/670708044a91e680937ee2decf464e80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HomeMade","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549722/homemade"},"last_editor":{"reputation":139,"user_id":549722,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/670708044a91e680937ee2decf464e80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HomeMade","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/549722/homemade"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569147434,"creation_date":1569100529,"last_edit_date":1569147434,"question_id":58044177,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58044177","body_markdown":"I have to add validation to an ASP.NET MVC project, I&#39;m doing some basic validation of a form for textboxes and radio buttons.

You just need to use it to (re)open `/dev/tty` as `stdin`. `/dev/tty` is a special file referring to the terminal that started the program.\r\n\r\nFrom [the manual page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/freopen.3p.html):\r\n\r\n&gt;  The `freopen()` function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by `pathname` and associates the stream pointed to by `stream` with it. The original stream (if it exists) is closed.  The `mode` argument is used just as in the `fopen()` function.\r\n\r\n&gt; [...]\r\n\r\n&gt; **The primary use of the `freopen()` function is to change the file associated with a standard text stream (`stderr`, `stdin`, or `stdout`)**.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    FILE *tty;\r\n    \r\n\ttty = freopen(&quot;/dev/tty&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, stdin);\r\n\tif (tty == NULL) {\r\n\t\tperror(&quot;Unable to open terminal for reading&quot;);\r\n\t\texit(1);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;Enter a letter to search for in the text: &quot;);\r\n\r\n    // Now scanf will read from the console where the process started.\r\n    scanf(&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;letter);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy the way, your program has some issues. You could read past the end of your `text` array, you don&#39;t correctly terminate it with a NUL character, and you also don&#39;t check for errors.

Yeah almost certainly, but that&#39;s little reason not to give the options for someone to manage their history (to say nothing of add-ons, plugins, modules that make the prompt better, etc.).\r\n\r\nFor example `posh-git`, as a consequence of updating the prompt to show git status must run git commands in the background.

It makes more sense to use `screen.ontimer()`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my rewrite of your code that I believe does what you desire:\r\n\r\n    from turtle import Screen, Turtle\r\n    from random import randint\r\n    \r\n    WIDTH, HEIGHT = 800, 600\r\n    FONT = (&quot;Courier&quot;, 24, &quot;normal&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    # end game\r\n    def end():\r\n    \tglobal alive\r\n    \r\n    \tscreen.bgcolor(&#39;white&#39;)\r\n    \tpen.write(&quot;You touched a box!&quot;, align=&quot;center&quot;, font=FONT)\r\n    \talive = False\r\n    \r\n    \tscreen.update()\r\n    \r\n    # collision\r\n    def check_collision():\r\n    \tscreen.update()\r\n    \r\n    \tfor enemy in enemies:\r\n    \t\tif player.distance(enemy) &lt; 20:\r\n    \t\t\tend()\r\n    \t\t\tbreak\r\n    \r\n    # player movement\r\n    def p_up():\r\n    \tplayer.sety(player.ycor() + 20)\r\n    \tcheck_collision()\r\n    \r\n    def p_down():\r\n    \tplayer.sety(player.ycor() - 20)\r\n    \tcheck_collision()\r\n    \r\n    def p_right():\r\n    \tplayer.setx(player.xcor() + 20)\r\n    \tcheck_collision()\r\n    \r\n    def p_left():\r\n    \tplayer.setx(player.xcor() - 20)\r\n    \tcheck_collision()\r\n    \r\n    # main loop\r\n    def move():\r\n    \r\n    \tfor enemy in enemies:\r\n    \t\tif enemy.ycor() &lt; -300:\r\n    \t\t\tenemy.hideturtle()\r\n    \t\t\tenemy.goto(randint(-400, 400), 300)\r\n    \t\t\tenemy.velocity = randint(4, 8)\r\n    \t\t\tenemy.showturtle()\r\n    \t\telse:\r\n    \t\t\tenemy.sety(enemy.ycor() - enemy.velocity)\r\n    \r\n    \t\tcheck_collision()\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif not alive:\r\n    \t\t\tbreak\r\n    \r\n    \tif alive:\r\n    \t\tscreen.ontimer(move, 50)\r\n    \r\n    alive = True\r\n    \r\n    screen = Screen()\r\n    screen.bgcolor(&#39;Black&#39;)\r\n    screen.setup(WIDTH, HEIGHT)\r\n    screen.tracer(False)\r\n    \r\n    # player\r\n    player = Turtle()\r\n    player.shape(&#39;square&#39;)\r\n    player.color(&#39;blue&#39;)\r\n    player.penup()\r\n    \r\n    # enemy\r\n    enemy_prototype = Turtle()\r\n    enemy_prototype.hideturtle()\r\n    enemy_prototype.shape(&#39;square&#39;)\r\n    enemy_prototype.color(&#39;red&#39;)\r\n    enemy_prototype.penup()\r\n    \r\n    enemies = []\r\n    \r\n    for _ in range(3):\r\n    \tenemy = enemy_prototype.clone()\r\n    \tenemy.goto(randint(-400, 400), 300)\r\n    \tenemy.velocity = randint(4, 8)\r\n    \tenemy.showturtle()\r\n    \tenemies.append(enemy)\r\n    \r\n    # pen\r\n    pen = Turtle()\r\n    pen.hideturtle()\r\n    pen.penup()\r\n    pen.sety(260)\r\n    \r\n    # keyboard bindind\r\n    screen.onkeypress(p_up, &#39;Up&#39;)\r\n    screen.onkeypress(p_down, &#39;Down&#39;)\r\n    screen.onkeypress(p_right, &#39;Right&#39;)\r\n    screen.onkeypress(p_left, &#39;Left&#39;)\r\n    screen.listen()\r\n    \r\n    move()\r\n    \r\n    screen.mainloop()\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044116/box-clones-dont-move-down-like-originals/58046328#58046328","title":"Box clones don&#39;t move down like originals"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11976617,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b211e918ce084dc6afba7291a9c4442?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11976617/jeff"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77063,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569130401,"creation_date":1569100098,"last_edit_date":1569105676,"question_id":58044116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58044116","body_markdown":"I made a code that generates a couple random red boxes and they&#39;re supposed to move down, and then the blue box (the player) needs to dodge them using the arrow keys.

Usually, when you&#39;re writing a try/except, you&#39;d catch the exception type that would be thrown if the error that you&#39;re anticipating occurs (as I think you already know). \r\n\r\nFor example: let&#39;s say we have variable ```var1```, and it happens to be equal to string value of ```&quot;hello&quot;```. If you ran ```var2 = int(var1))```, Python would throw a ```ValueError``` exception. Because you may expect that, you could write something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar1 = &quot;hello&quot;\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    int(var1)\r\nexcept ValueError:\r\n    print(&quot;Invalid casting attempt on non-numeric value.&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your case, you are dealing something that is very unlikely (if ever) to happen. To handle cases like this, you can write generic `except` handling. This way, you are not catching a particular type of exception. You are catching *any* exception that may be thrown as a result of the attempted logic. \r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar1 = &quot;hello&quot;\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    time = time.time()\r\nexcept:\r\n    print(&quot;Error occurred during try statement.&quot;)\r\n    # return value if this is part of a function/handling of your choice\r\n```\r\n\r\nPerhaps others will have a better example, but this is how I would handle an exception if I am unsure of what particular type may be thrown.

I tried chaining the command with a `.setDuration(&#39;1234&#39;)` but it was not working neither.\r\n\r\nIs this a restriction to the fact I am streaming the file (and therefore ffmpeg sends an unknown duration of 0) or I am doing something wrong ?\r\n\r\n[Edit] a similar question has been answered [here](https://superuser.com/a/1436849) \r\n\r\n&gt; &quot;FFmpeg can&#39;t update metadata in WAVE files when output is written\r\n&gt; over a non-seekable protocol like a pipe.&quot; it is however possible to manually set the duration ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58044073/fluent-ffmpeg-how-to-set-a-duration-to-a-stream","title":"fluent ffmpeg how to set a duration to a stream?"},{"tags":["visual-studio-code","vscode-settings"],"owner":{"reputation":890,"user_id":971583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19074c3be125ac36f7a55a71798c65d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alan Baljeu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/971583/alan-baljeu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":890,"user_id":971583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19074c3be125ac36f7a55a71798c65d3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alan Baljeu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/971583/alan-baljeu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569101999,"creation_date":1569099781,"last_edit_date":1569101999,"question_id":58044071,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58044071","body_markdown":"The vscode IDE was working great with Perforce but now although the SCM tab shows Perforce info (like checked out files), it never responds to me attempting to edit/save a file with the expected call to perforce to check out that file.\r\n\r\nLooking at the OUTPUT view, we see for example:\r\n\r\n    p4.exe -u alan -c acer_vmm -p aught:2666 opened &quot;c:\\vmm\\2018\\branches\\gen3\\bd.pl&quot;\r\n    p4.exe -u alan -c acer_vmm -p aught:2666 print -q &quot;c:\\vmm\\2018\\branches\\gen3\\bd.pl&quot;\r\n\r\nAll that needs to happen is to spit out a line replacing &#39;opened&#39; with &#39;edit&#39; and all will be well.

I am a complete noob at Python so I am trying to learn the basics for my class (and our teacher doesn&#39;t teach well at all). We are currently working on a `tkinter` GUI.\r\n\r\nI am currently tasked with coding a pretty simple calculator for my class that involves with all numbers 0 - 9, square root, square root of addition of squares of two given values (`sqrt(A2 + B2))`, `sin`, `cos`, and `tan`) function as well as lastly `sin-1`, `cos-1`, and `tan-1`.\r\n\r\nNow, I have completed the majority of this task as it can be seen here in the pastebin link below:\r\n\r\n_However_, the only thing I can&#39;t figure out for the life of me is being able to have my &quot;INV&quot; button working in the sense so that when I would click the button &lt;kbd&gt;INV&lt;/kbd&gt;, it would replace the three trig functions buttons on the calculator (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`) and replace it with inverse buttons(`sin-1`, `cos-1`, `tan-1`). Then, once I completed calculating said inverse trig function, the inverse buttons(`sin-1`, `cos-1`, `tan-1`) would then be replaced back again to normal trig (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`).\r\n\r\nI am able to toggle between the trig and inverse trigs. However, after toggling the INV button twice, it stops calculating trig and inverse trig numbers after that (though continues to toggle just fine).\r\n\r\nIs there any way I could make that function loop infinitely, so it calculated every time I toggle or something along the lines of that?
