a couple of ways to do this.\r\n\r\nSee below for some code:\r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import datetime\r\n    \r\n    import click\r\n    \r\n    def make_data():\r\n        Nrain       = 20\r\n        start       = datetime.date(2017,12,1)\r\n        end         = datetime.date(2019,1,1)\r\n        \r\n        period      = (end-start).days/365\r\n        rainfall    = 30*np.random.rand(Nrain) + 120*(1+np.cos(Nrain/period))\r\n        \r\n        delta       = (end-start)/Nrain\r\n        dates       = [start + i*delta for i in range(Nrain)]\r\n        return rainfall, dates\r\n    \r\n    def plot_rain(rainfall):\r\n        fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))\r\n        \r\n        ax = fig.subplots()\r\n        ax.plot(rainfall)\r\n        return fig\r\n    \r\n    def xticks_auto(ax,dates,Nticks=10):\r\n        delta       = (dates[-1]-dates[0])/Nticks\r\n        tick_dates  = [dates[0] + i*delta for i in range(Nticks)]\r\n        x_ticks     = [&#39;{}/{}&#39;.format(d.month,d.year) for d in tick_dates]\r\n        \r\n        ax.set_xticks([i*len(dates)/Nticks for i in range(Nticks)])\r\n        ax.set_xticklabels(x_ticks)\r\n    \r\n    def xticks_pres(ax,dates,Nticks=10):\r\n        start_m     = click.prompt(&#39;Start month&#39;, type=int)\r\n        start_y     = click.prompt(&#39;Start year&#39;, type=int)\r\n        end_m       = click.prompt(&#39;End month&#39;, type=int)\r\n        end_y       = click.prompt(&#39;End year&#39;, type=int)\r\n        \r\n        start       = datetime.date(start_y,start_m,1)\r\n        end         = datetime.date(end_y,end_m,1)\r\n        Nticks      = 10\r\n        delta       = (end-start)/Nticks\r\n        tick_dates  = [start + i*delta for i in range(Nticks)]\r\n        x_ticks     = [&#39;{}/{}&#39;.format(d.month,d.year) for d in tick_dates]\r\n        \r\n        ax.set_xticks([i*len(dates)/Nticks for i in range(Nticks)])\r\n        ax.set_xticklabels(x_ticks)\r\n\r\n`make_data()` makes some pseudo-rainfall data. If we run some simple code to begin with:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; rainfall, dates = make_data()\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = plot_rain(rainfall)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; ax = fig.axes[0]\r\n\r\nThis generates some data and plots it to a figure:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNote that the x-values are simply the indices of the datapoints. If we run `xticks_pres`, one can prescribe a start date and end date, and the xticks will be updated:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = plot_rain(rainfall)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; ax = fig.axes[0]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; xticks_pres(ax,dates)\r\n    Start month: \r\n    5\r\n    Start year: \r\n    2011\r\n    End month: \r\n    6\r\n    End year: \r\n    2015\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nTo be able to add the date points you need either the length of the dates set, or the length of the rainfall set. If you have the dates set, you might as well use an automatic fill:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = plot_rain(rainfall)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; ax = fig.axes[0]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; xticks_auto(ax,dates,5)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nOn this last code executution, I overrode the defaults value of 10 for Nticks, specifying that I only want 5 ticks.\r\n\r\nI think with these snippets you should be able to do what you want to achieve. If you really want to use user input you can, but for most cases it&#39;s easier to simply jiggle the xticks automatically.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OIROv.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8RBUo.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/W495g.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387731/plotting-month-year-as-x-ticks-in-matplotlib/58394968#58394968","title":"Plotting month year as x ticks in matplotlib"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":11661097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57bcf8f8cf0f976d3d849695cc57e26f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"drewster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11661097/drewster"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3551,"user_id":3381305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e9bb4c57a03583c724f0fe037344a2cd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kwinkunks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3381305/kwinkunks"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571143233,"creation_date":1571117081,"last_edit_date":1571137515,"question_id":58387731,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387731","body_markdown":"I have a function that takes a month and year and I want to set the xticks of a plot to the month and year that is inputted.\r\n\r\nFor example if user enters 5 as the month and 2019 as the year I want to make the first xtick 5/2018, the second one 6/2018, and so on.

The encoder portion will live on the transmitter side of the transceiver and the decoder will live on the receiver side. In general, the transmitter and receiver could be separated by miles and will exist on different computers.\r\n\r\nThe autoencoder must be trained using the real physical channel, therefore it will be necessary to perform backpropagation across two different computers (the transmitter and receiver computers). My question is, how can I start the process of back propagation on the receiver side, and finish it on the transmitter side?\r\n\r\nTo make this problem a little simpler, if you can help me perform backprop across two different files, that might be enough for me to extend it as needed. Imagine the encoder is defined by one file and the decoder is defined by another. How would I perform backprop across these two separate files?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m willing to use either pytorch or tensorflow, whichever is better suited to solve the problem. Pytorch would be my first choice if possible.\r\n\r\nHere is pytorch code for a standard autoencoder that lives in one file and acts on CIFAR data. You can see how backpropagation is performed in one line loss.backward().

it happens because the `SigninManger::SignInAsync()` will actually try to **send a cookie** over `HTTP` to indicate this user has already signed in. But when dealing with Blazor Server Side at this moment, there&#39;s **no available `HTTP` Response** at all , there&#39;s only a **WebSocket connection** (SignalR).\r\n\r\n### How to Fix\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell,  Signin is to persist user credentials/cookies/... so that the WebApp knows who the client is. Since you&#39;re using a Blazor Server Side, your client is talking to the server within a **WebSocket connection**. There&#39;s no need to send cookies over `HTTP`. Because your WebApp has already knows who the current user is. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue,  register an `IHostEnvironmentAuthenticationStateProvider` service firstly:\r\n```csharp\r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;AuthenticationStateProvider, RevalidatingIdentityAuthenticationStateProvider&lt;IdentityUser&gt;&gt;();\r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;IHostEnvironmentAuthenticationStateProvider&gt;(sp =&gt; {\r\n    // this is safe because \r\n    //     the `RevalidatingIdentityAuthenticationStateProvider` extends the `ServerAuthenticationStateProvider`\r\n    var provider = (ServerAuthenticationStateProvider) sp.GetRequiredService&lt;AuthenticationStateProvider&gt;();\r\n    return provider;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then create a principal and replace the old one .\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&lt;b&gt;@inject AuthenticationStateProvider AuthenticationStateProvider\r\n@inject IHostEnvironmentAuthenticationStateProvider HostAuthentication&lt;/b&gt;\r\n...\r\n\r\nvar user = await userManager.FindByNameAsync(UserName);\r\n&lt;b&gt;var valid= await signInManager.UserManager.CheckPasswordAsync(user, Password);&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\nif (valid)\r\n{\r\n    &lt;b&gt;var principal = await signInManager.CreateUserPrincipalAsync(user);\r\n\r\n    var identity = new ClaimsIdentity(\r\n        principal.Claims,\r\n        Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies.CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme\r\n    );\r\n    principal = new System.Security.Claims.ClaimsPrincipal(identity);\r\n    signInManager.Context.User = principal;\r\n    HostAuthentication.SetAuthenticationState(Task.FromResult(new AuthenticationState(principal)));&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n    // now the authState is updated\r\n    var authState = await AuthenticationStateProvider.GetAuthenticationStateAsync();\r\n\r\n    successMessage = $&quot;{UserName}, signed in.&quot;;\r\n    errorMessage = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    successMessage = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    errorMessage = &quot;Username or password is incorrect.&quot;;\r\n}\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd check the `authState`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5fsK.gif\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLoTX.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387683/signin-for-blazor-server-side-app-not-working/58390813#58390813","title":"SignIn for Blazor Server-Side app not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":727,"user_id":1206480,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/369c998e75bc392472c387df640dd97a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1206480","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1206480/user1206480"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2476,"user_id":703163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LP2dV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JohnB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/703163/johnb"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58390813,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571215916,"creation_date":1571116760,"last_edit_date":1571119803,"question_id":58387683,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387683","body_markdown":"I am building a sample login razor component for an Asp.net core 3.0 Blazor Server-Side app. Whenever the code reaches the SignInAsyc method it just appears to hang or lock-up, as the code ceases further execution.

But in Indy 10, that overload was removed, and the timeout parameter was reimplemented as a `ConnectTimeout` property.\n\nYour original code compiles because `Connect()` in Indy 10 has an overload that takes a hostname `String` as input, overwriting the `Host` property, and `(Ansi|Unicode)String` has a constructor that accepts an `int` as input. Thus, your code is effectively doing this\n\n```c++\nIdSMTP1-&gt;Connect(String(1000));\n```\n\nWhich tries to connect to a hostname named `&quot;1000&quot;`, ignoring the `&quot;smtp.office365.com&quot;` hostname you assigned to the `Host` property. That is why you are getting socket error 11001.\n\nYou need to replace the offending line with this code instead:\n\n```c++\n//IdSMTP1-&gt;Connect(1000);\nIdSMTP1-&gt;ConnectTimeout = 1000;\nIdSMTP1-&gt;Connect();\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387652/indy-10-socket-error-11001-host-not-found/58460349#58460349","title":"Indy 10 socket error 11001 Host not found"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":6604390,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a5166a6a6245760f1a4d5c9caef3b31?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user6604390","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6604390/user6604390"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571457269,"creation_date":1571116509,"question_id":58387652,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387652","body_markdown":"I am trying to send email using Indy 10.5.7 on C++ Builder XE but I get Host not found error.

However, I am having issues with it looking clean and not interfering with content on the page. Ideally, I would like the bar to render in fixed or sticky position and push the page content down by 50px, and then if closed the page content will go up again by 50px. (See https://www.standardcameras.com home page for example).\r\n\r\nThe issue I&#39;m having is that I can&#39;t predictably push everything down by 50px. This seems to vary per web page (I imagine it depends on what the topmost element is, its positioning, and what padding/margins, etc are set for the rest of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried setting the top margin of the body to 50px, tried the same with padding.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve similarly tried to do so with Javascript using\r\n\r\ndocument.body.style.marginTop = &#39;50px&#39;;\r\n\r\nCurrently the code that renders the navbar is as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    let x = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;BODY&quot;)[0];\r\n\r\n    navBar =  document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n\r\n    navBar.setAttribute(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;navBar&quot;);\r\n\r\n    navBar.innerHTML = &#39;&lt;div id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;pwmd&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;;\r\n\r\n    x.insertBefore(navBar, x.firstChild);\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    #navBar {\r\n    \twidth: 100vw;\r\n    \tbackground-color: grey;\r\n    \theight: 20px;\r\n    \tpadding: 15px 0px;\r\n    \tposition: fixed;\r\n    \ttop: 0px;\r\n    \tz-index: 99999999999999;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    #navBar p, #navBar a, #navBar h1, #navBar h2, #navBar h3, #navBar h4, #navBar h5, #navBar h6, #navBar li {\r\n    \tcolor: white;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #navBAR #title {\r\n    \tmargin-left: 10px;\r\n    \tdisplay: inline-block;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, the javascript is working as expected and rendering a div with those properties at the top of the HTML body. I just can&#39;t get it to position correctly. I expect it to position at the top of the page (I&#39;m not at this point even trying to get it to reposition the rest of the content, thats a long term goal) but sometimes it renders near the end of the page, sometimes it renders after a header, etc. How can I modify either my CSS or my Javascript to fix this?\r\n\r\nI seriously appreciate your input.. thanks in advance!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387642/browser-extension-development-offset-page-by-x-amount-of-pixels-to-show-top-na","title":"Browser Extension Development - offset page by x

Implementors define a single method with no arguments called `call`. \r\n\r\nAPIs that use implementations of `Callable`, such as [`ExecutorService#invokeAny(Collection)`][2], will invoke the `call` method which means the actual work needs to be implemented inside said `call` method. However, your code is the following:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String call() throws Exception {\r\n    throw new UnsupportedOperationException(&quot;Not supported yet.&quot;); //To change body of generated methods, choose Tools | Templates.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is why you&#39;re getting an `UnsupportedOperationException`, because that&#39;s exactly what the method is programed to do. To fix this you need to simply implement the method properly. You also have:\r\n\r\n    public void run() {\r\n        processCommand(start, end);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhich makes me think you either got confused between the `Runnable` and `Callable` interfaces or the `WorkerThread` class used to implement `Runnable` and you forgot to update the code completely when switching to `Callable`. Assuming `processCommand` is the actual work of the task, your `call` method should look something like:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String call() throws Exception {\r\n        processCommand(start, end);\r\n        return &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s supposed to be returned&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd you can remove the `run` method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Awaiting Termination\r\n\r\nYou shouldn&#39;t spin waiting for the `ExecutorService` to terminate:\r\n\r\n    while (!executor.isTerminated()) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe interface provides a method which blocks until the `ExecutorService` has terminated, which is typically much more CPU friendly: [`ExecutorService#awaitTermination(long,TimeUnit)`][4]. The method accepts a timeout value to specify the maximum amount of time the thread should block awaiting termination. If you want to wait &quot;forever&quot; use a really large value, such as:\r\n\r\n    executor.awaitTermination(Long.MAX_VALUE, TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Avoid Raw Types\r\n\r\nI recommend reading [What is a raw type and why shouldn&#39;t we use it?][3]. The `Callable` interface is generic yet in some places you are using the raw type. Instead of having:\r\n\r\n    public class WorkerThread implements Callable {...}\r\n    // and\r\n    Callable worker = new WorkerThread(...);\r\n\r\nYou should have:\r\n\r\n    public class WorkerThread implements Callable&lt;String&gt; {...}\r\n    // and\r\n    Callable&lt;String&gt; worker = new WorkerThread&lt;&gt;(...);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# UI Threading\r\n\r\nNote you have a `java.awt.Label` which is being updated inside the `processCommand` method. Keep in mind that UI objects typically **must** only be accessed on the UI thread (e.g. the _Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)_ in Swing). At least, that&#39;s the case with Swing—I&#39;m not sure if AWT is thread-safe or not. That said, I&#39;m not actually sure why you&#39;re using a `Label` since none of your code appears to be related to a GUI.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/Callable.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#invokeAny(java.util.Collection)\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2770321\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#awaitTermination(long,java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387614/how-to-fix-concurrent-executionexception-caused-by-java-lang-unsupportedoperati/58390157#58390157","title":"How to fix concurrent.ExecutionException Caused by: java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11080154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f95508b9a1ccbf7f151fca7715b0fdba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hither Joe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11080154/hither-joe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15457,"user_id":6395627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dac5493d339ba8cb379f4efb2485d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Slaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6395627/slaw"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58390157,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571127992,"creation_date":1571116298,"last_edit_date":1571116886,"question_id":58387614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387614","body_markdown":"I posted a question on about brute forcing[CodeReview](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/230610/brute-force-id-reversal-search/230622?noredirect=1#comment449625_230622), and a good [expert](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/users/25834/reinderien) helped me out by suggesting I should use multithreading to improve the speed of my program.

I have the following pieces of code that are somewhat similar to the example found on https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/idl/jidlExample3.html\r\n\r\nI have the following IDL file:\r\n\r\n     module CallBack\r\n     {\r\n\t     interface CallBackInterface\r\n\t     {\r\n\t\t void notifyMe(in string message);\r\n\t     };\r\n\t     interface CallBackServerInterface\r\n\t     {\r\n\t     void register(in CallBackInterface callback);\r\n\t     };\r\n      };\r\nI then created the server servant CallBackServer which all it does is send a message to the method notifyMe(labeled above):\r\n\r\n              public class CallBackServer extends CallBackServerInterfacePOA\r\n              {\r\n\t             public void register(CallBackInterface callback)\r\n\t             {\r\n\t\t           callback.notifyMe(&quot;Hello World&quot;);\r\n\t             }\r\n               }\r\nI then created a client object that a client will pass to the corba object: \r\n\r\n              public class CallBackClient extends CallBackInterfacePOA\r\n              {\r\n\t           public void notifyMe(String message){\r\n                  \r\n\t\t           System.out.println(message);\r\n\t           }\r\n               }\r\nI then created the Server:\r\n\r\n              public class CBServer \r\n              {\r\n\t             public static void main(String[]args)\r\n\t             {\r\n\t\t            try\r\n\t\t            {\r\n\t\t              ORB orb = ORB.init(args,null);\r\n\t\t              POA rootPOA =POAHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;));//step to activate and name root POA\r\n\t\t              rootPOA.the_POAManager().activate();\r\n\t\t              CallBackServer s = new CallBackServer();\r\n\t\t              org.omg.CORBA.Object ref = rootPOA.servant_to_reference(s);\r\n\t\t              CallBackServerInterface cb = CallBackServerInterfaceHelper.narrow(ref);\r\n\t\t              org.omg.CORBA.Object objref = orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;);\r\n\t\t              NamingContextExt ncRef = NamingContextExtHelper.narrow(objref);\r\n\t\t              NameComponent path[] = ncRef.to_name(&quot;CallBack&quot;);\r\n\t\t              ncRef.rebind(path,cb);\r\n\t\t              System.out.println(&quot;Server is running&quot;);\r\n\t\t              orb.run();\r\n\t\t             }\r\n\t\t             catch(Exception e)\r\n\t\t             {\r\n\t\t\t         System.out.println(&quot;Error in server: &quot; + e);\r\n\t\t             }\r\n\t\t\r\n\t                }\r\n                }\r\n\r\nFinally I created the Client(this is where my problems come up):\r\n\r\n            public class CBClient \r\n            {\r\n\t             static CallBackServerInterface cb;\r\n\t             public static void main(String[]args)\r\n\t             {\r\n\t\t            ORB orb = ORB.init(args,null);\r\n\t\t            try\r\n\t\t            {\r\n\t\t\t          org.omg.CORBA.Object objRef = \r\n                      orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;NameService&quot;);\r\n\t\t              NamingContextExt ncRef = NamingContextExtHelper.narrow(objRef);\r\n                      cb= CallBackServerInterfaceHelper.narrow(ncRef.resolve_str(&quot;CallBack&quot;)); \r\n\t                  POA rootPOA = POAHelper.narrow(orb.resolve_initial_references(&quot;RootPOA&quot;));\r\n\t                  CallBackClient c =   new CallBackClient();\r\n\t                  rootPOA.activate_object(c);\r\n\t                  CallBackInterface i = \r\n              CallBackInterfaceHelper.narrow(rootPOA.servant_to_reference(c));\r\n\t\t             cb.register(i);//will print on server\r\n\r\n\t\t           }\r\n\t               catch(Exception e)\r\n\t                {\r\n\t\t\t        System.out.println(&quot;Error in Client&quot; + e);\r\n\t                }\r\n\t              }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry about the format of the client,I tried to format the text and this what the best I could get.\r\n\r\nThe issue with the client is that when cb.register(i); is called it does call the register() method on the server but on the line &quot;callback.notifyMe(&quot;Hello World&quot;);&quot;, the program never seems to call this method and for some reason the system seems to be going in an infinite loop as the client does not stop running.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated to better understand how Corba works.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387602/corba-call-back-message-not-outputting","title":"Corba call back message not outputting"},{"tags":["html","css","jupyter-notebook"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1120,"user_id":3783002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/06d56953a61cb745cc8c7755fe0a0b37?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user32882","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3783002/user32882"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571118871,"post_id":58387869,"comment_id":103122972,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387601/cannot-add-table-borders-in-jupyter-notebook-markdown-cell/58387869#comment103122972_58387869"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11562809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UgrCB.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"neoney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11562809/neoney"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571117937,"creation_date":1571117937,"answer_id":58387869,"question_id":58387601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58387869","body_markdown":"You can do it this way (in a CSS file or &lt;style&gt;

updates the record\r\n - User 2 trys to update the record , but because the data has changed , it should fail.\r\n\r\nWhen I was programming with C# and SQL server , If a table had a timestamp in it

To overcome this, I changed the type to `dynamic` and check if there were `int`s really.\r\n\r\n    [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]\r\n    public class TomatoViewer\r\n    {\r\n        public float rating;\r\n        public int numReviews;\r\n        public int meter;\r\n    }\r\n    [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]\r\n    public class Tomato\r\n    {\r\n        public TomatoViewer viewer;\r\n        public string production;\r\n        public DateTime lastUpdated;\r\n    }\r\n    [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]\r\n    public class Award\r\n    {\r\n        public int wins;\r\n        public int nominations;\r\n        public string text;\r\n    }\r\n    [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]\r\n    public class Imdb\r\n    {\r\n        public decimal rating;\r\n        public int votes;\r\n        public int id;\r\n    }\r\n    [BsonIgnoreExtraElements]\r\n    public class Movie\r\n    {\r\n        public string plot;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; genres;\r\n        public int runtime;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; cast;\r\n        public dynamic title;\r\n        public string fullplot;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; languages;\r\n        public DateTime released;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; directors;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; writers;\r\n        public Award awards;\r\n        public string lastupdated;\r\n        public int year;\r\n        public Imdb imdb;\r\n        public IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; countries;\r\n        public string type;\r\n        public Tomato tomatoes;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        var client =\r\n            new MongoClient(\r\n                &quot;mongodb+srv://...&quot;);\r\n        var database = client.GetDatabase(&quot;sample_mflix&quot;);\r\n        var movies = database.GetCollection&lt;Movie&gt;(&quot;movies&quot;);\r\n        var titles = movies.AsQueryable().Select(x =&gt; x.title).ToList();\r\n        foreach (var numTitle in titles.OfType&lt;int&gt;())\r\n        {\r\n            Console.Write(numTitle);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387566/c-poco-class-for-mongo-sample-database/58445852#58445852","title":"C# POCO class for Mongo sample database"}],"owner":{"reputation":311,"user_id":1491433,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fefea25b93cfc765357ca09a8d34428?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kevin Burton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491433/kevin-burton"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571383422,"creation_date":1571116004,"question_id":58387566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387566","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a Model for the &#39;movie&#39; collection in the &#39;sample_mflix&#39; database that is part of the &quot;sample&quot; databases available for MongoDB (https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/sample-data/available-sample-datasets/).

Namely, I only care about components that overlap with a &quot;reference&quot; array. For example, if we were to compute the cosine similarity between the following two arrays:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA = [1 0 1]     B = [1 1 0]\r\n    [0 1 1]         [0 1 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say `B` is the reference array. Then `A` changes with respect to each row in B, to only include components that overlap with that row. E.g., the first row in `B` is `[1 1 0]`, so the similarity computation is with the modified A matrix:\r\n```\r\n[1 0 0]\r\n[0 1 0]\r\n```\r\nTo compute the next similarities with `[0 1 1]`, the modified `A` becomes:\r\n```\r\n[0 0 1]\r\n[0 1 1]\r\n```\r\nMy question is: is there a way to introduce this modification without drastically slowing down performance (when compared to built-in cosine similarity options like `sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity`)? I understand nothing will be as fast as a standard cosine similarity computation, but right now my attempts to introduce this change have resulted in a slowdown of nearly 100x, so any improvement on that would be great.\r\n\r\n## Attempts\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t really know of any way to do this outside of going row-by-row through the reference array, masking the other array according to the current row, and then doing matrix-vector cosine similarity. Something like this:\r\n```\r\ndef modified_cosine_sim(arr1, arr2):\r\n    # arr2 is reference array\r\n    final_arr = []\r\n    for row in arr2:\r\n        masked_arr1 = arr1 * np.where(row &gt; 0, 1, 0)\r\n        final_arr.append(cosine_similarity(masked_arr1, row))\r\n    \r\n    return final_arr \r\n```\r\nThis is pretty inefficient, though. I checked to see if there was some clever way to modify the sklearn `cosine_similarity` code to accomplish the goal here, but that code relies on normalizing both arrays before the computation proceeds, and I can&#39;t really do that -- `arr1` effectively changes throughout the computation, depending on the row in `arr2` that&#39;s currently being used to compute similarities. \r\n\r\nI have to run this computation repeatedly on somewhat large arrays, so any optimization tips would be greatly appreciated. Or if this computation corresponds to some already optimized built-in function I&#39;m unfamiliar with, that would be even better.

I have removed some values, so this is a partial of the JSON structure &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n        @result = {\r\n          &quot;geoScope&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;GeoScope&quot;: &quot;Virtual&quot;,\r\n          &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;: &quot;Geo Neig&quot;,\r\n          &quot;ServiceAreaName&quot;: &quot;Geo Location&quot;,\r\n          &quot;State&quot;: &quot;Geo STate&quot;,\r\n          &quot;Country&quot;: &quot;Geo Country&quot;,\r\n          &quot;Region&quot;: &quot;Geo Region&quot;,\r\n          &quot;City&quot;: &quot;Geo City&quot;,\r\n          &quot;County&quot;: &quot;Geo County&quot;\r\n         },\r\n         &quot;programs&quot;: [\r\n                     {\r\n                     &quot;S_Addiction&quot;: false,\r\n                     &quot;S_Identification&quot;: true,\r\n                     &quot;PopulationDescription&quot;: [\r\n                                              {\r\n                                              &quot;xpath&quot;: &quot;n/a&quot;,\r\n                                              &quot;text&quot;: &quot;Program One&quot;,\r\n                                              &quot;domain&quot;: &quot;n/a&quot;\r\n                                              }\r\n           ], ... and it continues with more arrays of hashes...\r\n\r\n&lt;b&gt;My Attempt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nI have no problem simply displaying this data, but creating forms is the pain. What I am doing is breaking the Hash down into its parts, (it is consists of 4 forms) and trying to create an input from the key/value, and depending on the type of value (string, array or object) populate the input value. (label = Key, Input.value = Value)\r\n\r\n\r\n       #controller\r\n       @result.each do |k,v|\r\n        case k.to_s\r\n             when &#39;geoScope&#39;\r\n                   @geoValue = v\r\n                   # =&gt; { &quot;GeoScope&quot;: &quot;Virtual&quot;, &quot;Neighborhoods&quot;: &quot;Geo Neig&quot; ...}\r\n        end\r\n       end \r\n\r\n      #view\r\n         &lt;%= @geoValue.each do |k,v| %&gt;\r\n\r\n             &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\r\n               newInput = document.createElement(&quot;input&quot;);\r\n               newInput.value = &lt;% k %&gt; #=&gt; undefined.value = [object HTMLInputElement]\r\n               document.body.appendChild(newInput) \r\n             &lt;/script&gt;\r\n          &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&quot;&lt;%=/&lt;% k %&gt;&quot; will not work inside the script. If I can make that happen, I can solve this. I would prefer to develop a solution myself because some of the values are a hash that contain 3 values and sometimes that value is just a string.\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nAs always, thank you StackOverflow community.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387543/json-to-html-form-ruby-on-rails","title":"JSON to HTML Form.

In order to access this stored content later you have to pass the identifier as an argument to `content_for`.\r\nNote: yield can still be used to retrieve the stored content.\r\n\r\nOr in other words, the `content_for` method allows you to insert content into a named yield block in your layout.\r\n\r\n### for example\r\nIf your current layout contains a `yield(:title)` ...\r\n```\r\n&lt;!-- app/views/layouts/application.html.erb --&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;div id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;%= content_for?(:title) ? yield(:title) : &quot;No title block!&quot; %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&gt;&lt;%= yield %&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can insert a title from a view like this\r\n```\r\n&lt;!-- app/views/projects/index.html.erb --&gt;\r\n&lt;% content_for :head do %&gt;\r\n &quot;#{@project.name} #{@project.category} #{@project.city}&quot;\r\n&lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/CaptureHelper.html#method-i-content_for\r\nand https://rubyplus.com/articles/3081-Layouts-and-Content-For-Tag-in-Rails-5\r\n\r\nTo answer your question. The error messages you receive tell you that your Ruby code is syntactically incorrect. In idiomatic ruby, it&#39;s always wrong to call functions the way you&#39;ve shown us. Parameters must always be called individually, separated by a comma:\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-none --&gt;\r\n```lang-none\r\n# wrong code, wrong syntax\r\n&lt;%= content_for :page_title @project.name, @project.category, @project.city %&gt;\r\n```\r\n```\r\n# wrong code, right *right syntax*\r\n&lt;%= content_for :page_title, @project.name, @project.category, @project.city %&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso as pointed out in Robin&#39;s answer, the [docs](https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/CaptureHelper.html#method-i-content_for) for `content_for` show that you can only pass one content parameter. So you have to do the concatenation by yourself.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;% content_for :page_title, &quot;#{@project.name} #{@project.category} #{@project.city}&quot; %&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387529/how-do-i-use-content-for/58403181#58403181","title":"How do I use content_for"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":3349825,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/746230036/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3349825","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3349825/user3349825"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4068,"user_id":231441,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a59affa08cf3e8b16c538da0cb2b646?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zzeroo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/231441/zzeroo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58403181,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571384545,"creation_date":1571115738,"last_edit_date":1571177548,"question_id":58387529,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387529","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a dynamic page title.

When the internal `optimized256BinsUseCase` flag is set, it allocates exactly 4096 bytes, omitting that last bit of extra storage. My suspicion is that subsequent operations rely on having more space after the initial data chunk, and inadvertently set the buffer offset past the length of the internal buffer.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to work around this by using a different number of histogram bins, like 512. This wastes a little space and time, but I assume it will produce the same results. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, you might be able to avoid this crash by disabling the Metal validation layer, but I strongly discourage that, since you&#39;ll just be masking the underlying issue till it gets fixed.\r\n\r\n**Note**: I did my reverse-engineering of the MetalPerformanceShaders framework on macOS Catalina.
