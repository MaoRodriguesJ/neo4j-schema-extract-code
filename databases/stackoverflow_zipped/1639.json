Each class must have single superclass (or none, in which case it implicitly inherits from `Object`). Also the variant `declare parents : CSupport extends ASupport;` would not work because it would lead to a circular hierachy, which is of course forbidden because it makes no logical sense.\r\n\r\nYou also seem to misunderstand how a delegator pattern works:\r\n\r\n* It does **not** work via inheritance and `super()` calls but\r\n* by means of an internal member pointing to the delegate (if any, the first member in the chain does not have a delegate, of course).\r\n\r\nLet us just take a look at two of the classes you mentioned in your question, shall we?\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package javax.xml.stream.util;\r\n\r\n    // (...)\r\n\r\n    public class StreamReaderDelegate implements XMLStreamReader {\r\n      private XMLStreamReader reader;\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Construct an empty filter with no parent.\r\n       */\r\n      public StreamReaderDelegate(){}\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Construct an filter with the specified parent.\r\n       * @param reader the parent\r\n       */\r\n      public StreamReaderDelegate(XMLStreamReader reader) {\r\n        this.reader = reader;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      // (...)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    package org.xml.sax.helpers;\r\n\r\n    // (...)\r\n\r\n    public class XMLFilterImpl\r\n      implements XMLFilter, EntityResolver, DTDHandler, ContentHandler, ErrorHandler\r\n    {\r\n      private XMLReader parent = null;\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Construct an empty XML filter, with no parent.\r\n       * (...)\r\n       */\r\n      public XMLFilterImpl() {\r\n        super();\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Construct an XML filter with the specified parent.\r\n       * (...)\r\n       */\r\n      public XMLFilterImpl(XMLReader parent) {\r\n        super();\r\n        setParent(parent);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      /**\r\n       * Set the parent reader.\r\n       * (...)\r\n       */\r\n      public void setParent(XMLReader parent) {\r\n        this.parent = parent;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n       // (...)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSee? In both cases there is no inheritance but delegation. The `super()` calls are unrelated to the delegation pattern, they just make sure that the super class constructor is called as it should be. What we have here is just a flexible list of objects, each one pointing to its delegate, similar to a linked list. This is a much more flexible approach than your idea to cast everything into a fixed set of classes.\r\n\r\nIMO your approach is trying to solve a problem which does not really exist. It is an example of the [XY problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/66378/309898). Feel free ask follow-up questions if I can help you any further with this.

One example is `org.xml.sax.ContentHandler` which has `startElement()`, `characters()`, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to have a set of reusable handlers and chain them in arbitrary order. In Java it&#39;s solved by the delegate design pattern: you create an abstract class that implements each method of the interface, see:\r\n\r\n    javax.xml.stream.util.StreamReaderDelegate\r\n    org.xml.sax.helpers.XMLFilterImpl\r\n    com.common.util.xml.DelegatingContentHandler\r\n\r\nThen you extend this abstract class overriding only the needed methods, then in runtime you create the chain of handlers passing the next delegate to the constructor of the previous delegate.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if `declare parents` of AspectJ would allow to create such chains statically. I don&#39;t want to manually create a delegator class for an interface and I don&#39;t want to create the chains in runtime.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I&#39;ve done so far: there are 3 classes: A,B,C that print their name and then call `super`.

Since we are using conceal, you&#39;ll want to remove `space` from `&#39;listchars&#39;`.\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;ll be using `matchadd()` below, but you can theoretically do something similar with `syn-conceal`. The difference is that a match is local to a window. Syntax is available where defined—you could use any filetype or other mechanism to set this via syntax.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I assume that the regex `\\s` (match whitespace) matches what you need. If you need only spaces, change `\\s` to ` ` (a single space character) in the regexp.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I assume you can read vim regexp. The help pages are extensive, but do note below that I use `\\v` to explicitly set the magic type (`matchadd` is sensitive to regex-influencing options like `&#39;magic&#39;`) and I use `\\zs` where appropriate to start the match.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; I&#39;ll be using the test text below.\r\n\r\n### Test file\r\n\r\n```\r\nword word  word   word\r\nword word  word   word\r\n```\r\n\r\n## `set conceallevel=1`\r\n\r\nAt level 1, we&#39;re allowed to use replacement characters in our matches.\r\n\r\nSo, we could replace all the extra spaces with, e.g., a `.` to make them standout:\r\n\r\n    let space_match = matchadd(&#39;Conceal&#39;, &#39;\\s\\@&lt;=\\s+&#39;, 10, -1, {&#39;conceal&#39;: &#39;.&#39;})\r\n\r\n(10 is the default priority, and -1 requests a new ID for the match.)\r\n\r\n## Cleaning up\r\n\r\nTo get rid of the match/conceal, you can simply\r\n\r\n    call matchdelete(space_match)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe OP has stated that the following worked best for the question:\r\n\r\n    let space_match = matchadd(&#39;Conceal&#39;, &#39;\\v( @&lt;= )|(  @=)&#39;, -1, -1, {&#39;conceal&#39;: &#39;&#183;&#39;})\r\n\r\n- priority `-1` to compatible with `indentLine`\r\n- `( @&lt;= )` to match a space after another space\r\n- `(  @=)` to match a space before another space","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152552/render-space-if-it-have-multi-space-in-vim/58160050#58160050","title":"Render space if it have multi space in Vim"}],"owner":{"reputation":2817,"user_id":6250402,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/204d9039fd69e71bda5b09f12506e12d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hongarc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6250402/hongarc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2817,"user_id":6250402,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/204d9039fd69e71bda5b09f12506e12d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hongarc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6250402/hongarc"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58160050,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570109077,"creation_date":1569735285,"last_edit_date":1570033275,"question_id":58152552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58152552","body_markdown":"I used:\r\n\r\n    set listchars=tab:→\\ ,trail:&#183;,precedes:←,extends:→,nbsp:&#183;,space:&#183;\r\n\r\nto render space and tab character.\r\n\r\nBut I want to show only &gt;=2 space, I don&#39;t want to display if It has one space between other characters.\r\n\r\n(It is the same of `&quot;editor.renderWhitespace&quot;: &quot;boundary&quot;` in vscode)\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nCan I do it in Vim?

the RecyclerView visibility is gone.\r\n\r\nThe `creatorEditorContainer` view has to be positioned just next to  the `closeButton` view, please help me to achieve this.\r\n\r\nI have placed the constraint of `creatorEditorContainer` to the top_to_bottom of `closeButton` and bottom_to_top of RecyclerView\r\n\r\nAnd the `layout_height` property is set to `0dp` so the `creatorEditorContainer` view is positioned to the middle of the `closeButton` view and the `RecyclerView`, help me to move the `creatorEditorContainer` view next to the `closeButton` view without dragging to the center of the screen.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot of Design Editor in Android Studio][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[![Another screenshot of Design Editor in Android Studio][2]][2]\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

question Aquib. Both these things can be done using the DocuSign eSignature REST API. I would recommend you look at some of code examples that show how to do these things here:\r\nhttps://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/code-examples\r\nSpecifically, let me answer your questions:\r\n1. Users can select their signatures the first time they are asked to sign, whether this is done via an integration or via direct send from DocuSign application. The system will remember your selection.

Will the benefits outweigh costs like the extra overdraw? \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uALst.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jy1kp.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/reuMO.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152519/custom-view-with-a-tiled-texture-and-a-mask","title":"Custom view with a tiled texture and a mask"},{"tags":["sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57829,"user_id":9473764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1a6d80ec4ac5549a392ae88fb0ed688?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9473764/nick"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569735261,"post_id":58152512,"comment_id":102688401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152512/how-to-find-the-maximum-across-all-groups-when-there-can-be-multiple-maximum-val#comment102688401_58152512"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26109,"user_id":6914864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc066595e0d6479eecb0d26ec4822ac3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fahmi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6914864/fahmi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569735227,"creation_date":1569735227,"answer_id":58152541,"question_id":58152512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58152541","body_markdown":"You can try below -\r\n\r\n    SELECT race,hero, Power\r\n    FROM heroes_info a\r\n    where power in (select max(pawer) from heroes_info a1 where a.race=a1.race)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152512/how-to-find-the-maximum-across-all-groups-when-there-can-be-multiple-maximum-val/58152541#58152541","title":"How to find the maximum across all groups when there can be multiple maximum values in one group"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":744,"user_id":2474694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3feebe9056b70e07af85fd9398987ad9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"User965207","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2474694/user965207"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569741518,"creation_date":1569741518,"answer_id":58153147,"question_id":58152512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58153147","body_markdown":"we can use the rank function to sort the heroes based on power desc and print the heros with rank 1 as below \r\n\r\n    SELECT race, \r\n           hero \r\n    FROM   (SELECT hero, \r\n                   race, \r\n                   Rank() \r\n                     OVER ( \r\n                       partition BY race \r\n                       ORDER BY power DESC) rank1 \r\n            FROM   heroes_info) AS heroes \r\n    WHERE  heroes.rank1 = 1 ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152512/how-to-find-the-maximum-across-all-groups-when-there-can-be-multiple-maximum-val/58153147#58153147","title":"How to find the maximum across all groups when there can be multiple maximum values in one group"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11907228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-njY3uYpj-RQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAcoQ/g2_UEs_vBsg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sudeshna Sen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11907228/sudeshna-sen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26109,"user_id":6914864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc066595e0d6479eecb0d26ec4822ac3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fahmi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6914864/fahmi"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569741518,"creation_date":1569734920,"last_edit_date":1569735020,"question_id":58152512,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58152512","body_markdown":"Question  : Name the most powerful heroes of each race.\r\n\r\nTable:\r\n\r\n    Hero Race Power\r\n    a-bomb human 7000\r\n    amazo human 7000\r\n    ajax cyborg 5000\r\n    mephis cyborg 5600\r\n    ammo human 1000\r\n    ardina alien 2000\r\n    jagua alien 200\r\n    myntria alien 2300\r\n    hyspace alien 2300\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nand so on. \r\n\r\nNow for this data, for the race &quot;human&quot;, we have a-bomb and amazo both of whom have the highest power.

We use `re.sub` to match on this pattern, and then replace with empty string, to effectively remove all matching keywords.  The `re.IGNORECASE` flag makes this regex replacement regardless of the case of the keywords.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152499/how-do-i-remove-a-list-of-words-from-a-paragraph/58152531#58152531","title":"How do I remove a list of words from a paragraph?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":600,"user_id":2609640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/790a2433ad5c793fe5bcd5b8db79df11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"r4ch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2609640/r4ch"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569735190,"creation_date":1569735190,"answer_id":58152539,"question_id":58152499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58152539","body_markdown":"To fix your approach: \r\n``` python\r\nfilteredHistory = history\r\nfor filterWord in fitlerWords:\r\n    filteredHistory = filteredHistory.replace(filterWord, &quot;&quot;)\r\nprint(filteredHistory)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152499/how-do-i-remove-a-list-of-words-from-a-paragraph/58152539#58152539","title":"How do I remove a list of words from a paragraph?"}],"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":6283073,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7ae026b1a93bc8fadfb78934acdd2b7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"e.iluf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6283073/e-iluf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":620,"user_id":11383441,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6fe326a8e47283a622c4dc9bf700992?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kalana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11383441/kalana"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58152531,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569738430,"creation_date":1569734799,"last_edit_date":1569738430,"question_id":58152499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58152499","body_markdown":"I want to remove a list of words from a paragraph.

built an application that downloads a pdf from a certain URL and emails it to certain people based on a certain schedule. For this, I used the request, nodemailer and node-schedule packages. I created a file called Jobs.js where all jobs are held. Its structure looks like below:\r\n```\r\nmodule.exports = { \r\n    Jobs: [\r\n    {\r\n        URL: http://something.com, \r\n        Schedule: &quot;6 * * * *&quot;,\r\n        Sender: me@something.com, \r\n        Reciever: me2@something.com, \r\n        Subject: &quot;periodic update&quot;, \r\n        SuccessMessage: &quot;Please find attached this pdf&quot;,\r\n        FailedMessage: function(){\r\n            return `Unable to send email but you can download from {this.URL}`\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        URL: http://something.com, \r\n        Schedule: &quot;7 * * * *&quot;,\r\n        Sender: me3@something.com, \r\n        Reciever: me4@something.com, \r\n        Subject: &quot;periodic update&quot;, \r\n        SuccessMessage: &quot;Please find attached this pdf&quot;,\r\n        FailedMessage: function(){\r\n            return `Unable to send email but you can download from {this.URL}`\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRight now, I am running the application through nodemon, so when a new job is added and the file saved, it restarts the whole application automatically. I don&#39;t like this as what if the job is added when the one of them was running ! It would restart the whole app and that job would not complete. I want that when a job is added the application is aware and just adds that job to schedule. The scheduling code with node-schedule is pretty straightforward:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJobs.forEach((job) =&gt; {\r\n    schedule.scheduleJob(job.schedule, function(){\r\n        downloadPDF(job); \r\n        sendEmail(job);                 \r\n}); \r\n```\r\nI am currently studying design patterns and wondering if there could be one that solves this problem. What I think I might have done correctly so far is that I have isolated what varies.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152477/is-there-a-way-to-make-changes-to-a-node-application-without-reloading-the-whole","title":"Is there a way to make changes to a node application without reloading the whole application?"},{"tags":["python","python-3.6","raspberry-pi3","pyserial"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":3141181,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50ae80e2482b66e74034fbcfbcee74c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3141181","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3141181/user3141181"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569754111,"post_id":58152534,"comment_id":102691968,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152475/py-serial-readline-not-working-in-python3/58152534#comment102691968_58152534"},{"owner":{"reputation":3444,"user_id":3344612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e08e105852567b8ec250b5476a3b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"teivaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3344612/teivaz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22,"user_id":3141181,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50ae80e2482b66e74034fbcfbcee74c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3141181","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3141181/user3141181"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570025605,"post_id":58152534,"comment_id":102784736,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152475/py-serial-readline-not-working-in-python3/58152534#comment102784736_58152534"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3444,"user_id":3344612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e08e105852567b8ec250b5476a3b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"teivaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3344612/teivaz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3444,"user_id":3344612,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61e08e105852567b8ec250b5476a3b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"teivaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3344612/teivaz"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569832268,"last_edit_date":1569832268,"creation_date":1569735156,"answer_id":58152534,"question_id":58152475,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58152534","body_markdown":"In python 3 the string type was separated from the byte sequence.

As you say, your two versions are equivalent, because SQL defines them to be equivalent.  Expressing an explicit `NULL` constraint is pretty much the same things as saying `INNER JOIN` rather than `JOIN` or including `ELSE NULL` in a `CASE` expression.\r\n\r\nSQL is not a minimalist language.  There are multiple ways to express exactly the same thing.\r\n\r\nIn this case, I think `NULL` is included for two reasons:\r\n\r\n- To be parallel to the `NOT NULL` constraint.  \r\n- If you can explicitly specify one, you should be able to explicitly specify the other.

The body of a proc is not parsed until it is called for the first time. So you can even put total nonsense in there, which will not hurt if it is never executed.\r\n\r\n    proc documentation {} {\r\n        This proc doesn&#39;t contain valid code, but that\r\n        doesn&#39;t lead to an error if it is never invoked.\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo, if your get_qzParam.tcl file only **defines** procs that use things from material_qz.tcl, but those procs are not invoked until after material_qz.tcl is loaded, then everything will just work.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nCommands can also be redefined at run time and then that new definition will be used the next time the command is called. This is a very nice feature that can be used to interactively fix bugs in a running program.\r\n\r\nAnother use is to set up a command that will do some preparation and then replace itself for future use. For example, this will only open an sqlite database on the first use:\r\n\r\n    proc db {args} {\r\n        package require sqlite3\r\n        sqlite3 db database.db\r\n        tailcall db {*}$args\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere, the sqlite3 command overwrites the db proc. So in future invocations, that new command will be used. But that doesn&#39;t affect the already running db proc, which can finish what it is doing. An additional twist is that the db proc calls the db command at the end. But that is the new db command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152421/does-the-order-of-built-in-commands-of-tcl-scripts-matter/58153846#58153846","title":"Does the order of Built-in commands of tcl scripts matter?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9556031,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0cddc3ef6895b36a623b207cb694716?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mos_bad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9556031/mos-bad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107987,"user_id":301832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/965220a70d38e6a29466f44cdb4f804e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Donal Fellows","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/301832/donal-fellows"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58153846,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569844457,"creation_date":1569733919,"last_edit_date":1569844457,"question_id":58152421,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58152421","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using tcl language and using built-in commands to run scripts inside the main tcl script. there are some defined parameters in `material_qz.tcl` which are needed for the `get_qzParam.tcl`.

When I made a vector class everything compiled without errors other than never being used. the code is as follows.\r\n```\r\ntemplate&lt;typename iterator, typename Object&gt; class Vector\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    iterator insert(iterator pos, const Object&amp; x)\r\n    {\r\n        element[pos] = x;\r\n    }\r\n    iterator erase(iterator pos)\r\n    {\r\n        element[pos] = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n    }\r\nprivate:\r\n    iterator pos;\r\n    Object element;\r\n};\r\n```\r\nThe main function looks like this:\r\n```\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    Vector&lt;int, class Object&gt; myVec;\r\n    int i = 9;\r\n    myVec.insert(0,i);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAfter I finished that the only error occors on the line ```Object element``` line.

To make things more complicated, each visual/chart within the embedded iFrame is in fact another iFrame.\r\n\r\nSo it might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!-- Parent PowerBI report iFrame --&gt;\r\n&lt;iframe src=&quot;app.powerbi.com/reportembed?123&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- A line chart --&gt;\r\n    &lt;iframe src=&quot;app.powerbi.com/visial?123&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- A pie chart --&gt;\r\n    &lt;iframe src=&quot;app.powerbi.com/visial?234&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI need to load test this dashboard to see how long it takes for the iFrame and the nested iFrames to finish loading with concurrent users.\r\n\r\nI have a project with selenium and mocha setup to run through a few steps. I&#39;m learning as I go, but currently I have the following steps completed:\r\n\r\n1. Visit the login page\r\n2. Enter in a user&#39;s credentials and submit the form\r\n3. Navigate to the KPI dashboard URL\r\n4. Detect that the iFrame is present in the DOM\r\n\r\nUnsolved steps:\r\n5. Measure load time for the parent iFrame\r\n6. I&#39;d even consider spot checking a few select nested iFrames to measure their load time\r\n\r\nI thought maybe I could use the Navigation Timing API to get the time till domComplete of the parent iFrame and child iFrames. Turns out, the performance properties are not available due to cross-origin policies. So this didn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Test case\r\nit(&#39;get iFrame load performance&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n    // Locate parent iFrame via xpath\r\n    let parentIframe = By.xpath(&#39;//*[@id=&quot;embedContainer&quot;]/iframe&#39;);\r\n    driver.wait(until.elementLocated(parentIframe, 90000)).then(() =&gt; {\r\n        // Execute JS on the current page\r\n        driver.executeScript(\r\n            &#39;var iframe = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;iframe&quot;)[0].contentWindow; console.log(iframe.contentWindow.performance.timing);&#39;\r\n        )\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n});\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152384/how-do-i-measure-load-time-of-iframe-during-test-using-selenium-and-mocha","title":"How do I measure Load Time of

In binary, how does 10001100 become the two&#39;s complement binary value necessary to output -116?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152358/java-how-does-twos-complement-work-when-casting-an-int-to-a-byte","title":"Java: How does two&#39;s complement work when casting an int to a byte?"},{"tags":["python","django","cart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":12000427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CQH9fnJa-A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reGSsxTv1uEwQO763aWLmNgKI0rfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Muhammed Bilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000427/muhammed-bilal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569737094,"post_id":58152355,"comment_id":102688740,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152355/how-to-add-quantity-of-products-and-update-total-in-cart-using-django#comment102688740_58152355"},{"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10692971,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1232a22b3ae12873f7e4b23a4dbc3de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abdelrahman Mamdouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10692971/abdelrahman-mamdouh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":94,"user_id":12000427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CQH9fnJa-A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reGSsxTv1uEwQO763aWLmNgKI0rfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Muhammed Bilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000427/muhammed-bilal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569772018,"post_id":58152355,"comment_id":102696180,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152355/how-to-add-quantity-of-products-and-update-total-in-cart-using-django#comment102696180_58152355"},{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":12000427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CQH9fnJa-A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reGSsxTv1uEwQO763aWLmNgKI0rfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Muhammed Bilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000427/muhammed-bilal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569774194,"post_id":58152355,"comment_id":102696712,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152355/how-to-add-quantity-of-products-and-update-total-in-cart-using-django#comment102696712_58152355"},{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":12000427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CQH9fnJa-A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reGSsxTv1uEwQO763aWLmNgKI0rfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Muhammed Bilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000427/muhammed-bilal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569774692,"post_id":58152355,"comment_id":102696842,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152355/how-to-add-quantity-of-products-and-update-total-in-cart-using-django#comment102696842_58152355"},{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":12000427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-8CQH9fnJa-A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reGSsxTv1uEwQO763aWLmNgKI0rfQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Muhammed Bilal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12000427/muhammed-bilal"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569775269,"post_id":58152355,"comment_id":102696992,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58152355/how-to-add-quantity-of-products-and-update-total-in-cart-using-django#comment102696992_58152355"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10692971,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1232a22b3ae12873f7e4b23a4dbc3de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abdelrahman Mamdouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10692971/abdelrahman-mamdouh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570198860,"creation_date":1570198860,"answer_id":58238239,"question_id":58152355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58238239","body_markdown":"Ok I figured out a solution for my problem , &lt;br&gt;
