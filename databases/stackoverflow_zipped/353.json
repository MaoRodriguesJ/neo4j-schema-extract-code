your project depends on an artifact like `com.android.support.*`, you have a few choices:\r\n\r\n1. If the dependency is transitive, or comes from another library, you can try to exclude it.\r\n\r\nE.g.: \r\n\r\ncom.some.library:1.0 -&gt; needs com.android.support.*\r\n\r\nIn most cases, whatever is needed from com.android.support, is usually available and backwards compatible in the corresponding androidx artifact. E.g.: a `com.android.support.fragment` should work the same (at the very least) than its androidx counterpart. (Unfortunately, this is not *always* the case).\r\n\r\nThe androidX migration should replace the support artifact with the corresponding androidx for you; see the enable jetifier thing in the [official android migration guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate). \r\n\r\nYou can still use your `com.some.library` but you&#39;re going to have to tell it to `exclude` the support library (so they don&#39;t clash):\r\n\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    implementation (&#39;com.some.library:1.0.0&#39;) {\r\n        exclude group: &#39;com.android.support&#39;, module: &#39;appcompat-v7&#39;\r\n        exclude group: &#39;com.android.support&#39;, module: &#39;support-v4&#39;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way, `some.library` will &quot;find&quot; its dependencies, but taken from your androidx artifacts.\r\n\r\n2. Another thing you can do is let the migration do its thing and hope for the best. In most cases, all the migration does is identify where you have replaceable by androidx dependencies, and modify your XML files, Java/Kotlin imports, etc. to use the new ones. In some cases the migration tool may suggest issues or something, but I&#39;ve only used it a couple of times in small-ish projects so the issues were very minor and in some cases false positives. \r\n\r\nBut in short, anywhere you have, say?\r\n\r\n`&lt;com.android.support.Fragment /&gt;`\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d have to replace with \r\n`&lt;androidx.Fragment /&gt;` (I can&#39;t remember the exact imports now, but you get the idea).\r\n\r\nYou also have to replace your Java or Kotlin imports to reference the new classes:\r\n\r\n`import com.android.support.Fragment` \r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n`import androidx.fragment.app.Fragment` &lt;-- this one is real, I remember it :)\r\n\r\nThe other thing the migration does, is to enable the &quot;jetifier&quot; and androidx project wide. \r\n\r\nThe Jetifier will look at your code and will &quot;replace&quot; the references for you, even after you&#39;ve compiled your code (or maybe it does it during compilation, I don&#39;t remember) but the point is that if a library uses a support reference, it will get androidx-ified for you. The Jetifier was problematic when it first came out, but by now, I&#39;ve had good success with it. So I suggest you try it.\r\n\r\nMy last advice (given that I had to perform this support-&gt;androidx migration in two medium sized projects) is to go slow, one reference at a time, and compiling and testing things as much as you can. And resist the temptation to update all libraries at once. It can lead to unexpected and hard to find problems that generate other problems that may not exist if you had solved the first one... in short: take it slow and analyze each error.\r\n\r\nusing `./gradlew app:dependencies` is also a good way to figure out where some problematic dependency is coming from. \r\n\r\nKeep in mind that some of these issues may arise when you use proguard or minify, and not on &quot;debug&quot; builds (due to clash between the same classes in the classpath). The infamous &quot;duplicate class found...&quot; error, among others.\r\n\r\nSo always try to test, each change. \r\n\r\nAnd last but not least, I suggest you do **not** skip versions in-between:\r\n\r\nE.g.: If your project is targeting api 26 and you use build tools 26.x.x, do not try to jump to androidX (or try, but if you have problems, roll back).\r\n\r\nInstead, migrate to Api 28 (for example) and support tools 28.0.3 (latest support version before androidx). Once you have all working fine up there, only then proceed to try the androidx artifacts. \r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454439/what-is-the-current-way-mid-october-2019-to-include-the-implementation-compat/58458920#58458920","title":"What is the current way (mid October 2019) to include the implementation Compat dependency in an Android app?"}],"owner":{"reputation":655,"user_id":2840370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zqkyg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pixelfairy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2840370/pixelfairy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":655,"user_id":2840370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zqkyg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pixelfairy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2840370/pixelfairy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571438376,"creation_date":1571414440,"last_edit_date":1571414799,"question_id":58454439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454439","body_markdown":"I&#39;m making my first Android app and following along with articles on Developer.Android .\r\n\r\nMy simple app needs to fire some notifications and I wanted to start simply by hard coding one notification in.

design of REST end points depends upon the business domain. There is no hard and fast rule to make one or more end points. It is all about how you design for smooth running of your application. Each REST end point with a controller should be very cohesive. Let us consider an example that organisation, each organization may have many departments, each department may have many employees, each employee will have addresses and so on. Technically you can design only one REST end point to address this, but it will not be a good design. First of all you have address that how many organisations are there and one REST end point should address about organisation details with its ids. The next REST end point should address the departments with org id and so on. If you observe this example, our Organisation object will be more complex as it will have Departments, each department will have Employee as object and so on.\r\n\r\nYou can also think like this, why we do not maintain only one database, why do we maintain multiple database tables with relation. To substantiate, I say that your each REST end point should provide a very specific information rather than all information. There can be a very large complex object for specific information as per the business requirements.\r\n\r\nIn this context, I say, you have to design multiple REST end points for specific information. It should not be based upon the size of the object, it should be specific to business use cases.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454384/do-i-have-to-split-a-controller-with-multiple-endpoints-which-represent-the-crud/58456661#58456661","title":"Do I have to split a controller with multiple endpoints which represent the CRUD operations of components of a more complex object?"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":5497797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fXIBl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dbenor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5497797/dbenor"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571424779,"creation_date":1571414175,"question_id":58454384,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454384","body_markdown":"I have at the moment an object (let&#39;s call it ComplexObj) composed by 10 different objects and I need to create a REST controller or several to handle CRUD operations for ComplexObj and also for its 10 different objects individually.\r\n\r\nI have been researching and what people talk about is to split them if they have a completely different business logic.

you accept the sad truth that you&#39;ll need to maintain some runtime artifact related to `V`, since `V` itself will be [erased](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#what-is-type-erasure), and assuming you can&#39;t actually use the runtime artifact to *define* `V`, the best you can do is have the compiler yell at you if your runtime artifact and `V` are out of sync.  Here&#39;s one way to do it:\r\n\r\n    interface V {\r\n        a: number;\r\n        b: string;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    const keysOfV = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] as const;\r\n    type MutuallyAssignable&lt;T extends U, U extends V, V = T&gt; = void;\r\n    // the following line will give an error if keysOfV is wrong\r\n    type KeysOfVIsGood = MutuallyAssignable&lt;keyof V, typeof keysOfV[number]&gt;; // okay\r\n\r\nNote the `as const` in the definition of `keysOfV`.  That&#39;s a [`const` assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-4.html#const-assertions) and it (or something like it) is needed to have the compiler keep track of the literal string elements of `keysOfV` instead of inferring the correct-but-too-wide type `string[]`.  \r\n\r\nThen, `MutuallyAssignable&lt;T, U&gt;` is a type that evaluates to `void`, but we don&#39;t really care about what it evaluates to.  What we care about is that `T` is [constrained](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html#generic-constraints) to `U`, and `U` is constrained to `T` (via a [default](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-3.html#generic-parameter-defaults) parameter to sidestep a circular constraint violation).  When you use `MutuallyAssignable&lt;X, Y&gt;` on some types `X` and `Y`, you will get a compiler error if the compiler does not recognize that `X` and `Y` are mutually assignable.  \r\n\r\nThen you can go on to define and use your `hasInvalidProperties()` function however you want, using `keysOfV`.  Perhaps like this:\r\n\r\n    function hasInvalidProperties(x: object): x is { [K in keyof V]: Record&lt;K, any&gt; }[keyof V] {\r\n        return Object.keys(x).some(k =&gt; hasInvalidProperties.badKeySet.has(k));\r\n    }\r\n    hasInvalidProperties.badKeySet = new Set(keysOfV) as Set&lt;string&gt;;\r\n\r\n    /// test\r\n\r\n    function getDataFromRequest(): object {\r\n        return Math.random() &lt; 0.5 ? { c: &quot;okay&quot; } : { a: &quot;bad&quot; };\r\n    }\r\n    const x = getDataFromRequest();\r\n    if (hasInvalidProperties(x)) {\r\n        console.log(&quot;not okay&quot;);\r\n        throw new Error();\r\n    }\r\n    console.log(&quot;okay&quot;);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe main event though is what happens when `keysOfV` is wrong.  Here&#39;s what happens when it&#39;s missing an entry:\r\n\r\n    const keysOfV = [&quot;a&quot;] as const;\r\n    type MutuallyAssignable&lt;T extends U, U extends V, V = T&gt; = void;\r\n    // the following line will give an error if keysOfV is wrong\r\n    type KeysOfVIsGood = MutuallyAssignable&lt;keyof V, typeof keysOfV[number]&gt;; // error!\r\n    // &quot;b&quot; is not assignable to &quot;a&quot; ------&gt; ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s what happens when it has an extra entry:\r\n\r\n    const keysOfV = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;] as const;\r\n    type MutuallyAssignable&lt;T extends U, U extends V, V = T&gt; = void;\r\n    // the following line will give an error if keysOfV is wrong\r\n    type KeysOfVIsGood = MutuallyAssignable&lt;keyof V, typeof keysOfV[number]&gt;; // error!\r\n    // &quot;c&quot; is not assignable to &quot;a&quot; | &quot;b&quot; ---------&gt; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nHopefully those error messages and locations are descriptive enough for you to understand how to fix it when `V` changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, hope that helps; good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?ssl=41&amp;ssc=76&amp;pln=37&amp;pc=1#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-KE4RRLE8SJMkqSZBU+RFEgpTxTFVRxdC9RNN87SdKBWJDCMYxUVMFwzHMSALBESwrGsGw0NsuzofCRzMKQpznJcxoBXcNbPG8HxfOYvwhQC4XAqCaT6kg0IdXCTkmEiJmouimL9DVOwAIRXFiVjeeK9EltSQKRcgFCaI4thIAAPo4zhIAAtHd933c0AB+L2vW970fU9+J2Yp0BwIgPzNQkRUGVplA0PQAP6WxJBcMZKJmTDEhSDINlCb2pHeA1znmK5PnUp4ZE+FcHVBX8oWAhFIJRVkuSxSUZRJdUE11N86VtB0XQbV2wxIKM4yFXIxVlqVpCLMsqwcNV-F1fsM1NS12htX4NxIFGjUvO8nzfAN-xhQd1NggYcoOFNctdXNCNohiWIrdQ63Gpt13NTwDHuAboIDCdNifg9d3PR9cn4kAA)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454380/how-do-i-use-typescript-to-validate-that-an-object-has-no-overlapping-properties/58454692#58454692","title":"How do I use TypeScript to validate that an object has no overlapping properties with an interface?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22712,"user_id":172363,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb96a4dcb7314d7c9993cbc824123be0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andrew Eisenberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/172363/andrew-eisenberg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571420640,"post_id":58454869,"comment_id":103248779,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454380/how-do-i-use-typescript-to-validate-that-an-object-has-no-overlapping-properties/58454869#comment103248779_58454869"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61257,"user_id":1426891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gFJE8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeff Bowman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1426891/jeff-bowman"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571416191,"creation_date":1571416191,"answer_id":58454869,"question_id":58454380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58454869","body_markdown":"If you&#39;re willing to use [transformers](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13764), you could get the list of properties on an interface at compile time, which would then resolve to a runtime list of strings.

This part is where the problem is.  The query here takes 80-90 seconds to go through ~65,000 rows.\r\n\r\nAnd the `JoinPRNTables` method will only get worse as I further develop it, because I need data on about 5-6 related tables I haven&#39;t yet `Included()`ed.  Due to the use case of my application, every query will always need data from all the included tables, that&#39;s not something I can get around.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace Company.Domain.Application.Models\r\n{\r\n    using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;\r\n\r\n    public class ProvContext : DbContext\r\n    {\r\n        private string _state;\r\n\r\n        public ProvContext(State state)\r\n        {\r\n            _state = state.ToString().ToUpper();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public DbSet&lt;Provider&gt; Provider { get; set; }\r\n        public DbSet&lt;ServLocation&gt; ServLocation { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)\r\n        {\r\n            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(\r\n                $&quot;server=SERVER;database=DATABASE_{_state};trusted_connection=true;&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the Provider model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnamespace Company.Domain.Application.Models\r\n{\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;\r\n    using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema;\r\n\r\n    [Table(&quot;TABLE&quot;, Schema = &quot;SCHEMA&quot;)]\r\n    public class PRN_Provider\r\n    {\r\n        [Key]\r\n        public int ProvID { get; set; }\r\n        public PRN_ServLocation PRN_ServLocation { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Display(Name = &quot;First Name&quot;)]\r\n        [StringLength(100)]\r\n        public string FirstName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Display(Name = &quot;Middle Name&quot;)]\r\n        [StringLength(100)]\r\n        public string MiddleName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [Display(Name = &quot;Last Name&quot;)]\r\n        [StringLength(100)]\r\n        public string LastName { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        //... more of the same structure for fields\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way I can cut this query time down?  When I call it as `QueryBy&lt;PRN_Provider&gt;.Name(state, &quot;JOHN&quot;, &quot;SMITH&quot;).FirstOrDefault().FirstName`, it takes 90 seconds, and personal information like FirstName, etc are all on the first and only table being used at the moment, so for now there are no JOINs or related tables being used.  My Scrum master is telling me 90 seconds is alright, but I&#39;d still like to know if there&#39;s a way to cut the the time down.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454362/ef-takes-90-seconds-to-do-a-one-table-query","title":"EF takes ~90 seconds to do a one table query"},{"tags":["google-apps-script","google-apps-marketplace","chrome-web-store","google-apps-script-addon"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3360,"user_id":11599789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4650ead58d59d090529a6f31ab3462cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ziganotschka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11599789/ziganotschka"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571644597,"post_id":58454360,"comment_id":103295620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454360/google-apps-script-gas-simple-oninstalle-trigger-runs-in-authmode-none#comment103295620_58454360"}],"owner":{"reputation":1094,"user_id":5160136,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/46a8e61b14e3a351c8ee70c7e3d8f09d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JShinigami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5160136/jshinigami"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571414085,"creation_date":1571414085,"question_id":58454360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454360","body_markdown":"Based on the official Google documentation, the simple onInstall(e) trigger always runs in AuthMode.FULL:\r\n\r\n...

I&#39;m assuming they discovered the auth flow by using APK decompiling tools. \r\n\r\nSo yes an attacker can reverse engineer your APK and then understand your work flow, and for that they can use an Open Source tool, like the [Mobile Security Framework](https://github.com/MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF):\r\n\r\n&gt; Mobile Security Framework is an automated, all-in-one mobile application (Android/iOS/Windows) pen-testing framework capable of performing static analysis, dynamic analysis, malware analysis and web API testing.\r\n\r\nUsing this tool or another one to de-compile your APK, they can understand what method returns the JWT token, and then at runtime they can hook an instrumentation framwework, like Frida or Xposed to this method to be able to extract the JWT token, this in a device they control. \r\n\r\n[Frida](https://www.frida.re/)\r\n&gt; Inject your own scripts into black box processes. Hook any function, spy on crypto APIs or trace private application code, no source code needed. Edit, hit save, and instantly see the results. All without compilation steps or program restarts.\r\n\r\n[xPosed](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)\r\n&gt; Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs. That&#39;s great because it means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without any changes (as long as the original code was not changed too much). It&#39;s also easy to undo.\r\n\r\nAnother more sophisticated approach that can be used by an attacker is to setup a captive portal for free WiFi in a public space, where they may trick the user into install another mobile app that have embedded an instrumentation framework, that will extract the JWT token and send it to a Command and Control Server(C&amp;CS). Later they can used the C&amp;CS to launch automated attacks with the stolen JWT tokens or just perform manual attacks against your APIs as the genuine user.\r\n\r\n[Command and Control Server](https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/definition/command-and-control-server):\r\n\r\n&gt; A command-and-control [C&amp;C] server is a computer controlled by an attacker or cybercriminal which is used to send commands to systems compromised by malware and receive stolen data from a target network. Many campaigns have been found using cloud-based services, such as webmail and file-sharing services, as C&amp;C servers to blend in with normal traffic and avoid detection.\r\n\r\n## MitM Attack\r\n\r\n&gt; and are calling the APIs using tools like Postman.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to grab a JWT token is for the attacker to perform a MitM attack in a device he controls, and then he can just launch automated or manual attacks.\r\n\r\nA Open Source proxy tool for MitM attacks is the [mitmproxy](https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/):\r\n&gt; An interactive TLS-capable intercepting HTTP proxy for penetration testers and software developers.\r\n\r\nYou can see how to use it to extract a secret from a request in the article I wrote [Steal that API key with a MitM Attack](https://blog.approov.io/steal-that-api-key-with-a-man-in-the-middle-attack):\r\n\r\n&gt; So, in this article you will learn how to setup and run a MitM attack to intercept https traffic in a mobile device under your control, so that you can steal the API key. Finally, you will see at a high level how MitM attacks can be mitigated.\r\n\r\nLaunching a MitM attack with the use of a captive portal is also possible, and here the attacker will trick the user to download its own certificates to the user device, but since Android API level 24 your mobile app is only trusting on the system certificates, unless you explicit tell in the network security config file that it can trust in user supplied certificates. So if you don&#39;t have users in old devices and your app doesn&#39;t explicit opt-in to trust in user supplied certificates, you are safe against this attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Possible Solutions\r\n\r\n&gt; I&#39;m wondering what approach I can take to solve this problem either by detecting violators so I can ban them, or preventing it altogether. \r\n\r\nYou can go with basic API defenses or with some more advanced ones, but I think what you are in need is a Mobile App Attestation solution, but lets walk first each of your possible solutions, but before we dive in the possible solutions, lets&#39; first fix a common lack of knowledge among developers.\r\n\r\n## The Who vs What Is Accessing the API Server\r\n\r\nA usual issue among developers is that they are not aware of the difference between **WHO** vs **WHAT** is accessing the API server, and this is crucial to understand how you can defend against API attacks vs Mobile App attacks.\r\n\r\nFor a better understanding off the difference between **WHO** vs **WHAT** is accessing your API server, I recommend you to read [this section](https://blog.approov.io/why-does-your-mobile-app-need-an-api-key#api-who-vs-what) of my article, but I will extract here some lines of it:\r\n\r\n&gt; The **who** is the user of the mobile app that we can authenticate, authorize and identify in several ways, like using OpenID Connect or OAUTH2 flows.\r\n\r\n&gt; The **what** is the thing making the request to the API server. Is it really a genuine instance of your mobile app, or is a bot, an automated script or an attacker manually poking around your API server with a tool like Postman?\r\n\r\n\r\n## The Basic API Security Defenses\r\n\r\nNow that you understand the difference between **who** vs **what** is accessing your API server you may want to go an read [my article]((https://dev.to/exadra37/the-top-6-mobile-api-protection-techniques-are-they-enough-3mhn).\r\n) about the basic techniques to secure an API:\r\n\r\n&gt; In this article we will explore the most common techniques used to protect an API, including how important it is to use HTTPS to protect the communication channel between mobile app and API, how API keys are used to identify the mobile app on each API request, how user agents, captchas and IP addresses are used for bot mitigation, and finally how user authentication is important for the mobile security and api security. We will discuss each of these techniques and discuss how they impact the business risk profile, i.e. how easy they are get around.\r\n\r\n\r\n## More Advanced API Security Defenses\r\n\r\nYou can start by read this series of articles on [Mobile API Security Techniques](https://blog.approov.io/tag/a-series-mobile-api-security) to understand how API keys, HMAC, OAUTH and [certificate pinning](https://blog.approov.io/securing-https-with-certificate-pinning-on-android) can be used to enhance the security and at same time how they can be abused/defeated.\r\n\r\nAfterwards and depending on your budget and resources you may employ an array of different approaches and techniques to defend your API server, and I will start to enumerate some of the most usual ones.\r\n\r\nYou can start with [reCaptcha V3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html), followed by [Web Application Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall)(WAF) and finally if you can afford it a [User Behavior Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_behavior_analytics)(UBA) solution.\r\n\r\nGoogle [reCAPTCHA V3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html):\r\n\r\n&gt; reCAPTCHA is a free service that protects your website from spam and abuse. reCAPTCHA uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to keep automated software from engaging in abusive activities on your site. It does this while letting your valid users pass through with ease.\r\n\r\n&gt; ...helps you detect abusive traffic on your website without any user friction. It returns a score based on the interactions with your website and provides you more flexibility to take appropriate actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[WAF - Web Application Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_firewall):\r\n\r\n&gt; A web application firewall (or WAF) filters, monitors, and blocks HTTP traffic to and from a web application. A WAF is differentiated from a regular firewall in that a WAF is able to filter the content of specific web applications while regular firewalls serve as a safety gate between servers. By inspecting HTTP traffic, it can prevent attacks stemming from web application security flaws, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and security misconfigurations.\r\n\r\n[UBA - User Behavior Analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_behavior_analytics):\r\n\r\n&gt; User behavior analytics (UBA) as defined by Gartner is a cybersecurity process about detection of insider threats, targeted attacks, and financial fraud. UBA solutions look at patterns of human behavior, and then apply algorithms and statistical analysis to detect meaningful anomalies from those patterns—anomalies that indicate potential threats. Instead of tracking devices or security events, UBA tracks a system&#39;s users. Big data platforms like Apache Hadoop are increasing UBA functionality by allowing them to analyze petabytes worth of data to detect insider threats and advanced persistent threats.\r\n\r\nAll this solutions work based on a negative identification model, by other words they try their best to differentiate the bad from the good by identifying what is bad, not what is good, thus they are prone to false positives, despite of the advanced technology used by some of them, like machine learning and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nSo you may find yourself more often than not in having to relax how you block the access to the API server in order to not affect the good users. This also means that this solutions require constant monitoring to validate that the false positives are not blocking your legit users and that at same time they are properly keeping at bay the unauthorized ones.\r\n\r\nRegarding APIs serving mobile apps a positive identification model can be used by implementing a Mobile App Attestation solution that attests the integrity of your mobile app and device its running on before any request is made to the API server.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Mobile App attestation\r\n\r\nFinally if you have the resources you can go even further, by building your own [Mobile APP Attestation](https://blog.approov.io/how-to-protect-against-certificate-pinning-bypassing#mobile-app-attestation) solution:\r\n\r\n&gt; The role of a Mobile App Attestation service is to authenticate what is sending the requests, thus only responding to requests coming from genuine mobile app instances and rejecting all other requests from unauthorized sources.\r\n\r\n&gt; In order to know what is sending the requests to the API server, a Mobile App Attestation service, at run-time, will identify with high confidence that your mobile app is present, has not been tampered/repackaged, is not running in a rooted device, has not been hooked into by an instrumentation framework(Frida, xPosed, Cydia, etc.), and is not the object of a Man in the Middle Attack (MitM). This is achieved by running an SDK in the background that will communicate with a service running in the cloud to attest the integrity of the mobile app and device it is running on.\r\n\r\n&gt; On a successful attestation of the mobile app integrity, a short time lived JWT token is issued and signed with a secret that only the API server and the Mobile App Attestation service in the cloud know. In the case that attestation fails the JWT token is signed with an incorrect secret. Since the secret used by the Mobile App Attestation service is not known by the mobile app, it is not possible to reverse engineer it at run-time even when the app has been tampered with, is running in a rooted device or communicating over a connection that is the target of a MitM attack.\r\n\r\n&gt; The mobile app must send the JWT token in the header of every API request. This allows the API server to only serve requests when it can verify that the JWT token was signed with the shared secret and that it has not expired. All other requests will be refused. In other words a valid JWT token tells the API server that what is making the request is the genuine mobile app uploaded to the Google or Apple store, while an invalid or missing JWT token means that what is making the request is not authorized to do so, because it may be a bot, a repackaged app or an attacker making a MitM attack.\r\n\r\n&gt; A great benefit of using a Mobile App Attestation service is its proactive and positive authentication model, which does not create false positives, and thus does not block legitimate users while it keeps the bad guys at bay.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the best solution is defense in depth, by applying as many layers as you can, so that you increase the time, effort and skill-set necessary to by pass all your security layers, thus keeping at bay the script kids and occasionally hackers from abusing your service.\r\n\r\nSo you should employ has much techniques as possible in both sides of the equation, mobile app and API, like the ones you have learned when reading the articles I have linked: HTTPS, API keys, User Agents, Captchas, Rate Limiting, OAuth, HMAC, Certificate Pinning, Code Obfuscation, JNI/NDK to hide secretes, WAF, UBA, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the solution to use in order to protect your API server must be chosen in accordance with the value of what you are trying to protect and the legal requirements for that type of data, like the GDPR regulations in Europe.\r\n\r\n## Going the Extra Mile\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend you, to also take a look into the \r\n[OWASP Mobile Security Project - Top 10 risks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Project#Top_Ten_Mobile_Risks)\r\n\r\n&gt; The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454335/jwt-secured-rest-apis-being-called-outside-of-android-app/58484938#58484938","title":"JWT Secured REST APIs being called outside of Android app"}],"owner":{"reputation":134,"user_id":1974602,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f741a80424a367411ad299486affad9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"thebighoncho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1974602/thebighoncho"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571655776,"creation_date":1571413979,"question_id":58454335,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454335","body_markdown":"I have a fairly popular android app with hundreds of daily users.

This is causing issues as it creates an uneven playing field for legitimate users.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m wondering what approach I can take to solve this problem either by detecting violators so I can ban them, or preventing it altogether. \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454335/jwt-secured-rest-apis-being-called-outside-of-android-app","title":"JWT Secured REST APIs being called outside of Android app"},{"tags":["c++","binary-tree","heap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571414226,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246097,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246097_58454334"},{"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"edited":false,"score":5,"creation_date":1571414255,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246109,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246109_58454334"},{"owner":{"reputation":1224,"user_id":3166476,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tU6SH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lakeweb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166476/lakeweb"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571414332,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246147_58454334"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":11125035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WG_Ju0YDB9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACevoQM2keDLmTQt0eI2h-s3AguR2ScgWA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11125035/cristyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414601,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246298_58454334"},{"owner":{"reputation":30304,"user_id":898348,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13b3f2c44ba8449bd60764d07f4538dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jabberwocky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/898348/jabberwocky"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414613,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246302,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246302_58454334"},{"owner":{"reputation":30304,"user_id":898348,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13b3f2c44ba8449bd60764d07f4538dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jabberwocky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/898348/jabberwocky"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571414867,"post_id":58454334,"comment_id":103246414,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454334/after-browsing-binary-tree-appears-something-unuseful#comment103246414_58454334"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571414622,"creation_date":1571414622,"answer_id":58454485,"question_id":58454334,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58454485","body_markdown":"The computer adds an extra node because you told it to:\r\n\r\n    ARB *rad=0;\r\n    int x;

as we discussed in the comments, you can&#39;t *really* do what you&#39;re trying to do. There are a couple ideas I have in mind that might help you, though.\r\n\r\n## Option 1 ##\r\nIf you know the size of the file you&#39;re trying to download you could create a file of the needed size and overwrite with the bytes you download.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith open(&quot;some_file_name&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:\r\n    f.truncate(some_size)\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```python\r\nwith open(&quot;some_file_name&quot;, &quot;wb&quot;) as f:\r\n    f.seek(some_size - 1)\r\n    f.write(&#39;\\0&#39;)\r\n```\r\n*Note that if a specified size exceeds the file’s current size, the result is platform-dependent: possibilities include that the file may remain unchanged, increase to the specified size as if zero-filled, or increase to the specified size with undefined new content.*\r\n\r\nso as you download parts you can overwrite the specific chunk of bytes with\r\n```python\r\nwith open(&quot;some_file_name&quot;, &quot;r+b&quot;) as f:\r\n    f.seek(offset)\r\n    f.write(data_chunk)\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Option 2##\r\n\r\nDecided how much memory you&#39;re willing to use and only download a certain number of parts in order at a time.\r\n\r\nexample: if you decided you only want to use 1GB and you want to download a large file in chunks of 250 MB\r\n\r\n* Start downloading the first 4 chunks in parallel.\r\n* When chunk 1 finishes downloading, you can write it to disk and start downloading chunk 5.\r\n* if a chunk finishes downloading before a lower chunk (e.g. 2 finishes before 1) hold it in memory until the other chunk finishes\r\n* this limits the memory usage to 1 GB because no more than four 250 MB chunks are downloading at once\r\n\r\n##Option 3##\r\n\r\nwrite to temporary files (as you mentioned in your original question) but keep them in a location where the user probably won&#39;t see them such as your system&#39;s temp directory or in a hidden directory created by your program\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454330/how-to-download-a-big-file-in-several-simultaneous-chunks-and-save-them-to-the-s/58456020#58456020","title":"How to download a big file in several simultaneous chunks and save them to the same file in Python?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571430926,"post_id":58456247,"comment_id":103252691,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454330/how-to-download-a-big-file-in-several-simultaneous-chunks-and-save-them-to-the-s/58456247#comment103252691_58456247"},{"owner":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571431137,"post_id":58456247,"comment_id":103252756,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454330/how-to-download-a-big-file-in-several-simultaneous-chunks-and-save-them-to-the-s/58456247#comment103252756_58456247"},{"owner":{"reputation":9561,"user_id":1076479,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLQUX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gil Hamilton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1076479/gil-hamilton"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571438884,"post_id":58456247,"comment_id":103254734,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454330/how-to-download-a-big-file-in-several-simultaneous-chunks-and-save-them-to-the-s/58456247#comment103254734_58456247"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9561,"user_id":1076479,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLQUX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gil Hamilton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1076479/gil-hamilton"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9561,"user_id":1076479,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":20,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eLQUX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gil Hamilton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1076479/gil-hamilton"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571439006,"last_edit_date":1571439006,"creation_date":1571422653,"answer_id":58456247,"question_id":58454330,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58456247","body_markdown":"You should be able to do this easily, at least on a unix/linux system. The key is that you should create the file once in thread 1, opening it for writing. Then you need to *re-open* the file again N more times (also for write, but never for append) -- so that you get an independent file descriptor for each thread to use. \r\n\r\nNext, have each thread `lseek` to the appropriate starting position within the file using its own file descriptor, and then it can begin writing chunks to the file as received from the server. (You should be able to use standard python file objects and their `seek` method too as long as you&#39;re using binary I/O.) \r\n\r\nThis works because each file descriptor has an independent file pointer, and on all unix systems, the file pointer should automatically advance as you write. Also, there is no problem with having gaps in the file; the OS should handle that fine.\r\n\r\nIOW, for a 1GB file with 5 threads:\r\n\r\n    thread 1, fd 1, position 0 (writing through 200MB-1)\r\n    thread 2, fd 2, position 200MB (through 400MB-1)\r\n    ...\r\n    thread 5, fd 5, position 800MB (through 1GB-1)\r\n\r\n\r\nCode for a thread in python (assuming you&#39;ve already created the file in the main thread) can be as simple as:\r\n\r\n    with open(&quot;the_file&quot;, &quot;r+b&quot;) as myfile:   # open for update\r\n        myfile.seek(my_starting_pos)\r\n        while ...:\r\n             next_chunk = recv_from_server()\r\n             myfile.write(next_chunk)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454330/how-to-download-a-big-file-in-several-simultaneous-chunks-and-save-them-to-the-s/58456247#58456247","title":"How to download a big file in several simultaneous chunks and save them to the same file in Python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11779356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-GuddppiNvpM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rey63Ax9QQp6mExJPe5MJvhR8Oq3g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"DaviZ K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11779356/daviz-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571686104,"creation_date":1571413961,"last_edit_date":1571686104,"question_id":58454330,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454330","body_markdown":"I am using PyCurl, range http header and Python Threads, so if I need to download 1 gb file and want to use for example 5 connections to the server to speed the process up, I just divide 1 gb in five parts, and create five threads which download 1/5 per thread, save that 1/5 to a &quot;.part&quot; file, and when all the 5 threads are done and download its 1/5 file, I just join all the parts and recreate the 1 gb file. \r\n\r\nMy question is: how can I download the file in the same 5 chunks, but instead of save every chunk to a temp file and then join all the files into the original file, just download the 5 parts and save the parts to the a 1gb file directly?

The &quot;**orders**&quot; table contains a foreign key called &quot;**client_id_fk**&quot; that refers to the primary key of the &quot;**clients**&quot; table, called &quot;**client_id**&quot;. Now, suppose I capture events that happen on the tables, like the *inserts*, the *updates* and the *deletes*, and I pass all of these to an unbounded Flink DataStream. When the events come inside the Flink DataStream, it writes them inside another storage, e.g. an Apache Kafka topic. \r\n\r\nSuppose that inside &quot;**clients**&quot; are added five new records: **A, B, C, D, E**, and that the Flink DataStream receives these records in that precise order. Now, suppose that inside &quot;**orders**&quot; is added the record **O_A**, referred to the **A** client; then, this event is also pushed inside the Flink DataStream. As I have described before, every event will be written directly inside the Kafka topic when it arrives inside the DataStream; here comes my question: is there a way in Apache Flink to *store* the event **A** until the event **O_A** arrives, then *join* them, and than write them inside the Kafka topic? Clearly, I know that I have to wait for **O_A** before write **A** inside the topic.\r\n\r\nTo recap, the Flink DataStream receives the following events in the following order:\r\n\r\n**A, B, C, D, E, O_A**\r\n\r\nWhen it receives the event **A**, instead of writing it inside the Apache Kafka topic, it should store it and wait until the event **O_A** arrives; then, it joins them, and then it writes them inside the topic.\r\n\r\nI thank you all in advance, would it be also possible to have an intuitive snippet written using the Java Apache Flink API that shows how to realize that?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454282/store-an-element-x-of-an-unbounded-stream-until-the-y-element-arrives-then-join","title":"Store an element X of an unbounded stream until the Y element arrives, then join them"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","printing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":5423513,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/190240521309466/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jos&#233; Lopez Coronado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5423513/jos%c3%a9-lopez-coronado"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571414187,"post_id":58454278,"comment_id":103246075,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454278/when-printing-just-showing-first-page-text#comment103246075_58454278"}],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":8656390,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QFTGgjBNBpg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADE/TofPb4nq-mY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Fernando Palma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8656390/fernando-palma"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571413764,"creation_date":1571413764,"question_id":58454278,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454278","body_markdown":"I am using a link to send the user to a printable html.

And the second page is my JS function\r\n\r\nI am trying to use a printable css style sheet, but don&#39;t manage to do page-breaks\r\n\r\nprintable.html\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n  &lt;section class=&quot;invoice&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-lg-12&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;small class=&quot;float-right&quot;&gt;Date: 12-10-11&lt;/small&gt;\r\n        &lt;br&gt;\r\n        &lt;small&gt;No. 564198415641&lt;/small&gt;\r\n        &lt;h2 class=&quot;page-header&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;img style=&quot;width:300px;&quot; src=&quot;/images/logo2x.png&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;br&gt;\r\n        &lt;/h2&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;h4 class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n    &lt;h4 class=&quot;text-center&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:50px;&quot;&gt;model.project.platform ASSIGMEMT AGREEMENT &lt;br&gt; BASIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row invoice-info&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-lg-12&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;ol&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;The Assign: The Lorem Ipsum&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;The System ID Number: 4854154848&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;System ID : 51654651&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Number: 64568744154&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;\r\n            Composition of the Claim:\r\n            &lt;ol&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;the part of the: 51654&lt;/li&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;Lorem 1854&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ol&gt;\r\n          &lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Lorem: 54&lt;/li&gt;\r\n          &lt;li&gt;Ipsum: 654&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ol&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;col-xs-12 col-lg-12&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;page-content&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;div class=&quot;main-content col-lg-12&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;content-area card&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div class=&quot;card-innr&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;card-head&quot;&gt;\r\n                      &lt;h1 class=&quot;card-title card-title-lg text-center&quot;&gt;\r\n                        ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT\r\n                        &lt;br&gt;\r\n                        GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n                      &lt;/h1&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;div class=&quot;main-content col-lg-12&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;content-area card&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div class=&quot;card-innr&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;card-head&quot;&gt;\r\n                      &lt;h4 class=&quot;card-title card-title-lg&quot;&gt;1.

It&#39;s quite difficult to change the form appearance based on data passed in via setData() and might have been what was causing you issues with your fieldsets and validation \r\n\r\nIf you wanted to have &quot;generic&quot; forms which are adaptable to different context&#39;s - that is possible I&#39;d implement it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php\r\nnamespace ConferenceTools\\Attendance\\Form;\r\n\r\nuse Zend\\Form\\Element\\DateTime;\r\nuse Zend\\Form\\Element\\Submit;\r\nuse Zend\\Form\\Form;\r\n\r\nclass DateTimeForm extends Form\r\n{\r\n    public function init()\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;add([\r\n            &#39;type&#39; =&gt; DateTime::class,\r\n            &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;datetime&#39;,\r\n            &#39;options&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;label&#39; =&gt; $this-&gt;getOption(&#39;fieldLabel&#39;),\r\n            ],\r\n            &#39;attributes&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;class&#39;=&gt; &#39;datetimepicker-input&#39;,\r\n                &#39;id&#39; =&gt; &quot;dtpicker&quot;,\r\n                &#39;data-toggle&#39; =&gt; &quot;datetimepicker&quot;,\r\n                &#39;data-target&#39; =&gt; &quot;#dtpicker&quot;,\r\n                &#39;autocomplete&#39; =&gt; &#39;off&#39;,\r\n            ],\r\n        ]);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a generic date time form use in this project: https://github.com/conferencetools/attendance-module/blob/master/src/Form/DateTimeForm.php\r\n\r\nThe differences to your form are the `$this-&gt;getOption(&#39;fieldLabel&#39;)` call, this is a better way to pass options into the form than using the constructor. It also builds the form in the init method instead of the constructor, this is important to make use of the options field and any custom form elements which won&#39;t be available until the class has been fully constructed.\r\n\r\nFor this to work properly, you need to retrieve it from the FormPluginManager (service name: &#39;Zend\\Form\\FormElementManager&#39;) which is a standard service locator. You can inject this into your controller in it&#39;s factory and then use it as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// in controller method\r\n$form = $this-&gt;formElementManager-&gt;get(FormName::class, [&#39;fieldLabel&#39; =&gt; &#39;Arrival time&#39;]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not quite how I do it in the project linked above; instead of injecting the formElementManager into every controller that needed it, I created a controller plugin which makes it available in every controller. (The code is the same, just in a plugin instead)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454274/is-it-a-bad-idea-to-manipulate-zend-forms-with-parameters-from-the-controller/58454780#58454780","title":"Is it a bad idea to manipulate zend forms with parameters from the controller?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":533,"user_id":1842846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pink9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ermenegildo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1842846/ermenegildo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":533,"user_id":1842846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pink9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ermenegildo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1842846/ermenegildo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571810035,"last_edit_date":1571810035,"creation_date":1571746013,"answer_id":58503946,"question_id":58454274,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58503946","body_markdown":"Although user999305 is correct (and deserve to be marked as solution), seeing your comment and the confusion in the understaning, I&#39;d like to give you an extended example of what he said.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s you have the following situation:\r\n\r\n* **Module**: `FormModule`\r\n* **Controller**: `FormController`\r\n* **Form**: `ComposedForm`\r\n\r\nIn the controller, you have two actions, `withTitleAction` and `withoutTitleAction`. Both use `ComposedForm`. Since you need `ComposedForm` in your `FormController`, you need to instantiate it using `FormPluginManager` (you can read more about it [in the docs][1])\r\n\r\nYou have now two options on how to get the form in your controller:\r\n\r\n- you get it through a controller plugin (as proposed at the end by user999305, and which is actually a smart idea)\r\n- you inject the `FormPluginManager` in your controller\r\n\r\n### Inject `FormPluginManager` in controller\r\nFirst off, you must create a factory for the controller:\r\n\r\n**Controller/FormControllerFactory.php**\r\n```php\r\nnamespace FormModule\\Controller;\r\n\r\nuse Interop\\Container\\ContainerInterface;\r\nuse Zend\\ServiceManager\\Factory\\FactoryInterface;\r\n\r\nclass FormControllerFactory implements FactoryInterface {\r\n\r\n    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container, $requestedName, array $options = null) {\r\n        $formPluginManager = $container-&gt;get(&#39;FormElementManager&#39;);\r\n        return new FormController($container, $options);\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nModule&#39;s configuration must be updated, in order for the application to know how to create the controller\r\n\r\n**module.config.php**\r\n```php\r\n&#39;controllers&#39; =&gt; [\r\n    &#39;factories&#39; =&gt; [\r\n        Controller\\FormController::class =&gt; Controller\\FormControllerFactory::class\r\n    ]\r\n],\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd now, just update the controller to receive the new parameter:\r\n\r\n**Controller/FormController.php**\r\n```php\r\nnamespace FormModule\\Controller;\r\n\r\nuse Zend\\Form\\FormElementManager;\r\nuse Zend\\Mvc\\Controller\\AbstractActionController;\r\n\r\nclass FormController extends AbstractActionController {\r\n\r\n    private $formManager;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(FormElementManager $formManager) {\r\n        $this-&gt;formManager = $formManager;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, implement the two actions:\r\n\r\n**Controller/FormController.php**\r\n```php    \r\npublic function withTitleAction(){\r\n    $options = [&#39;hasTitle&#39; =&gt; true];\r\n    $form = $this-&gt;formManager-&gt;get(\\FormModule\\Form\\ComposedForm::class, $options);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic function withoutTitleAction(){\r\n    $options = [&#39;hasTitle&#39; =&gt; false];\r\n    $form = $this-&gt;formManager-&gt;get(\\FormModule\\Form\\ComposedForm::class, $options);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, your form:\r\n\r\n**Form/ComposedForm.php**\r\n```php\r\nnamespace FormModule\\Form;\r\n\r\nuse Zend\\Form\\Form;\r\nuse Zend\\InputFilter\\InputFilterProviderInterface;\r\n\r\nclass ComposedForm extends Form {\r\n\r\n    public function __construct($name = null, $options = []) {\r\n        // DO NOT FORGET THIS\r\n        parent::__construct($name, $options);\r\n\r\n        // The constructor is not really needed, unless you have some\r\n        // dependencies or you have to do something particular, like\r\n        // setting the hydrator, form attributes, form object, ...\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function init() {\r\n        parent::init();\r\n\r\n        if ($this-&gt;getOption(&#39;hasTitle&#39;)) {\r\n            $this-&gt;add([\r\n                &#39;type&#39; =&gt; &#39;text&#39;,\r\n                &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;title&#39;,\r\n                &#39;options&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                    &#39;label&#39; =&gt; &#39;text&#39;,\r\n                    &#39;placeholder&#39; =&gt; &#39;Test&#39;,\r\n                ],\r\n            ]);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope this will help you\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.zendframework.com/zend-form/advanced/#creating-custom-elements","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454274/is-it-a-bad-idea-to-manipulate-zend-forms-with-parameters-from-the-controller/58503946#58503946","title":"Is it a bad idea to manipulate zend forms with parameters from the controller?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12158654,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e9c9b5e688a6544285acacd59ed805d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"s47c953","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12158654/s47c953"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571810035,"creation_date":1571413755,"question_id":58454274,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454274","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently creating forms for my project and already wasted time with fieldsets.

Set `quality` parameter as `auto` (**q_auto** in URLs) to automatically adjust the quality of the image for the right balance between quality and size\r\n 2. Set `fetch_format` parameter as `auto` (**f_auto** in URLs) to automatically choose the best format depending on the browser.\r\n 3. Adjusting the height and width to necessary dimensions being rendered on the page.\r\n\r\nExample: https://res.cloudinary.com/demo/image/upload/q_auto,f_auto,w_500/bike.jpg\r\n\r\n**Source (and more info)**: https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_optimization).\r\n\r\nBut if you need to re-upload the content and keep the same `public_id`, the easiest solution would be to use their APIs.

Retrieve the assets that need to be re-uploaded using the [Admin APIs get resources call](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/admin_api#get_resources). I would suggest breaking these down by `resource_type` and I would also include the parameters `tags` set as `true` and `context` set as `true` if being used. **Note** The Admin API is rate limited so check what usage limit is associated to your plan [here](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/admin_api#usage_limits). Store these in an array for use later. The response should include `public_id`, `url`, `tags`, `context`, etc...\r\n 2. Iterate over the previous array and use the [Upload API&#39;s upload method](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_upload_api_reference#upload_method) to re-upload the content using the same parameters retrieved earlier (`public_id`, `url`, `tags`, `context`, etc.. e.g. \r\n\r\n        current_assets = [...]\r\n        for (asset in current_assets) {\r\n            result = cloudinary.v2.uploader.upload(\r\n                asset[&#39;url&#39;], \r\n                { public_id: asset[&#39;public_id&#39;], tags: asset[&#39;tags&#39;], context: assets[&#39;context&#39;]\r\n                // include any incoming transformations to apply to the asset during upload\r\n                },\r\n                (err, res) =&gt; {\r\n                    if (err) console.log(err);\r\n                console.log(res);\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n\r\n**Source**: https://cloudinary.com/documentation/upload_images?query=incoming&amp;c_query=Incoming%20transformations#incoming_transformations\r\n        \r\n\r\n\r\n

They should be assigned a default of 0.\r\n\r\nThe table in question does NOT have a PK (primary key).\r\n\r\nLast but not least you need (want) to add a timestamp column. Keep in mind that this is really what we call a “row version” column (so it not a date/time column, but a timestamp column). Adding this column will help access determine if a record been changed, and this is especially the case for any table/form in Access that allows editing of “real” number data types (single, double). If access does not find a timestamp column, then it reverts to a column by column comparison to determine table changes, and due to how computers handle “real” numbers (with rounding), then such comparisons often fail.\r\n\r\nSo, check for the above 3 issues. You likely should re-run the linked table manager have making any changes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454256/linked-sql-servers-table-shows-all-fields-as-deleted-but-when-converted-to-lo/58457313#58457313","title":"Linked SQL Server&#39;s table shows all fields as #Deleted, but when converted to local, all information is there"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":11614210,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WAX3qty4VnA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACQ4/dFQHeLiX-WA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rafael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11614210/rafael"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21361,"user_id":3820271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZxCoE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3820271/andre"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571827793,"creation_date":1571413697,"last_edit_date":1571827793,"question_id":58454256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454256","body_markdown":"My company has a really old Access 2003 .ADP front-end connected to an on-premise SQL Server.

so let&#39;s step through what happens in order:\r\n\r\n1. The parent component is created, triggering the `created` hook and initiating the data load from the server.\r\n2. The parent component renders, creating the child components. The prop value for `spec` will be `null` as the data hasn&#39;t loaded yet and `singleProductSpec` is still `null`.\r\n3. The `created` hook for `single-product-spec` runs. As `this.spec` is `null` I&#39;d imagine this throws an error, though no error was mentioned in the question.\r\n4. At some point in the future the data load completes, updating the value of `singleProductSpec`. It is a rendering dependency of the parent component, so that component will be added to the rendering queue.\r\n5. The parent component will re-render. The new value of `singleProductSpec` will be passed as the `spec` prop to `single-product-spec`. A new instance of `single-product-spec` will **not** be created, it will just re-use the one it created it first rendered.\r\n\r\nAt that point nothing else will happen. The `created` hook of `single-product-spec` won&#39;t re-run as it hasn&#39;t just been created.\r\n\r\nWhen you edit the source code of the child component it will trigger a hot-reload of that component. The exact effect of such a change will vary but often it will cause that child to be re-created without re-creating the parent. As the parent already has the data loaded from the server the newly created child will be have been passed the fully-populated `spec` value. This allows it to be read within the `created` hook.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of ways to solve this.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we could avoid creating the `single-product-spec` until the data is ready:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;product-spec v-if=&quot;singleProductSpec&quot; :spec=&quot;singleProductSpec&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will simply avoid creating the component during the initial render, so that when the child&#39;s `created` hook is run it has access to the data you want. This is probably the approach you should use.\r\n\r\nA second way to do it would be to use a `key`. Keys are used to pair up components across re-renders so that Vue knows which old component matches which new component. If the `key` changes then Vue will throw away the old child component and create a new one instead. As a new component is created it will run the `created` hook. This probably isn&#39;t the best approach for your scenario as it isn&#39;t clear what the child component should do when passed a `spec` of `null`.\r\n\r\nA third approach would be to use a `watch` in the child component. This would watch for when the value of `spec` changes and copy across the relevant values to the component&#39;s local data properties. While there are some occasions when using a `watch` like this is appropriate it usually indicates an underlying weakness in a component&#39;s design.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are other problems in your code...\r\n\r\n1. It isn&#39;t clear why you&#39;re copying the values from the prop into local data in the first place. You can just use the prop directly. If you&#39;re doing it just to give them shorter names then just use a computed property instead. The only legitimate reason for copying them like this is if the property values can be changed within the child and the prop is only used to pass an initial value. Even in that scenario you wouldn&#39;t use a `created` hook, you&#39;d just do it inside the `data` function. See https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-props.html#One-Way-Data-Flow.\r\n2. You&#39;re duplicating everything 5 times for the 5 tabs. This should be implemented using an array of objects, with each object containing all the relevant details for a tab.\r\n3. The properties `mesinActive` and `mesinTab` both represent the same underlying data. You shouldn&#39;t have both in `data`. At the very least one should be a computed property, though personally I&#39;d probably just get rid of `mesinTab` altogether. Instead use CSS classes to apply the relevant styling and just use `mesinActive` to decide which classes to apply (as you have elsewhere). Obviously the same applies to the other `xActive`/`xTab` properties.\r\n4. Your tabs are a form of single selection. Using 5 boolean values to represent one selection is not an appropriate data structure. The correct way to do this is to have a single property that identifies the current tab. The specifics can vary, it might hold the tab index, or the object representing the tab data, or an id representing the tab.\r\n5. You don&#39;t need to use `let self = this` with arrow functions. The `this` value is preserved from the surrounding scope.\r\n\r\nCorrectly implemented the code for `single-product-spec` should collapse down to almost nothing. You should be able to get rid of about 80% of the code. I would expect the method `openSpaceTab` to be a one-liner if you just use the appropriate data structures to hold all of your data.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nAs requested, here is a rewrite of your component taking into account points 1-4 from the &#39;other problems&#39;

The problem is, it only loads the props data, when I change the code in my text editor (it&#39;s strange, I know). I began to realize this when I start to debugging, and when I change my code in single-product-spec component, the props data then began start to load. And if i don&#39;t change my single-product-spec component code, the props data won&#39;t load no matter how long i wait.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454247/vue-child-component-wont-change-after-receiving-props-from-parents","title":"Vue: child component won&#39;t change after receiving props
