If you&#39;re not sure what deferred execution is, in a nutshell it&#39;s a mechanism that only runs the LINQ query when you ask for the results rather than when you make the statements that comprise the query. \r\n\r\nIn essence this means we can have code like:\r\n\r\n    //always adults \r\n    var p = person.Where(x =&gt; x.Age &gt; 18);\r\n\r\n    //we maybe filter on these\r\n    if(email != null)\r\n      p = p.Where(x =&gt; x.Email == email);\r\n    if(socialSN != null)\r\n      p = p.Where(x =&gt; x.SSN == socialSN);\r\n\r\n    var r = p.ToList();  //the query is only actually run now\r\n\r\nThe multiple calls to `where` here are cumulative; they will conceptually build a where clause but not execute the query until ToList is called. At this point, if a database is in use then the db sees the query with all its Where clauses and can leverage indexes and statistics \r\n\r\nIf we were to use ToList after every Where, then the first Where would hit the db and it&#39;s whole dataset would download to the client app, and the runtime would set about converting an enumerable to a list (a lot of copying and memory allocating). The subsequent Where would filter the list in the client app, enumerating it but then converting it to a list again - the big problem being its done in the memory of the client app as some naive unindexed loop, and all those millions of dollars of r&amp;d Microsoft poured into making their SQL Server query optimizer pull huge amounts of data very quickly, are wasted :)\r\n\r\nConsider also that that first clause in my example set- Age&gt;18 could be huge; a million people of a spread of ages over age 12, for example - A large amount of data is true for that predicate. Email or SSN would be a far smaller dataset, probably indexed etc. It&#39;s a contrived example sure but hopefully well illustrates the point about performance; by ToList()ing too early we end up downloading too much data","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123141/how-to-retrieve-data-from-very-large-datasets-with-optional-parameters/58124467#58124467","title":"How to retrieve data from very large datasets with optional parameters?"}],"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":8100128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/386688965bda59d244cbd58d219d54bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"m1547","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8100128/m1547"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58124467,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569530952,"creation_date":1569524252,"question_id":58123141,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58123141","body_markdown":"I have an app that retrieves data requested by the user.

So I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s related to my permissions, but I could be wrong I suppose.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123127/facebook-v3-1-graph-api-page-roles-edge","title":"Facebook v3.1 graph api Page Roles edge"},{"tags":["json.net","deserialization","rename","jsonconverter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":87669,"user_id":10263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e51Ks.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10263/brian-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569540114,"post_id":58123116,"comment_id":102639826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123116/how-do-i-get-the-value-of-a-json-property-from-a-jproperty-in-json-net#comment102639826_58123116"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11475908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N64AKkGC-s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rflgY3Vnyg-tHP7Paeoek6h5iShQQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jens Bright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11475908/jens-bright"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":87669,"user_id":10263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e51Ks.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10263/brian-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569546261,"post_id":58123116,"comment_id":102640832,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123116/how-do-i-get-the-value-of-a-json-property-from-a-jproperty-in-json-net#comment102640832_58123116"},{"owner":{"reputation":87669,"user_id":10263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e51Ks.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10263/brian-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569561529,"post_id":58123116,"comment_id":102643769,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123116/how-do-i-get-the-value-of-a-json-property-from-a-jproperty-in-json-net#comment102643769_58123116"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11475908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N64AKkGC-s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rflgY3Vnyg-tHP7Paeoek6h5iShQQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jens Bright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11475908/jens-bright"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":87669,"user_id":10263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e51Ks.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Rogers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10263/brian-rogers"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569606541,"post_id":58123116,"comment_id":102665078,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123116/how-do-i-get-the-value-of-a-json-property-from-a-jproperty-in-json-net#comment102665078_58123116"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11475908,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7N64AKkGC-s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rflgY3Vnyg-tHP7Paeoek6h5iShQQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jens Bright","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11475908/jens-bright"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569524169,"creation_date":1569524169,"question_id":58123116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58123116","body_markdown":"I am working to create a JsonConverter and a ContractResolver that I can use to manage property and type serialization without using NewtonSoft attributes.\r\n\r\np.s., I am surprised these features are not already created somewhere\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a Contract Resolver that I think will work for the serialization step.

These are known as the Agent XPs.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable SQL Server Agent you must enable Agent XPs through the surface area configuration of SQL Server.  When installing SQL Server, if you setup the SQL Agent these will automatically be enabled so often these are enabled by default.\r\n\r\nSo, while Agent XPs refer to the collection of stored procedures [as documented here][2].  In practice people usually refer to Agent XPs as either being enabled meaning SQL Server Agent is configured and able to run versus disabled meaning the Agent feature is turned off and cannot be ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/agent/sql-server-agent?view=sql-server-2017\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/system-stored-procedures/sql-server-agent-stored-procedures-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123057/what-does-agent-xps-server-do/58125221#58125221","title":"What does Agent XPs Server do?"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":8049875,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g4LnD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alan Nunes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8049875/alan-nunes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58125221,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569535135,"creation_date":1569523895,"last_edit_date":1569529010,"question_id":58123057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58123057","body_markdown":"I would like to know what does Agent XPs Server do?

User can also delete cars. We want to bill the user based on the number of cars he/she has at the end of the month. \r\n\r\nSo as far as I have searched the strip documentation there are basically two types of plans in subscription based billing with stripe.\r\n1. Constant billing (something like that) where user is charged a constant amount each month.\r\n2. Metered billing where user is billed based on usage by creating usage Records (usage like number of API calls or time spent on website).\r\nThe problem is that neither of the two categories completely capture my scenario.   \r\n   \r\nA friend suggested making multiple subscriptions for each car and cancelling the subscription when car is deleted.

Is that even possible?\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123045/run-program-on-aws-server-from-browser","title":"Run program on AWS server from browser"},{"tags":["python","django","dictionary"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8683,"user_id":2142055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae033a065a69861fc53c6a322db6414?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Goyo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2142055/goyo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569527663,"post_id":58123043,"comment_id":102636333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123043/update-complex-dict-with-another-dict-with-different-formatting#comment102636333_58123043"},{"owner":{"reputation":1036,"user_id":3815432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3523270d3d2bdb908089a05957ccc711?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikita Vlasenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3815432/nikita-vlasenko"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8683,"user_id":2142055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae033a065a69861fc53c6a322db6414?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Goyo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2142055/goyo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569527823,"post_id":58123043,"comment_id":102636415,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123043/update-complex-dict-with-another-dict-with-different-formatting#comment102636415_58123043"},{"owner":{"reputation":8683,"user_id":2142055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae033a065a69861fc53c6a322db6414?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Goyo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2142055/goyo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569528016,"post_id":58123043,"comment_id":102636489,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123043/update-complex-dict-with-another-dict-with-different-formatting#comment102636489_58123043"},{"owner":{"reputation":8683,"user_id":2142055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ae033a065a69861fc53c6a322db6414?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Goyo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2142055/goyo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569528244,"post_id":58123043,"comment_id":102636580,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123043/update-complex-dict-with-another-dict-with-different-formatting#comment102636580_58123043"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1036,"user_id":3815432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3523270d3d2bdb908089a05957ccc711?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nikita Vlasenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3815432/nikita-vlasenko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569525683,"post_id":58123397,"comment_id":102635440,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123043/update-complex-dict-with-another-dict-with-different-formatting/58123397#comment102635440_58123397"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":321,"user_id":7238987,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/acf47133b3cef8963064bd5d3e90bdb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"algorythms","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7238987/algorythms"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569525505,"creation_date":1569525505,"answer_id":58123397,"question_id":58123043,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58123397","body_markdown":"You have &#39;None&#39;

I included example code below of how I used GroupShuffleSplit.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GroupShuffleSplit\r\n\r\ngss = GroupShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, train_size=0.8)\r\n\r\nfor train_indices, test_indices in gss.split(df, groups = df.Group_ID):\r\n    print(&#39;Train indices:&#39;, train_indices)\r\n    print(&#39;Test indices:&#39;, test_indices)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\n```\r\nTrain indices: [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\r\nTest indices: [2, 7, 9]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr in table form:\r\n\r\nTrain:\r\n```\r\n      Group_ID    Year\t Feature_x\r\n    0\t1\t      2011\t  163\r\n    1\t1\t      2012\t  173\r\n    3\t2\t      2011\t  25\r\n    4\t2\t      2012\t  53\r\n    5\t2\t      2013\t  78\r\n    6\t3\t      2011\t  82\r\n    8\t5\t      2011\t  60\r\n```\r\n\r\nTest:\r\n```\r\n      Group_ID    Year\t Feature_x\r\n    2\t1\t      2013\t  183\r\n    7\t4\t      2011\t  36\r\n    9\t5\t      2012\t  71\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are some groups which are contained in both the train and test set.\r\nI have checked that the datatype of Group_ID is consistent throughout the entire dataframe, so I&#39;m not really sure what is causing this issue.\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n_edit:_\r\n\r\nI used ```df.loc[train_indices]``` and ```df.loc[test_indices]``` to look at the values of the training and testing rows. In the train rows, all of the values which are supposed to be Ints are floats, and the test rows are normal.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrain_df = df.loc[train_indices]\r\ntest_df = df.loc[test_indices]\r\n\r\n\r\ntrain_df.head()\r\n\tYear\tGroup_ID\tFeature_x\r\n0\t2010.0\t14.0\t1.445161\r\n1\t2010.0\t15.0\t1.445161\r\n4\t2010.0\t18.0\t1.445161\r\n5\t2010.0\t20.0\t0.835484\r\n6\t2010.0\t21.0\t0.835484\r\n\r\n\r\ntest_df.head()\r\n\tYear\tGroup_ID\tFeature_x\r\n2\t2010\t16\t1.445161\r\n3\t2010\t17\t1.445161\r\n7\t2010\t25\t0.835484\r\n12\t2010\t33\t0.835484\r\n15\t2010\t37\t1.009677\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore using the ```info()``` method shows that these two have different column dtypes despite coming from the same dataframe.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrain_df.head().info()\r\n\r\n&lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt;\r\nInt64Index: 5 entries, 0 to 6\r\nData columns (total 4 columns):\r\nYear               5 non-null float64\r\nGroup_ID           5 non-null float64\r\nFeature_x          5 non-null float64\r\ndtypes: float64(3)\r\nmemory usage: 200.0 bytes\r\n\r\n\r\ntest_df.head().info()\r\n\r\n&lt;class &#39;pandas.core.frame.DataFrame&#39;&gt;\r\nInt64Index: 5 entries, 2 to 15\r\nData columns (total 4 columns):\r\nYear               5 non-null int64\r\nGroup_ID           5 non-null int64\r\nFeature_x          5 non-null float64\r\ndtypes: float64(1), int64(2)\r\nmemory usage: 200.0 bytes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, if I look at the ```df.dtypes()```, I see that the datatypes of the dataframe, are as I expect.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndf.dtypes()\r\n\r\nYear                 int64\r\nGroup_ID             int64\r\nFeature_x            float64\r\n                     ...   \r\nLength: 387, dtype: object\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also want to add that the input dataframe first came in with most of the columns being &#39;objects&#39; then I converted them to Ints and Floats. I don&#39;t think this should affect anything, but I might as well state this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123026/groupshufflesplit-in-scikit-learn-not-grouping-by-specified-groups-correctly","title":"GroupShuffleSplit in Scikit-learn not grouping by specified groups correctly"},{"tags":["java","algorithm","intervals"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2180,"user_id":1198979,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SdfGm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SSP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1198979/ssp"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569523978,"post_id":58123023,"comment_id":102634700,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123023/algorithm-to-check-if-overlapping-intervals-can-be-found-to-cover-a-bigger-int#comment102634700_58123023"},{"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":10941457,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/497ad4d2c9c001782fbc3eab3c593734?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zachary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10941457/zachary"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2180,"user_id":1198979,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SdfGm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SSP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1198979/ssp"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569525002,"post_id":58123023,"comment_id":102635139,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123023/algorithm-to-check-if-overlapping-intervals-can-be-found-to-cover-a-bigger-int#comment102635139_58123023"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":10941457,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/497ad4d2c9c001782fbc3eab3c593734?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zachary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10941457/zachary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569583202,"post_id":58131381,"comment_id":102653784,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123023/algorithm-to-check-if-overlapping-intervals-can-be-found-to-cover-a-bigger-int/58131381#comment102653784_58131381"},{"owner":{"reputation":40042,"user_id":5772882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/58mlb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ole V.V.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5772882/ole-v-v"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":122,"user_id":10941457,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/497ad4d2c9c001782fbc3eab3c593734?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zachary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10941457/zachary"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569599570,"post_id":58131381,"comment_id":102662164,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123023/algorithm-to-check-if-overlapping-intervals-can-be-found-to-cover-a-bigger-int/58131381#comment102662164_58131381"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":40042,"user_id":5772882,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/58mlb.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ole V.V.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5772882/ole-v-v"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569575428,"creation_date":1569575428,"answer_id":58131381,"question_id":58123023,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58131381","body_markdown":"Discard intervals that end before your start or start after your end.

The code below does that:\r\n\r\n```\r\nu = pd.DataFrame()\r\nu[&quot;step&quot;] = pd.Series([1,2,3,4,5,6])\r\nu[&quot;tx&quot;] = pd.Series([&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;])\r\nu[&quot;rx&quot;] = pd.Series([&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;C&quot;,&quot;A&quot;])\r\nu[&quot;A_to_B&quot;] = pd.Series([15,15,30,30,30,30])\r\nu[&quot;A_to_C&quot;] = pd.Series([0,20,20,40,50,50])\r\nu[&quot;B_to_A&quot;] = pd.Series([0,0,0,0,0,100])\r\n\r\nprint(u)\r\n\r\ndef compact(x):\r\n  rx = x[&quot;rx&quot;]\r\n  tx = x[&quot;tx&quot;]\r\n  x[&quot;combo&quot;] = x[tx + &quot;_to_&quot; + rx]\r\n  return x\r\n\r\nu = u.apply(lambda x: compact(x), axis=1)\r\n\r\nprint(u)\r\n```\r\nIt yields the following:\r\n```\r\n   step tx rx  A_to_B  A_to_C  B_to_A\r\n0     1  A  B      15       0       0\r\n1     2  A  C      15      20       0\r\n2     3  A  B      30      20       0\r\n3     4  A  C      30      40       0\r\n4     5  A  C      30      50       0\r\n5     6  B  A      30      50     100\r\n   step tx rx  A_to_B  A_to_C  B_to_A  combo\r\n0     1  A  B      15       0       0     15\r\n1     2  A  C      15      20       0     20\r\n2     3  A  B      30      20       0     30\r\n3     4  A  C      30      40       0     40\r\n4     5  A  C      30      50       0     50\r\n5     6  B  A      30      50     100    100\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that this is _very_ slow to run on a lot of rows.  Is there a more efficient/effective way to do this operation?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123016/pandas-combining-information-from-several-columns-where-value-depends-on-values","title":"Pandas combining information from several columns where value depends on values in the same row"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9818605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XnMp1fgyxbM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAE8w/tWGPqswXSYY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Raveendar V","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9818605/raveendar-v"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570005020,"creation_date":1570005020,"answer_id":58197924,"question_id":58123015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58197924","body_markdown":"Easy way is to create a list of properties of each div&#39;s and store it in the local storage or something and then retrieve it when the user reload the page.\r\n\r\nto store\r\n```\r\n   function addDraggableBox(\r\n\tcanvas_id = null,\r\n\tid,\r\n\tlength = null,\r\n\twidth = null,\r\n\tcomponentValue = null,\r\n\tclassificationData = null,\r\n\ttile_position = null\r\n) {\r\n\tlet component_value = componentValue || component.children(&#39;:selected&#39;).text(); // text to be shown for a component inside canvas\r\n\tlet bg_color = &#39;grey&#39;;\r\n\tlet txt_color = &#39;black&#39;;\r\n\tconst component_width = Number(width) || Number(wbox.val());\r\n\tconst component_length = Number(length) || Number(lbox.val());\r\n\r\n\tcomponent_value += ` (Area: ${component_width * component_length} sq.m)`; // add area to the component canvas text\r\n\r\n\tif (classificationData) {\r\n\t\tconst { bgColor, txtColor } = classificationData;\r\n\r\n\t\tbg_color = bgColor;\r\n\t\ttxt_color = txtColor || txt_color;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tvar $element = $(&#39;&lt;div class=&quot;draggablebox&quot; /&gt;&#39;).text(component_value).css({\r\n\t\twidth: component_width * zoom,\r\n\t\theight: component_length * zoom,\r\n\t\tpadding: &#39;0.5em&#39;,\r\n\t\t&#39;font-size&#39;: &#39;1em&#39;,\r\n\t\tborder: &#39;2px solid&#39;,\r\n\t\t&#39;user-select&#39;: &#39;none&#39;,\r\n\t\tbackground: bg_color,\r\n\t\tcolor: txt_color,\r\n\t\tcursor: &#39;pointer&#39;,\r\n\t\tposition: &#39;absolute&#39;,\r\n\t\tblock: &#39;inline&#39;,\r\n\t\ttop: tile_position ?

answer:** You can&#39;t do it website-only.\r\n\r\n**Longer answer / explanation:**\r\n\r\n&gt; I know there are options for Node.js,\r\n\r\nGood... that could work. Deploy your own Node.js server on Heroku or the like, which proxies requests to Firebase.\r\n\r\n&gt; but I&#39;m looking for a web browser solution. Firefox has this proxy settings, and Google Chrome also has some options for extension developers, but \r\n\r\nThis could work too, but as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve considered... that would rely on the end-users installing those extensions before attempting to visit your site.\r\n\r\n&gt; I need a solution that works just in a web page,\r\n\r\nNope. Not possible. The Google servers will not respond to any request coming from a sanctioned country. If a request comes from a disallowed country, the Firebase servers won&#39;t respond with your website - instead they respond with a 403. Firebase won&#39;t send the website. Your website won&#39;t be sent to the client. It doesn&#39;t matter what your website contains, it will never be sent to those end users in the first place.\r\n\r\nEven if you host the site elsewhere, and just use the Firebase database, it still won&#39;t work - for the same reasons. When the Firebase servers receive the request from a browser running in a sanctioned country, they respond with 403.\r\n\r\nThe question then becomes: How to make the request appear to come from outside the sanctioned country, from the website only?\r\n\r\nYou can&#39;t, not when you only control the website itself. That part of the request/response cycle is, for end-user protection purposes, handled by the browser. Browsers do not expose that functionality to webpages.\r\n\r\nIf you want to handle everything for your users, without them needing a VPN (*desktop, or browser*), your only choice will be to send the request to a different non-Google server (*such as a Node.js server you host on Heroku or the like*), which then makes the request to Firebase on their behalf, gets the response, and responds back to the client. That way, to the Firebase servers, it looks like the request is coming from X* location.\r\n\r\n*X: Where ever the Heroku server is running.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58123007/how-to-proxy-all-xmlhttprequest-in-a-web-browser/58124697#58124697","title":"How to proxy all XMLHttpRequest in a web browser?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3086,"user_id":3176270,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YbpSd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3176270/m98"},"last_editor":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58124697,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569531492,"creation_date":1569523684,"last_edit_date":1569524245,"question_id":58123007,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58123007","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Google Firebase, and unfortunately, Google Firebase put some countries under sanctions which means they must use a proxy (or VPN) to access the website.\r\n\r\nIs there any way I can set a proxy setting for each **client request** that they can freely access Firebase without a VPN?\r\n\r\nI know there are options for Node.js, but I&#39;m looking for a web browser solution.

I am using the `[Authorize]` attribute to do my most basic access authentication, really just to check to see if there is a user logged in at all. If not, then it kicks them back to the login page. Here&#39;s the services setup for that.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nservices.AddAuthentication(CookieAuthenticationDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)\r\n    .AddCookie(options =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        options.Cookie.Name = &quot;loginId&quot;;\r\n    });\r\nservices.ConfigureApplicationCookie(options =&gt; options.LoginPath = &quot;/Account/Logout&quot;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my Logout action.\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n\r\n[HttpGet]\r\n[AllowAnonymous]\r\npublic async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Logout(string returnUrl = &quot;/cgi-s/admin.cgi&quot;)\r\n{\r\n    await HttpContext.SignOutAsync();\r\n    if (HttpContext.Request.Cookies.TryGetValue(&quot;loginId&quot;, out string loginId))\r\n    {\r\n        User auth = _context.Users.Where(a =&gt; a.LoginId.Equals(loginId)).FirstOrDefault();\r\n        if (auth != null)\r\n        {\r\n            auth.LoginId = string.Empty;\r\n            await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    return Redirect(&quot;/Account/Login?returnUrl=&quot;+returnUrl);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I am just using the default behavior with a return url string to get back to the attempted page after a successful login. Is there a way to set this up so that POST data is also preserved?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a couple different things, like a custom middleware that stores post data which then gets retrieved on login, but I haven&#39;t come up with anything that I haven&#39;t found security holes in afterward.\r\n\r\nIs there an easy way to do this that I&#39;m just missing?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nPS. Please ignore the weirdness going on in the Logout action. We are a two man team working on a 20 year old Perl CGI site, slowly transitioning over to .NET while trying to also keep up with new features and bug fixes, so everything is weird while we run Perl CGI alongside some .NET code on IIS with Postgres. Hopefully we will eventually get everything transitioned over.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122995/asp-net-core-preserve-post-data-after-authorize-attribute-login-redirect","title":"ASP.NET Core - Preserve POST data after Authorize attribute login redirect"},{"tags":["r","finance","quantitative-finance","portfolio","r-portfolioanalytics"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11161918,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5144b5b85d80fbffdf896a2319cf2a58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GeorgiosStrat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11161918/georgiosstrat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569523622,"creation_date":1569523622,"question_id":58122994,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122994","body_markdown":"So, I am trying to pass the DCC garch forecasts to a portfolio to do further interesting stuff, such as computing the efficient frontier etc. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\ndcc.garch11.spec\r\ndcc.fit= dccfit(dcc.garch11.spec, data =Dat) \r\n\r\n#Forecasting \r\ndcc.fit.focast=dccforecast(dcc.fit, n.ahead = 1, n.roll = 0)\r\nprint(dcc.fit.focast)\r\n\r\n\r\nR_focast &lt;- dcc.fit.focast@mforecast$R \r\nH_focast&lt;-dcc.fit.focast@mforecast$H \r\n \r\n#Portfolio Optimization (Use the forecasted variance covariance matrix)\r\n\r\n#install.packages(&quot;timeSeries&quot;) need to make it timeSeries\r\nlibrary(timeSeries)\r\ntsDat&lt;-as.timeSeries(Dat) \r\n\r\n#install.packages(&quot;fPortfolio&quot;)\r\nlibrary(fPortfolio)\r\n\r\ncovtEstimator &lt;- function (x, data,spec) {x.mat = as.matrix(x) \r\nlist(mu = dcc.fit.focast@model$mu, Sigma = H_focast)}\r\n\r\ncovtSpec &lt;- portfolioSpec()\r\n\r\nsetEstimator(covtSpec) &lt;- &quot;covtEstimator&quot;\r\n\r\nsetNFrontierPoints(covtSpec) &lt;- 5\r\n\r\ncovtFrontier &lt;- portfolioFrontier(data = tsDat, spec = covtSpec)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError in dimnames(x) &lt;- dn : \r\n  length of &#39;dimnames&#39;

I use the Django Template Language in strings in the JSON files so each product has their own logic for creating product-specific ids. It works great with a Django Template Language callables.\r\n\r\nThe id_template has a callable to the to a model&#39;s method get_next_policy_id:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;model&quot;: &quot;some name&quot;,\r\n    &quot;product_id&quot;: &quot;some product name&quot;,\r\n    &quot;id_template&quot;: &quot;{{ policy.get_next_product_id }}&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the relevant code from the product model. You can see the method that provides the id, and the save method conditionally uses it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Policy():\r\n    [...]\r\n    def get_next_policy_id_risk_strategies(self):\r\n        policy_num = -1\r\n        sequence_name = self.product.product_id + &#39;-&#39; + self.source_application.form[&quot;state&quot;]\r\n        if self.source_application.form[&quot;state&quot;] == &quot;NY&quot;:\r\n            policy_num = get_next_value(sequence_name, initial_value=200_000)\r\n\r\n        elif self.source_application.form[&quot;state&quot;] == &quot;IA&quot;:\r\n            policy_num = get_next_value(sequence_name, initial_value=400_000)\r\n        else:\r\n            sequence_name = self.product.product_id\r\n            policy_num = get_next_value(sequence_name, initial_value=300_000)\r\n\r\n        policy_id = self.product.product_id + &quot;-&quot; + str(policy_num)\r\n        return policy_id\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThat works great. However, I&#39;d like to have no product-specific code in the model. I could do this almost entirely in the Django Template Language, but the requirements for the product id, is they vary by state sequentially. So, get_next_value draws from a persisted sequence in the database. Thus, I&#39;d like to move the conditional logic to the JSON file.\r\n\r\nHowever, callables take no parameters. And I need to pass the start of the sequence and the state as parameters to generate the id. Since tags can take parameters, I thought to use simple tags, which can take parameters. Along with template language conditionals. I thought I should be able to have a template string like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;id_template&quot;: &quot;{{ product.product_id }}-{% if product.source_application.form.state == \\&quot;NY\\&quot; %}{{ product.get_next_product_id &quot;NY&quot; 200000 }}{% elif product.source_application.form.state == \\&quot;IA\\&quot; %}{{ product.get_next_product_id &quot;IA&quot; 400000 }}{% else %}{{ product.get_next_product_id &quot;other&quot; 300000 }}{% endif %}&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in the model, I&#39;d place the following code:\r\n```\r\n    @register.simple_tag(name=&quot;get_next_product_id&quot;)\r\n    def get_next_product_id(self, state, initial_value):\r\n        sequence_name = self.product.product_id + &quot;-&quot; + self.source_application.form[&quot;state&quot;]\r\n        return get_next_value(sequence_name, initial_value=initial_value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I get an error from this:\r\n```\r\nE           django.template.exceptions.TemplateSyntaxError: Could not parse the remainder: &#39; &quot;NY&quot; 200000&#39; from &#39;get_next_product_id &quot;NY&quot; 200000&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought simple tags could have arguments. Is that mistaken? \r\n\r\nBecause the template string is not being parsed, I simplified the string to the following:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   &quot;id_template&quot;: &quot;{{ product.get_next_product_id &quot;NY&quot; 200000 }}&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut the error remains the same. Removing the quotes around &quot;NY&quot; has no effect.\r\n\r\nThe question is:\r\n\r\nIs what I am trying to do using Django Template Tags possible? And, if not, is there another way I should be moving the product-specific logic out of the model?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122950/can-django-template-tags-be-used-like-django-template-callables","title":"Can Django template tags be used like Django Template callables?"},{"tags":["c#","entity-framework"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":189230,"user_id":1197518,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cjKiP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steve","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1197518/steve"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569523499,"post_id":58122947,"comment_id":102634510,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list#comment102634510_58122947"},{"owner":{"reputation":28336,"user_id":74015,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b7088749adc3ec3e51982d0a3bf1b34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sam Axe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/74015/sam-axe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523506,"post_id":58122947,"comment_id":102634513,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list#comment102634513_58122947"},{"owner":{"reputation":756,"user_id":1390272,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LS4tU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Goku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1390272/goku"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569524117,"post_id":58122947,"comment_id":102634756,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list#comment102634756_58122947"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6617849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7a2e4edca871b6be7263004fdc91039?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kifka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6617849/kifka"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569568135,"post_id":58122947,"comment_id":102646182,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list#comment102646182_58122947"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6617849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7a2e4edca871b6be7263004fdc91039?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kifka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6617849/kifka"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569568063,"post_id":58125131,"comment_id":102646151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list/58125131#comment102646151_58125131"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9078,"user_id":423497,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95c411e966f549fa07b3d7fb142ba733?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve Py","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/423497/steve-py"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569534174,"creation_date":1569534174,"answer_id":58125131,"question_id":58122947,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58125131","body_markdown":"To expand on Steve&#39;s comment, the issue likely isn&#39;t with EF or adding the items to the DbSet, but rather with how you populate the entity list to save.\r\n\r\nTake this for example:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;ProductImage&gt; productImages = new List&lt;ProductImage&gt;();\r\n    Product product = context.Products.Single(x =&gt; x.ProductId == productId);\r\n    ProductImage productImage = new ProductImage();\r\n    for (int count = 1; count &lt; 5; count++)\r\n    {\r\n       productImage.ImageNumber = count;\r\n       productImage.Product = product;\r\n       productImages.Add(productImage);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ...\r\n    context.ProductImages.AddRange(productImages);\r\n\r\nThe issue with the above code is that the loop is merely updating the same single reference of a ProductImage object. The list will contain 5 references to the same image and that image&#39;s Number will be &quot;5&quot;. \r\n\r\nInstead:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;ProductImage&gt; productImages = new List&lt;ProductImage&gt;();\r\n    Product product = context.Products.Single(x =&gt; x.ProductId == productId);\r\n    for (int count = 1; count &lt; 5; count++)\r\n    {\r\n       ProductImage productImage = new ProductImage();\r\n       productImage.ImageNumber = count;\r\n       productImage.Product = product;\r\n       productImages.Add(productImage);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ...\r\n    context.ProductImages.AddRange(productImages);\r\n\r\nBy moving the constructor for ProductImage into the loop, each image is a separate reference resulting in 5 unique items in the collection. \r\n\r\nThe important detail is that if all of the images are for the same product, that you *do* use a single product reference for all images. Whether that product is loaded from the database (above) or created as a new item. A common pitfall that developers new to EF make would be:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;ProductImage&gt; productImages = new List&lt;ProductImage&gt;();\r\n    for (int count = 1; count &lt; 5; count++)\r\n    {\r\n       Product product = new Product { ProductId = productId };\r\n       ProductImage productImage = new ProductImage();\r\n       productImage.ImageNumber = count;\r\n       productImage.Product = product;\r\n       productImages.Add(productImage);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ...\r\n    context.ProductImages.AddRange(productImages);\r\n\r\nWhere they may have an existing Product ID that the user has selected, and don&#39;t want to hit the database to load it, so they just create a Product entity and set the ID thinking all will be good. The issue here is that each Product instance will be a separate instance, and when you add the ProductImage to the DbSet, all untracked entities associated with that product image (Product in this case) will be treated as &quot;Adds&quot; as well. The result is that 5 new identical Products (with new IDs) would be added to the database provided the Product ID PK was configured as an Identity, or you&#39;d get an error about inserting duplicate IDs.  With EF it is important to work with unique instances where you want unique records created, and work with a single instance (loaded from the DB, created new, or created as a stub and attached to the context) where you want to reference a single existing or new row.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122947/why-does-entity-framework-saves-only-the-last-item-of-a-list/58125131#58125131","title":"why does entity framework saves only the last item of a list?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6617849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d7a2e4edca871b6be7263004fdc91039?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kifka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6617849/kifka"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569764298,"creation_date":1569764298,"answer_id":58155769,"question_id":58122947,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58155769","body_markdown":"after banging my head against the wall for a few days - i finally got the solution.\r\n\r\nthe problem was in my ProductImage Entity which looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   public class ProductImage : ImageProp, DBEntity\r\n    {\r\n        [Column(&quot;Name&quot;, TypeName = &quot;nvarchar(200)&quot;), Required, Display(Name = &quot;שם&quot;), MaxLength(200)]\r\n        public string Name { get;

Any ideas?\r\n\r\n    codepen.io/brandoniscool/pen/vYBMZyM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122944/how-can-i-link-button-onclick-to-slide-to-the-next-panel-horizontally","title":"How can I link button onclick to slide to the next panel horizontally"},{"tags":["pycharm","install","kivy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":214,"user_id":9211949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RUZ1B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CoderCharmander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9211949/codercharmander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569523605,"post_id":58122935,"comment_id":102634554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122935/trouble-installing-kivy-on-pycharm#comment102634554_58122935"},{"owner":{"reputation":5951,"user_id":7254633,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-XCPaMN6qzA0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADs/o9igiVGFyK0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John Anderson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7254633/john-anderson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569624008,"post_id":58122935,"comment_id":102670073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122935/trouble-installing-kivy-on-pycharm#comment102670073_58122935"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12015973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-me2T959grvA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWYlp2OPjSz56Rwi1xrugizX97fg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Leyla ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015973/leyla"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569754209,"post_id":58122935,"comment_id":102691988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122935/trouble-installing-kivy-on-pycharm#comment102691988_58122935"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12015973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-me2T959grvA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWYlp2OPjSz56Rwi1xrugizX97fg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Leyla ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12015973/leyla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2110,"user_id":9206753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156572780228840/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jee Mok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9206753/jee-mok"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569546522,"creation_date":1569523298,"last_edit_date":1569546522,"question_id":58122935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122935","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t install Kivy on pycharm, it doesn&#39;t seem to recognize it\r\n\r\nI followed the instructions on the kivy website for the installation, which was completed.\r\n\r\nI tried to get Kivy to work on pyCharm: I followed these instructions: https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/Setting-Up-Kivy-with-various-popular-IDE&#39;s\r\nI only have the basic python interpreter to choose from, but I also tried to install the Kivy package, which didn&#39;t seem to make a difference (File &gt; Settings &gt; Project &gt; Project Interpreter &gt; +(Available packages) and selected Kivy)\r\n\r\nI tried following different online tutorials, which all seemed pretty similar one to the other, but my problem persists.\r\n\r\nThis is the shown message: \r\n\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;C:/Users/ivost/PycharmProjects/Kivy/Kivy try.py&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n        import kivy\r\n    ModuleNotFoundError: No module named &#39;kivy&#39;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58122935/trouble-installing-kivy-on-pycharm","title":"Trouble installing Kivy on pyCharm"},{"tags":["eclipse","svn"],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":1927269,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/556b6a373c871f0841b07132e59b216b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank Wittich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1927269/frank-wittich"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569523294,"creation_date":1569523294,"question_id":58122933,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58122933","body_markdown":"I have an application, that consists of multiple projects, basically a bunch of libraries and one project that brings it all together.
