You can create a dataframe by\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    df = pd.read_csv(&#39;house_price.csv&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis gives you a dataframe of 13581 rows and 21 columns, each with its own data type.

It is basically a conversion to `&amp;&amp;T` (the explicit conversion is covered below) and is used in order to ultimately force the use of overloaded move constructor and assignment which take care of the *actual moving*.\r\n\r\nMy question here is: is this the only use case for `std::move`? Also, why would I declare something as `int &amp;&amp;a = std::move(42);`?\r\n\r\n&gt; `a[n]`, the built-in subscript expression, where one operand is an array rvalue\r\n\r\nOk, here I&#39;m totally lost: what is an *array rvalue* and what is the difference between that and an *array lvalue* (mentioned above in the lvalues examples)?\r\n\r\nI guess that the wording of *one operand* refers to this C/C++ syntactic weirdness: `a[n] == n[a]`.\r\n\r\n &gt; `a.m`, the member of object expression, where `a` is an rvalue and `m` is a non-static data member of non-reference type\r\n\r\nSo, if `a` is an expression that happens to be an rvalue, then `a.m` is an xvalue provided that `m` satisfies some conditions.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    struct A { int m = 0; };\r\n    A a() { return A{}; }\r\n\r\nThen `a().m` is an xvalue. Is that correct?\r\n&gt; `a.*mp`, the pointer to member of object expression, where a is an rvalue and mp is a pointer to data member\r\n\r\nThis is possibly the same as the previous example, except using the &quot;pointer to member&quot; feature. Is that correct?\r\n\r\n&gt; `a ? b : c`, the ternary conditional expression for some `b` and `c`\r\n\r\n*Edited*\r\n\r\nThis one I find interesting: why is it not of the same type of category as either `b` or `c`?\r\n\r\n&gt; a cast expression to rvalue reference to object type, such as `static_cast&lt;char&amp;&amp;&gt;(x)`\r\n\r\nSame as with `std::move`. Also, why is `std::move` defined to use `static_cast` and not `dynamic_cast`?\r\n\r\n&gt; any expression that designates a temporary object, after temporary materialization. (since C++17)\r\n\r\nWhich flavor of *temporary materialization* (I know the one about const ref initialization)? Any example for this?\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/value_category\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227946/c-undertanding-examples-of-xvalues","title":"C++ - undertanding examples of xvalues"},{"tags":["ruby","geokit","sorbet"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":1015863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/82j8j.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1015863/jez"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570144503,"creation_date":1570144503,"answer_id":58228025,"question_id":58227944,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58228025","body_markdown":"You are missing `self.` in the RBI definition of that method.

have to understand how python path works. This is a list of directories where python looks for the modules you try to import, you can display it uing the `sys.path` command.

It would be best to explicitly specify the `charset`, e.g. using content type `text/csv; charset=UTF-8`, so the client knows the character set used by the server.\r\n\r\nSince you specified a content type of `text/csv`, but with a body type of `byte[]`, Spring is using some other [`HttpMessageConverter`][5], probably a [`ObjectToStringHttpMessageConverter`][6], with a [`ConversionService`][7] that encodes `byte[]` to `String` as Base-64.\r\n\r\nSide note: For better performance, don&#39;t auto-flush each line of output. Turn auto-flush off and just do a final `flush()` when done.\r\n\r\nLong story short, since you want text, don&#39;t convert to `byte[]`. Use a [`StringWriter`][8] to keep everything as text:\r\n\r\n\t@PostMapping(path = BASE_ROUTE + &quot;/download&quot;, produces = &quot;text/csv; charset=UTF-8&quot;)\r\n\tpublic ResponseEntity&lt;String&gt; downloadCases(@RequestBody RequestType request) throws IOException {\r\n\t\ttry (StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();\r\n\t\t\t\tPrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(stringWriter)) {\r\n\t\t\tString nextPageToken = null;\r\n\t\t\tdo {\r\n\t\t\t\tServiceResponse serviceResponse = makeServiceCall(request.getParam());\r\n\t\t\t\t// write a String of comma separated values\r\n\t\t\t\twriter.println(serviceResponse.getLine());\r\n\t\t\t\t// eventually null\r\n\t\t\t\tnextPageToken = serviceResponse.getToken();\r\n\t\t\t} while (nextPageToken != null);\r\n\t\t\twriter.flush();\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\treturn ResponseEntity.ok()\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, &quot;text/csv; charset=UTF-8&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_DISPOSITION, &quot;attachment; filename=\\&quot;report.csv\\&quot;&quot;)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.body(stringWriter.toString());\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nSince you never used the `response` parameter, it was removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/web.html#mvc-ann-responseentity\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#rest-message-conversion\r\n  [3]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/StringHttpMessageConverter.html\r\n  [5]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/HttpMessageConverter.html\r\n  [6]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/http/converter/ObjectToStringHttpMessageConverter.html\r\n  [7]: https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/ConversionService.html\r\n  [8]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/StringWriter.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227921/create-a-csv-and-return-as-byte-for-download-in-a-spring-controller/58278653#58278653","title":"Create a CSV and return as byte[] for download in a Spring Controller"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10327093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d93R8znae2w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABTYQ/RuylJcIeb0Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"TwoPerfect","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10327093/twoperfect"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10327093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-d93R8znae2w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABTYQ/RuylJcIeb0Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"TwoPerfect","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10327093/twoperfect"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570493948,"creation_date":1570143641,"last_edit_date":1570233468,"question_id":58227921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227921","body_markdown":"Summary: `ResponseEntity&lt;byte[]&gt;` containing CSV is not returned as CSV\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI&#39;m writing a controller for a download button that will generate a CSV with data retrieved from another dependency.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @PostMapping(BASE_ROUTE + &quot;/download&quot;)\r\n    public ResponseEntity&lt;byte[]&gt; downloadCases(@RequestBody RequestType request, final HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException {\r\n        try (ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream();\r\n                OutputStreamWriter outputStreamWriter = new OutputStreamWriter(outputStream, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);\r\n                PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(outputStreamWriter, true)) {\r\n            String nextPageToken = null;\r\n            do {\r\n                ServiceResponse serviceResponse = makeServiceCall(request.getParam());\r\n                // write a String of comma separated values\r\n                writer.println(serviceResponse.getLine());\r\n                // eventually null\r\n                nextPageToken = serviceResponse.getToken(); \r\n            } while (nextPageToken != null);\r\n\r\n            return ResponseEntity.ok()\r\n                    .header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_TYPE, &quot;text/csv&quot;)\r\n                    .header(HttpHeaders.CONTENT_DISPOSITION, &quot;attachment; filename=\\&quot;report.csv\\&quot;&quot;)\r\n                    .body(outputStream.toByteArray());\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a test, I also tried setting the body to `.body(&quot;Case ID,Assignee&quot;.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8))`.

You can make an invalid syscall in your assembly code. Your program will happily continue execution but `lldb` will break on the **next instruction** after the syscall with `SIGSYS`/`EXC_SYSCALL`. You haven&#39;t specified if you&#39;re targetting x86-64 or arm so the setup will differ slightly.\r\n\r\nFor **x86-64** you&#39;d have\r\n\r\n    syscall\r\nAssuming your `rax` register does not happen to be a valid syscall i.e in `0x2000xxx` range the destructive part will include:\r\n\r\n1) Zeroing upper 32bits of `rax` register\r\n\r\n2) `r11` will become `rflags`\r\n\r\n3) `rcx` will become `rip` (it&#39;s used by the XNU kernel for returning to the user space from the `syscall`), *however* if you single step `rcx` will become `rsp` as mentioned by me [here][1] \r\n\r\nFor **32 bit** and **64bit arm**  you can make a system call with:\r\n\r\n    svc 0x80 \r\nBtw any 1 byte^ number will work, but by convention it&#39;s `0x80`.\r\n32bit uses `r12` for syscall number. 64bit uses `x16`. More info [here][2] &amp; [here][3]. So basically valid ranges are `0x0` - `0x0xxx`. Even invalid syscalls seem to affect `x0` &amp; `x1` (for 64bit, as I don&#39;t have a 32bit device to test). So as long as you take into account `x0` &amp; `x1` being affected after the syscall and happen to have `x16` that does happen to be a valid syscall you&#39;re good to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57523462/lldb-affecting-rcx-value-upon-exc-syscall\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/56993314/5329717\r\n  [3]: https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Kernel_Syscalls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227906/how-to-set-a-breakpoint-on-an-assembly-file-using-xcode/58233495#58233495","title":"How to set a breakpoint on an assembly file using Xcode?"}],"owner":{"reputation":800,"user_id":4821710,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e71896fe8c180bb8e96ae6ddbefbc903?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joshua Leung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4821710/joshua-leung"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23205,"user_id":1033581,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8891617e36b8d1254eb3ce1a5662da4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cœur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1033581/c%c5%93ur"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570520042,"creation_date":1570143532,"last_edit_date":1570520042,"question_id":58227906,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227906","body_markdown":"I tried &quot;breakpoint [line number]&quot;, &quot;breakpoint filename.s:line_number&quot; but they don&#39;t work.

The `m_hiddenLayers` needs to be initialised with the first element referencing the input layer and the rest using the previous item in the `std::tuple`, and they also need to be created with the correct type, i.e. `Neuron` instead of `NeuronBase`.\r\n\r\nHow can I accomplish this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227885/how-to-initialise-a-variadic-template-that-relies-on-previous-entries","title":"How to initialise a variadic template that relies on previous entries?"},{"tags":["c","postgresql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":3424746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e09ba41aee19d01cf5070f7f5e47a3ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PiRocks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3424746/pirocks"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143485,"post_id":58227882,"comment_id":102830571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227882/problems-with-appendstringinfo#comment102830571_58227882"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12076752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sKrsAONmNb4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4RYQHLlWuUHmg8E7ANArOME6J5A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yessica Brinkmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076752/yessica-brinkmann"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":307,"user_id":3424746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e09ba41aee19d01cf5070f7f5e47a3ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PiRocks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3424746/pirocks"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570148867,"post_id":58227882,"comment_id":102831640,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227882/problems-with-appendstringinfo#comment102831640_58227882"},{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":307,"user_id":3424746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e09ba41aee19d01cf5070f7f5e47a3ba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PiRocks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3424746/pirocks"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570168478,"post_id":58227882,"comment_id":102835357,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227882/problems-with-appendstringinfo#comment102835357_58227882"},{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570168934,"post_id":58227882,"comment_id":102835484,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227882/problems-with-appendstringinfo#comment102835484_58227882"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12076752,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sKrsAONmNb4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4RYQHLlWuUHmg8E7ANArOME6J5A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yessica Brinkmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076752/yessica-brinkmann"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570168672,"creation_date":1570143388,"last_edit_date":1570168672,"question_id":58227882,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227882","body_markdown":"I have a function called `get_columnames` that returns the names of the columns of a table, by passing the attribute numbers.\r\n\r\nI really thought a lot about why it would be but I still don&#39;t understand why I am wrong in the expression\r\n\r\n    appendStringInfo (&amp; cols, &quot;% s a.attnum =% d&quot;, (i&gt; 0? &quot;OR&quot;: &quot;&quot;), idxcd-&gt; varattno [i]);\r\n\r\nThe error appears only to me when entering the cycle\r\n\r\n    foreach (cell, candidates) / * foreach cell in candidates * /\r\n\r\nmore than once, that is when there is more than one candidate index.\r\nIf the cycle is entered only once, the function works correctly.\r\n\r\nThe error that I get is that the connection to the PostgreSQL server is directly lost.

You only get the risk of mismatches and messed up directories.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/ADFNS/adfns_odbc.htm#ADFNS1183\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/odbc/microsoft/connection-string-format-and-attributes?redirectedfrom=MSDN&amp;view=sql-server-2017","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227872/is-it-possible-to-have-a-32-bit-odbc-connection-on-windows-10-without-a-tnsnames/58231126#58231126","title":"Is it possible to have a 32 bit ODBC connection on Windows 10 without a tnsnames.ora file?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7273200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4acdbffa3fb50fc19a387a9a4e7366a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zlinedavid89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7273200/zlinedavid89"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7273200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4acdbffa3fb50fc19a387a9a4e7366a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"zlinedavid89","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7273200/zlinedavid89"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570457024,"creation_date":1570143319,"last_edit_date":1570457024,"question_id":58227872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227872","body_markdown":"I have a VBA (Excel) macro that connects to and queries an Oracle database.  Running under Windows 7, the following connection string works: \r\n\r\n    Driver={Microsoft ODBC for Oracle}; Server=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)(PORT=xxx))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=name))); Uid=username;Pwd=password;\r\n\r\n\r\nI and the rest of the users of this Excel template are being transitioned to Windows 10 (64 bit), with 32 bit Office 365.  What I like about this connection string is that it doesn&#39;t require a separate tnsnames.ora file, a feature I&#39;d like to keep.  I also know that the Microsoft drivers are being deprecated (and it doesn&#39;t work out of the box anyway), so the time to change it is now.  \r\n\r\nI have the following installed: \r\n\r\n - Oracle Instant Client 12.2 (32 bit)\r\n - Oracle ODBC Drivers for Instant Client 12.2 (32 bit)\r\n - Visual Studio 2019 (32 bit)(assuming the Oracle drivers are forward-compatible)\r\n\r\nI have verified that: \r\n\r\n - the first value in PATH is set to the directory where Instant Client 12.2 is installed\r\n - ORACLE_HOME is set to the same directory\r\n - there is only one ORACLE_HOME variable\r\n - The driver (Oracle in instantclient_12_2) is visible in the 32 bit ODBC admin tool\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried various tweaks of the following connection string, with no luck\r\n\r\n    Driver={Oracle in instantclient_12_2}; Server=(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)(PORT=xxx))(CONNECT_DATA=(SID=name))); Uid=username;Pwd=password\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using &quot;Data Source&quot; in place of &quot;Server&quot;, &quot;SERVICE_NAME&quot; in place of &quot;SID&quot;, and both at the same time.  I&#39;ve also tried the string in Excel 365&#39;s internal ODBC connection.  The error I keep receiving is: \r\n\r\n&gt; ORA-12560: TNS:protocol adapter error\r\n\r\nI&#39;m starting to get the suspicion that a tnsname.ora file is necessary under Windows 10. Is it possible to create a Windows 10 32 bit OBDC connection without using a tnsnames.ora file or any other actions aside from installing the Oracle drivers on a user&#39;s machine? \r\n\r\nEdit: I created a remotely accessible tnsnames file.  When the connection string uses that file and the TNS_ADMIN environment variable is set, it connects.  If I use the exact text from the tnsnames file in VBA itself, it does not recognize it (TNS Adapter Error).  I&#39;m going to assume that my suspicion about the Oracle drivers requiring a tnsnames.ora file is true, at least for VBA.

I&#39;m exploring the possibility of using Access as a\r\n&gt; simple front end for office work but want it to jive with our larger data operation. I&#39;ve designed a *Main Form* with\r\n&gt; `Edit`, `Cancel`, `Save`, and `Refresh` buttons.  In the body of that\r\n&gt; form I&#39;ve embedded a *Sub-form* containing a **datasheet**.  My `Edit`\r\n&gt; button unlocks the sheet in the *Sub-form* for insert and delete.  This\r\n&gt; *Sub-form* is bound to a local access table which serves as a cash. \r\n&gt; The `Refresh` button rebases my Access table/cache with the OLTP server and\r\n&gt; the `Save` button writes any records in my Access table/cache marked\r\n&gt; as `[Accepted]=No` to the OLTP server and then refreshes.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how I could better get CRUD working with OLTP and Access are appreciated as that is the full goal here.  However, I think I&#39;m close on my own if I can figure out how to intercept or get the record ID of updated rows.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227857/ms-access-get-row-id-of-update-or-intercept-update","title":"MS Access get row ID of Update or intercept Update"},{"tags":["python","performance","dictionary","iteration"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143341,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830543,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830543_58227855"},{"owner":{"reputation":3244,"user_id":10824407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32862a03314e434224acf280c38e6e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Olvin Roght","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10824407/olvin-roght"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143371,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830546,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830546_58227855"},{"owner":{"reputation":1924,"user_id":3808877,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jWfYi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jobs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3808877/jobs"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":39020,"user_id":1011724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2JAXi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011724/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143385,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830553,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830553_58227855"},{"owner":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3244,"user_id":10824407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32862a03314e434224acf280c38e6e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Olvin Roght","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10824407/olvin-roght"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143455,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830566,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830566_58227855"},{"owner":{"reputation":3244,"user_id":10824407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32862a03314e434224acf280c38e6e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Olvin Roght","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10824407/olvin-roght"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570143511,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830579,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830579_58227855"},{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570143673,"post_id":58227855,"comment_id":102830618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227855/best-way-performance-wise-to-iterate-over-a-dictionary#comment102830618_58227855"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"last_editor":{"reputation":74786,"user_id":364696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7eBCp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ShadowRanger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/364696/shadowranger"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570144095,"last_edit_date":1570144095,"creation_date":1570143613,"answer_id":58227919,"question_id":58227855,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227919","body_markdown":"If you need both keys and values, use `for k, v in mydict.items():`; iterating the keys and then looking it up means unnecessarily looking up information you could have gotten for free with `.items()`.

The content is embedded in the table in order to make it scrollable. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried [piggybacking][2] onto existing elements that can pop out over the table, but couldn&#39;t get the `:before` and `:after` semantics right. I&#39;ve also tried changing the z-index of the tooptip (and all of the other elements) but this didn&#39;t produce any noticeable effect. So, instead, I wrote a javascript solution to wrap the elements in question with a `div` that causes a tooltip to pop up when they&#39;re hovered over instead. Looks like this is running fine; now I just need the tooltip it creates to appear outside its parent container.\r\n\r\nCan I get the tooltip to escape like the alt text? Alternatively, can I style the alt text?\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    //set fields to readonly, and then inject hovertext\r\n    function doHoverText() {\r\n      setReadOnly(&quot;textarea&quot;);\r\n      setReadOnly(&quot;input&quot;);\r\n      injectHoverText(&quot;textarea&quot;);\r\n      injectHoverText(&quot;input&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    //set all textarea and input fields to readonly\r\n    function setReadOnly(elem_type) {\r\n      var areas = document.getElementsByTagName(elem_type);\r\n      for (var i = 0;

Someone said that if privoxy accept &#39;CONNNECT&#39; then everything should be fine, but in my case clearly is not. As i understande privoxy accepts connects by default, unless i specify in config. Or maybe i made my nginx config wrong? Also, the gifs and animation do not work, they getting loaded but do not work. So i add up to this post, can i serve images from clearnet with nginx to interrupt loading them from my onion service? Having all that, i have to say, that from tor network - if i load my onion site in tor browser, everything works fine, websockets are connected, animation works etc..\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227832/routing-websocket-into-tor-network-with-meteor-web-application-in-it","title":"Routing websocket into tor network with Meteor web application in it"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css","reactjs"],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11731229,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3S43Ys7F1FU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAn4/OD5ppp1BDdM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daniel Williams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11731229/daniel-williams"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11731229,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-3S43Ys7F1FU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAn4/OD5ppp1BDdM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daniel Williams","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11731229/daniel-williams"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570143866,"creation_date":1570143016,"last_edit_date":1570143866,"question_id":58227830,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227830","body_markdown":"I have a family tree I&#39;m constructing, and for some reason it can only maintain the desired structure under certain(large [13000 x 3000]) height/width dimensions, yielding way too much white space on the rest of the page.

company produces a Java application that we ship to customers. (It&#39;s not a hosted application.) The customer is able to modify the `logback.xml` file to adjust the logging levels of the application code and of various libraries that the application uses.\r\n\r\nWe want to preserve this ability, but with one restriction. We want to make it so that the customer is unable to set the log level for `org.hibernate` (and for the many packages that are children/descendants of `org.hibernate`) to `debug`. This is because we need to ensure that PII (personally-identifiable information) is not logged, and hibernate&#39;s debug-level logging would cause PII to be logged.\r\n\r\nThere are 100s of classes in the application that create Logger objects, and it would not be feasible to modify every one of those Loggers individually. Is there a way, using Java code in the application, to set the log level of `org.hibernate` (and its sub-packages) to `info` at the application level?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227799/java-code-to-override-hibernate-logging-level-from-logback-xml","title":"Java code to override hibernate logging level from logback.xml"},{"tags":["swift","kotlin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1150,"user_id":287761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/97b082da2e737a0d1c74e629f4f81b3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Enselic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/287761/enselic"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570161303,"post_id":58227797,"comment_id":102833806,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227797/is-there-a-way-in-kotlin-for-an-interface-to-have-an-associated-type-contract#comment102833806_58227797"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12128641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3de4d7acc4ab50f3a151173cd53f0a6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SwiftyKotlin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12128641/swiftykotlin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570209159,"post_id":58234302,"comment_id":102853618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227797/is-there-a-way-in-kotlin-for-an-interface-to-have-an-associated-type-contract/58234302#comment102853618_58234302"},{"owner":{"reputation":518,"user_id":6121671,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEYZX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GV_FiQst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6121671/gv-fiqst"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12128641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3de4d7acc4ab50f3a151173cd53f0a6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SwiftyKotlin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12128641/swiftykotlin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570278491,"post_id":58234302,"comment_id":102867373,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227797/is-there-a-way-in-kotlin-for-an-interface-to-have-an-associated-type-contract/58234302#comment102867373_58234302"},{"owner":{"reputation":518,"user_id":6121671,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEYZX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GV_FiQst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6121671/gv-fiqst"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12128641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3de4d7acc4ab50f3a151173cd53f0a6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SwiftyKotlin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12128641/swiftykotlin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571240605,"post_id":58234302,"comment_id":103177018,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227797/is-there-a-way-in-kotlin-for-an-interface-to-have-an-associated-type-contract/58234302#comment103177018_58234302"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":518,"user_id":6121671,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEYZX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GV_FiQst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6121671/gv-fiqst"},"last_editor":{"reputation":518,"user_id":6121671,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oEYZX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GV_FiQst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6121671/gv-fiqst"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571300847,"last_edit_date":1571300847,"creation_date":1570183788,"answer_id":58234302,"question_id":58227797,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58234302","body_markdown":"In Kotlin (as well as in Java) enums are defined at compile time as singletons. That&#39;s why you can&#39;t use variables on them. Only predefined static values.\r\n\r\nIn you have this enum\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nenum class MyEnum(val text: String) {\r\n    MyValue(&quot;some text&quot;)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you call it\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval myEnum = MyEnum.MyValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach time you will have the same object.\r\n\r\nAll enums that are declared inside other classes are [static][1] ([here is the question on stackoverflow][2] about static keyword), which means they don&#39;t depend on objects at runtime but on classes at compile time.\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\ndata class MyClass {\r\n   enum class MyEnum {\r\n       ...\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill compile to:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyClass {\r\n\r\n   public static enum MyEnum {\r\n      ...\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is why you can&#39;t use [inner][3] modifier on them:\r\n\r\n[![inner enum class is not allowed][4]][4]\r\n\r\nTo achieve your desired result you have two options:\r\n\r\n1) Use properties:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\ninterface Constants {\r\n   val text: String\r\n}\r\n\r\n// data classes are final and cannot be extended later\r\ndata class ViewState(val viewName: String) : Constants {\r\n    override val text = &quot;some view text&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndata class LayerState(val layerName: String) : Constants {\r\n    override val text = &quot;some layer text&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2) Define two different enums (without interface):\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\ndata class ViewState(val viewName: String) {\r\n    enum class StringProperties(val string: String) {\r\n        Text(&quot;some view text&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndata class LayerState(val layerName: String) {\r\n    enum class StringProperties(val string: String) {\r\n        Text(&quot;some layer text&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis way you can use it &quot;as is&quot; but without your `Constants` interface\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nval viewText = ViewState.StringProperties.Text.string // &quot;some view text&quot;\r\nval layerText = LayerState.StringProperties.Text.string // &quot;some layer text&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nKotlin supports [extensions][5] but it doesn&#39;t modify your class. Instead new method with your object as argument is created:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\nfun MyObject.extensionFunc() {\r\n   // do stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill compile to\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void extensionFunc(MyObject $receiver) {\r\n    // do stuff\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Edit 2:**\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon your question again, thought it through again, and I think I have a solution for you: how `Adapter` and `ViewHolder` are tied together in `RecyclerView` android lib.\r\n\r\n```\r\ninterface Adapter&lt;T : Adapter.ViewHolder&gt; {\r\n\r\n    fun doSmth(viewHolder: T)\r\n\r\n    interface ViewHolder\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever you want to implement `Adapter` you must also implement `ViewHolder`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass AdapterImpl : Adapter&lt;AdapterImpl.MyViewHolder&gt; {\r\n\r\n    override fun doSmth(viewHolder: MyViewHolder) {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    class MyViewHolder : Adapter.ViewHolder {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope this is what you&#39;re been looking for!\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Other events that are sent the same way do not disappear. We&#39;ve tried resending the disappearing events, and those events end up disappearing again at around 1 day. Any insight as to what might be causing this would be greatly appreciated because my next stop might be the loony bin.\r\n\r\nAt first we thought the events weren&#39;t actually getting to Analytics, so we built out improvements to track the response status of each request we make. After we discovered that it wasn&#39;t a problem with the events reaching Analytics we investigated whether or not there were filters in place that were blocking the events. That was not the case. We got access to certain client accounts and watched as the events came in Real Time events and then appeared in Events Overview. \r\n\r\nOnce we confirmed that the events were in fact getting to Analytics, we resent ones that we thought didn&#39;t make it since they weren&#39;t in Analytics. Those resent events appeared in both Real Time events and Events Overview. A day later we discovered that the events were no longer there. \r\n\r\nWe have unsuccessfully tried to find the difference between the events that stick and the events that disappear. We even thought that maybe there were gclid errors and when the gclids were sent over to AdWords from Analytics something would error and then Analytics would remove the events associated to the gclid. We have since sent the gclids as conversions straight to AdWords without any issues.\r\n\r\nHere are two GET requests that we have made to the same Analytics account that have produced one event that stuck and one that disappeared.\r\n\r\nEvent sent on 09/09/19 still in Analytics:\r\n```\r\nhttps://www.google-analytics.com/collect?v=1&amp;t=event&amp;tid={account_id}&amp;cid=6EFD2E9B-648D-4142-9500-9CBEECFC31F8&amp;ec=call&amp;ea=Google+-+Paid&amp;el=&amp;ev=33&amp;aip=1&amp;geoid=AU&amp;cn=&amp;cs=Google+-+Paid&amp;cm=cpc&amp;ck=&amp;sn=&amp;ua=Mozilla%2F5.0+%28Windows+NT+10.0%3B+Win64%3B+x64%29+AppleWebKit%2F537.36+%28KHTML%2C+like+Gecko%29+Chrome%2F76.0.3809.132+Safari%2F537.36&amp;dr=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;gclid={gclid}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvent

about creating the dictionary before adding new items to the list?\r\n\r\nNo?\r\n\r\nOK, let&#39;s try another one.\r\n\r\nA solution for this problem is to use the **Tag** property of the **ListViewItem** to separate and identify the new and old items. For example, when you add new items to the ListView, assign the value &quot;1&quot; to the Tag property:\r\n\r\n    ListViewItem item = new ListViewItem(Path.GetFileName(entry.Key));\r\n    item.SubItems.Add(entry.Value);\r\n    item.SubItems.Add(entry.Key);\r\n    item.Tag = &quot;1&quot;;\r\n        \r\n    // Add to the listView\r\n    dwgList.Items.Add(item);\r\n\r\nThen, in your runEISD routine, skip the items with Tag = &quot;1&quot; and change their Tags properties to, say Tag = &quot;0&quot; in order to indicate that they are old items from now on:\r\n\r\n     private void runEISD_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                foreach(ListViewItem item in dwgList.Items)\r\n                {\r\n                    if(Convert.ToString(item.Tag) == &quot;1&quot;)\r\n                    {\r\n                        item.Tag = &quot;0&quot;; //important!\r\n                    }\r\n                    else\r\n                    {\r\n                        //MsgBox the item or add it to the dictionary\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\nHope that helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227762/assigning-the-rows-from-a-listview-to-a-dictionary-on-button-click/58228501#58228501","title":"Assigning the rows from a listView to a dictionary on button click"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":8913913,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1045216842288268/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sami Aji","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8913913/sami-aji"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2,"user_id":8913913,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1045216842288268/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sami Aji","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8913913/sami-aji"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570151410,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570149734,"creation_date":1570142441,"last_edit_date":1570146689,"question_id":58227762,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227762","body_markdown":"Web programmer trying to learn C# here, I&#39;m trying to create a message box that iterates through the remaining rows in a listView on a buttonClick event.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure where to start with this.

For example, if I  swap out the code sys.argv[1] with an expression such as x * y * z, everything works as intended.\r\n\r\nIs there a different way to structure the scipy function that will make it all work, or do I need to look into entirely different techniques for this numeric triple integral?\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\nfrom scipy import integrate\r\n\r\n#numbers passed in from website via PHP function, these are used as the bounds for integration\r\nx_lower = float(sys.argv[2])\r\n\r\nx_upper = float(sys.argv[3])\r\n\r\ny_lower = float(sys.argv[4])\r\n\r\ny_upper = float(sys.argv[5])\r\n\r\nz_lower = float(sys.argv[6])\r\n\r\nz_upper = float(sys.argv[7])\r\n\r\n#sys.argv[1] is the expression that users on the website input and is the function being integrated, an example would be: x*y*z\r\nfunc = lambda x, y, z: sys.argv[1]\r\n\r\n\r\nans, err = (integrate.nquad(func,[[x_lower,x_upper],[y_lower,y_upper],[z_lower,z_upper]]))\r\n\r\nprint(ans) ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227760/triple-integral-function-does-not-work-when-passed-in-as-command-line-argument","title":"Triple Integral Function does not work when Passed in as Command Line Argument"},{"tags":["caching",".net-core","reference","package","nuget"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5221,"user_id":3561275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b02ea3c2fa706ad780110f81f6fb55d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omair Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3561275/omair-majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570142866,"post_id":58227757,"comment_id":102830426,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache#comment102830426_58227757"},{"owner":{"reputation":2294,"user_id":1236694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77f6b46fe521c6807aefe4a2c33c2320?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BaltoStar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1236694/baltostar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5221,"user_id":3561275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b02ea3c2fa706ad780110f81f6fb55d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omair Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3561275/omair-majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570148810,"post_id":58227757,"comment_id":102831622,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache#comment102831622_58227757"},{"owner":{"reputation":5221,"user_id":3561275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b02ea3c2fa706ad780110f81f6fb55d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omair Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3561275/omair-majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570160066,"post_id":58227757,"comment_id":102833591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache#comment102833591_58227757"},{"owner":{"reputation":2294,"user_id":1236694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77f6b46fe521c6807aefe4a2c33c2320?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BaltoStar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1236694/baltostar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5221,"user_id":3561275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b02ea3c2fa706ad780110f81f6fb55d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omair Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3561275/omair-majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570222900,"post_id":58227757,"comment_id":102858448,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache#comment102858448_58227757"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2294,"user_id":1236694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77f6b46fe521c6807aefe4a2c33c2320?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BaltoStar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1236694/baltostar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570234873,"post_id":58243583,"comment_id":102860835,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache/58243583#comment102860835_58243583"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5221,"user_id":3561275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b02ea3c2fa706ad780110f81f6fb55d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Omair Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3561275/omair-majid"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570226285,"creation_date":1570226285,"answer_id":58243583,"question_id":58227757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243583","body_markdown":"First, the &quot;open source package manager&quot; behaviour you describe is not really an &quot;open source package manager&quot; behaviour. It&#39;s an implementation of *some* package managers. Java&#39;s Maven (`mvn`), for example, does the same thing as .NET Core and you can&#39;t claim maven is closed source.\r\n\r\nSecond, some package managers, such as `npm` copy over all dependencies into a package directory (eg, `node_modules`) because they use sources, not binaries, and because they grab transitive sources and multiple dependencies same names but different versions. NuGet doesn&#39;t do that. It uses binaries only and doesn&#39;t support multiple versions. NuGet only resolves exactly one version for each dependency in your project. [See this stackoverflow post for more information](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49307481/supporting-multiple-versions-of-nuget-package-in-one-library-nuget-package). The exact version resolved and used is written out to the `.deps.json` file in your build directory.\r\n\r\n\r\nThird, .NET Core&#39;s Self-Contained Deployments - which are meant to be executible/distributable without any other additional dependencies - don&#39;t make use of the package cache. When you publish your application (`dotnet publish` on the command line), all the dependencies are copied to the publish directory. The version is that in the `deps.json` file, like I said above.\r\n\r\nSo the main nuget package cache - which is shared on your system with other projects - is just a simple cache of binaries for .NET Core. There&#39;s no reason it has to be unique to your project to copied over to your project directory.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227757/net-core-pull-down-nuget-packages-to-user-cache/58243583#58243583","title":".NET Core pull-down NuGet packages to User cache"}],"owner":{"reputation":2294,"user_id":1236694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77f6b46fe521c6807aefe4a2c33c2320?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"BaltoStar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1236694/baltostar"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570226285,"creation_date":1570142414,"question_id":58227757,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58227757","body_markdown":"I have a `.NET Core 2.2.0` app that references various `NuGet` packages.\r\n\r\n`.NET Core` relies on `PackageReference` style packages defined in `.csproj` project files.
