making a simple app that lets you upload an image, which has some subposts (like details).\r\nI&#39;ve correctly made the upload function and process for the main image. But, when finishing up my function for the subposts process, I&#39;ve encountered an issue (not error), which I know exactly whats causing it and where, but don&#39;t know what to do to fix it. (noob here)\r\nI&#39;m using Firebase-Realtime for this app.\r\n\r\nIn Xcode, I have a button which lets you save all images (including subposts) to the database.\r\n\r\nThis is ideally what it should look like:\r\n\r\n[![this is ideally what it should look like][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s very simple.\r\n\r\nSo, what&#39;s the problem?\r\n\r\nI have a loop that uploads all subposts to the database, the loop counts each subpost selected, and puts it in an array.\r\n```\r\nvar imagePaths = [String]()\r\nvar counter = 0\r\nfunc bulkUpload(_ images: [UIImage], completion: @escaping ([String]) -&gt; Void) {\r\n    for image in images {\r\n        uploadSubPosts(image) { (urlPath) in\r\n            imagePaths.append(urlPath)\r\n            counter += 1\r\n            if counter == images.count {\r\n                completion(imagePaths)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow, as you can see, it actually uploads each subpost individually (because of the array), but, the way I&#39;d ideally like it, has it all in a child node.\r\nAnd, because of it, it uploads many instead of one.\r\nHere is the database right after posting the set of images.\r\n\r\n[![here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSo it&#39;s weird but makes sense.\r\nWhat I&#39;d like is to remove those that don&#39;t have the number of subpost images selected. In the pic, I selected 3 images, not 6. And, as you can see there is one of them that is perfect, but 2 that aren&#39;t necessary.\r\n\r\nSo why don&#39;t I remove `for image in images`?\r\nBecause underneath it (`uploadSubPosts()`) takes an argument.\r\nAnd can&#39;t remove it. Only thing I thought about was adding an array there, but because of the way I made the subposts function, I can only put images in it, hence the `image`\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance if you decide to help!!\r\nBy the way [here is the full subposts function][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/6RxTy.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/rxKkO.png\r\n  [3]: https://pastebin.com/r6XL1TaC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260477/how-can-i-fix-a-swift-firebase-looping-images-issue","title":"How can I fix a swift + firebase looping images issue?"},{"tags":["java","post","apache-httpclient-4.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8271,"user_id":1745544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92a0f69d86d214e0cffceb76c6e3f09f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"OldProgrammer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1745544/oldprogrammer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570389308,"post_id":58260476,"comment_id":102889648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260476/how-do-i-send-a-post-http-request-using-java-that-contains-a-file#comment102889648_58260476"},{"owner":{"reputation":8271,"user_id":1745544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92a0f69d86d214e0cffceb76c6e3f09f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"OldProgrammer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1745544/oldprogrammer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570389377,"post_id":58260476,"comment_id":102889664,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260476/how-do-i-send-a-post-http-request-using-java-that-contains-a-file#comment102889664_58260476"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":10640283,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/815924b665532197ed8fd5d1d72a0076?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10640283/matt"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8271,"user_id":1745544,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":23,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92a0f69d86d214e0cffceb76c6e3f09f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"OldProgrammer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1745544/oldprogrammer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570438334,"post_id":58260476,"comment_id":102899933,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260476/how-do-i-send-a-post-http-request-using-java-that-contains-a-file#comment102899933_58260476"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":10640283,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/815924b665532197ed8fd5d1d72a0076?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10640283/matt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":10640283,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/815924b665532197ed8fd5d1d72a0076?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10640283/matt"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570438237,"creation_date":1570389244,"last_edit_date":1570438237,"question_id":58260476,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260476","body_markdown":"I have done lots of googling and trial and error but can&#39;t get this to work.\r\n\r\nI am trying to send a HTTP POST request using JAVA that includes a file to be sent.\r\nThis is the code I have tried that doesn&#39;t seem to work for some reason:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void iSendARequestToAnAPI() throws Exception {\r\n\r\n  //This is the httpClient that you will use to send your http request\r\n  CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.createDefault();\r\n  HttpPost httpPost = new HttpPost(&quot;https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/document&quot;);\r\n\r\n  httpPost.setHeader(&quot;tolerance&quot;, &quot;strict&quot;);\r\n  httpPost.setHeader(&quot;Content-Type&quot;, &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;);\r\n  httpPost.setHeader(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;Bearer xxxx&quot;);\r\n\r\n  File file = new File(&quot;C:\\\\Matt\\\\GBG\\\\drivinglicence.jpg&quot;);\r\n\r\n  HttpEntity entity = MultipartEntityBuilder\r\n    .create()\r\n    .addBinaryBody(&quot;file&quot;, file, ContentType.create(&quot;image/jpeg&quot;), file.getName())\r\n    .build();\r\n        \r\n  httpPost.setEntity(entity);\r\n\r\n  //Send the request\r\n  CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(httpPost);\r\n\r\n  //Close the http client\r\n  httpClient.close();\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor info, this is the curl command taken from a Postman request that works:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -X POST \\\r\n  https://idaasstaging.gbgplc.com/verify/documents/v2/document \\\r\n  -H &#39;Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded&#39;

This line in startup.cs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices.AddScoped&lt;IServiceProvider, ServiceProvider&gt;();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreaks my app, can&#39;t debug, just stops after saying that the build was successful.  No errors.  No exceptions.  If I comment out this line, all works again and the app runs.\r\n\r\nWhy is that happening?  The reason I want to inject IServiceProvider is because it is required by ActivatorUtilities and I&#39;m using that in the BaseController to make it easy to validate like such:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic MyController(IServiceProvider serviceProvider) : base(serviceProvider) { }\r\n\r\n[HttpPost]\r\npublic ActionResult Post(MyViewModel viewModel)\r\n{\r\n    ValidateFor&lt;MyValidator&gt;(viewModel);\r\n\r\n    if (!IsValid)\r\n    {\r\n         ... error stuff\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return Ok(&quot;Success!&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the BaseController\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nprotected IserviceProvider ServiceProvider { get; set; }\r\n\r\npublic BaseController(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)\r\n{\r\n    ServiceProvider = serviceProvider;\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void ValidateFor&lt;TValidator&gt;(object instance) where TValidator : IValidator\r\n{\r\n     // injected ServiceProvider here as a protected property of the base controller\r\n     var validator = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance&lt;TValidator&gt;(ServiceProvider);\r\n\r\n      var result = validator.Validate(instance);\r\n\r\n      if (result.IsValid)\r\n      {\r\n            return;\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      ... process errors\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# SOLUTION\r\n\r\nThe solution is to use `IServiceProvider` in the right way within the context of the controller.\r\n\r\nSo instead of:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validator = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance&lt;TValidator&gt;(ServiceProvider);\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet rid of the dependency entirely in your controller and use this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar validator = HttpContext.RequestServces.GetService&lt;TValidator&gt;();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260474/asp-net-3-0-iserviceprovider-cannot-inject","title":"Asp.net 3.0

The initial value of this [comes from the ELF meta-information in your binary][2]. Do `readelf -Wl example`.

It seems something like DP problem which I couldn&#39;t find answer for.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n\r\n&gt; There are ‘n’ ads. Each ad has an effectiveness value associated with\r\n&gt; it which is given in an array of size ‘n’ in the format [v1, v2, …,\r\n&gt; vn], where ‘v1’ is the effectiveness value of the first ad, ‘v2’ is\r\n&gt; the effectiveness value of the second ad, and so on. The show in which\r\n&gt; these ads will be shown is ‘m’ length long (starting from 0 till m),\r\n&gt; and the time when the ads can be shown is given in the format [(a1,\r\n&gt; b1), (a2, b2), …, (an, bn)], where ith tuple in the array denotes the\r\n&gt; timing of the ith ad in the format (start_time, end_time). Note that\r\n&gt; any ‘ai’ and ‘bi’ cannot be smaller than 0 and cannot be larger than\r\n&gt; ‘m’. When you choose to show an ad, you cannot show another ad within\r\n&gt; 4 minutes of it’s end. So if you select to show the ad having timings\r\n&gt; as (2, 4), then you cannot show another ad before 9, hence next ad\r\n&gt; cannot be (8, 10), but it can be (9, 12). You have to select the ads\r\n&gt; to show to the audience such that you maximize the sum of the\r\n&gt; effectiveness values of the ads, given the above constraints.

Then I checked the quota, which I suspect is the issue because I got a blank value in the queries per day. I could still edit the value, but those values didn&#39;t take effect. It eventually transitioned to 0 and after that, I can no longer edit it (This is after some editing and refresh).\r\n\r\nWhen I looked at my email, it shows that they sent me an email with the following subject and content.\r\n\r\n&gt; Subject: [FYI] YouTube disabled your inactive project’s access to YouTube Data API Service\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; Dear YouTube API Developer,\r\n\r\n&gt; According to our records, your project has been inactive for the past 90 consecutive days. In accordance with the YouTube API Services Developer Policies (link), we disabled your project’s access to and use of the YouTube Data API Service.\r\n\r\n&gt; This will not affect other Google API Services that you may have enabled on this project.\r\n\r\n&gt; For reference, your inactive project number is *my_project_number*\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n&gt; If you desire to access and use YouTube Data API Service, or believe you were disabled in error, you may complete and submit this form to get in touch with us.\r\n\r\n \r\n&gt; Thanks,\r\n\r\n&gt; YouTube API Services team\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form was included in the email, but since you haven&#39;t received one, here&#39;s what you need to do as stated [here][1].\r\n\r\n&gt; If the API is indeed enabled, then this means that your project’s access to YouTube Data API Service has been disabled.\r\n\r\n&gt; You should’ve received a notice via email regarding this action, which also contains the steps that need to be taken to regain the project’s access.

The Queries Per Day for our registered app has been set to &quot;unlimited&quot; trough all this time AFAIK, and we only use the youtube.search-list API.\r\nSuddenly, three weeks back, access to the search function was no longer working. Turns out the quota for daily queries was set to blank(no number, no nothing). When trying to change it we get &quot;enter a number in the range 0 to .&quot;\r\n\r\nFirst of all we linked the app to a billing account to be able to adjust the quota. But it was still not working. Then we contacted YouTube and filled out a big form to increase the quota. We got reply from YouTube that the quota request was granted. But we are still not able to set/change the quota. I&#39;ve tried replying to to quota mail, but I guess the mail is not monitored.\r\n\r\nWe see others have had similar issues, and the solution seems to have been to contact YouTube. But we have not found any way to contact them regarding YouTube data API support queries except here on stackoverflow(we do not have a paid support plan). So we&#39;re posting here hoping that anyone from YouTube can respond - or to get tips from users that have been in the same situation.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nWe have now tried two things:\r\n* Removing and adding back in YouTube data API v3 in the registered app. Did not help\r\n* Activating YouTube data API v3 on another app we have registered - this gave us a daily quota of 10000(but we would definatly prefer not to have to change to another API key)\r\n\r\nUPDATE 2:\r\nInfo we left out that might be relevant. We recently went trough a process with Google filling out the &quot;YouTube API Services Form&quot;(a google docs form). We went back and forth with the google team, replacing logos, adding ToS links, changing UI etc. until we got a:\r\n&quot;Thanks for your response to the Audit Form. We will  conduct our audit based on the information you provided.  We will notify you if additional information is needed or when we completed our review. Thank you for your cooperation.&quot;\r\nAfter this we have heard nothing.\r\n\r\nToday we can see that the quota is back to 10000... We did send a second request for quota raise and I also sent a mail to the Audit Form team. Not sure which one did the trick - have received no response. And that&#39;s probably the most annoying thing about this - the complete lack of feedback.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260446/youtube-data-api-v3-queries-per-day-quota-issue","title":"YouTube Data API v3 Queries Per Day quota issue"},{"tags":["haskell","palindrome"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12170465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae2b338af2c4181e1f5f06671cc06958?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piamoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170465/piamoon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570389832,"post_id":58260471,"comment_id":102889769,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260444/ispalindrome-function-in-haskell-gives-an-error/58260471#comment102889769_58260471"},{"owner":{"reputation":3018,"user_id":2018455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e75a41fc224930ef1fa9ddcc9c714174?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Neil Locketz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2018455/neil-locketz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12170465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae2b338af2c4181e1f5f06671cc06958?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piamoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170465/piamoon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570389898,"post_id":58260471,"comment_id":102889779,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260444/ispalindrome-function-in-haskell-gives-an-error/58260471#comment102889779_58260471"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12170465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae2b338af2c4181e1f5f06671cc06958?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piamoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170465/piamoon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570389971,"post_id":58260471,"comment_id":102889793,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260444/ispalindrome-function-in-haskell-gives-an-error/58260471#comment102889793_58260471"},{"owner":{"reputation":50315,"user_id":849891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYKQi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Ness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/849891/will-ness"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12170465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae2b338af2c4181e1f5f06671cc06958?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piamoon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170465/piamoon"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570399542,"post_id":58260471,"comment_id":102891644,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260444/ispalindrome-function-in-haskell-gives-an-error/58260471#comment102891644_58260471"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3018,"user_id":2018455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e75a41fc224930ef1fa9ddcc9c714174?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Neil Locketz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2018455/neil-locketz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3018,"user_id":2018455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e75a41fc224930ef1fa9ddcc9c714174?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Neil Locketz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2018455/neil-locketz"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570389798,"last_edit_date":1570389798,"creation_date":1570389222,"answer_id":58260471,"question_id":58260444,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58260471","body_markdown":"The problem is you need to constrain the polymorphic type `a`.

I&#39;ll present two, each with their pros and cons:\r\n\r\n**1. CSV**\r\n\r\nSimply  save your file to a .csv using [DataFrame.to_csv][1]:\r\n```\r\ntopics_data.to_csv(&#39;path_to_file.csv&#39;)\r\n```\r\nYou can then proceed to parse this csv file in your client application, i.e., whatever application is going to use your scraped data.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n\r\n - Simple to save\r\n - Very barebones; further processing would be simple\r\n\r\nCons\r\n\r\n - Very barebones; if you need any sort of structure, you won&#39;t have any flexibility\r\n\r\n**2. SQLITE**\r\n\r\nYou can also opt to store the dataframe in sqlite using [DataFrame.to_sql][2]:\r\n```\r\nimport sqlite3\r\n\r\ndb_file = &#39;my.db&#39;\r\n# This creates a new database file if it doesn&#39;t exist\r\ndb_conn = sqlite3.connect(db_file)\r\n# This creates a new table &#39;topics_data&#39; if it doesn&#39;t exist\r\ntopics_data.to_sql(&#39;topics_data&#39;, con=db_conn)\r\n```\r\nPros\r\n\r\n - Might be easier to parse for your client\r\n - SQL is a very strong query language.

If you wish to do this on your own, then You can autowire all the variables in properties/yml file into a Bean using\r\n    `ConfigurationProperties` then use this bean as method parameter in\r\n    your bean creation method.    \r\n    check [this][2] out\r\n 3. Use `@Value{}` in your AppConfig class and use it in your Datasource creation method.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/howto-data-access.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260433/autowired-environment-variable-is-null-when-bean-annotated-method-is-executed/58260528#58260528","title":"Autowired Environment variable is NULL when @Bean annotated method is executed"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":1946236,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/311b00e8bbb874776ff1b10ebeb05f66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aluthren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946236/aluthren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570569124,"post_id":58282254,"comment_id":102952185,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260433/autowired-environment-variable-is-null-when-bean-annotated-method-is-executed/58282254#comment102952185_58282254"},{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":9895743,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hmXfqlOo04k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAVg/P3UpFbdwkY4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dhruv Saksena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9895743/dhruv-saksena"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":1946236,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/311b00e8bbb874776ff1b10ebeb05f66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aluthren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946236/aluthren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570610315,"post_id":58282254,"comment_id":102962999,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260433/autowired-environment-variable-is-null-when-bean-annotated-method-is-executed/58282254#comment102962999_58282254"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":9895743,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hmXfqlOo04k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAVg/P3UpFbdwkY4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dhruv Saksena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9895743/dhruv-saksena"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570521277,"creation_date":1570521277,"answer_id":58282254,"question_id":58260433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58282254","body_markdown":"Not really sure what is there in controllers.xml .\r\nBut I was able to fetch environment variable and use it.\r\n\r\nI placed the properties you mentioned in application.yml in /src/main/resources\r\n\r\nI used Spring boot-2.1.9 version to make it work and below is my pom.xml-\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

Also running &quot;RUN ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages&quot; in the docker files shows &quot;PIL&quot; and &quot;Pillow-6.2.0.dist-info&quot; in dist-packages, and the PIL directory includes many code files.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run my container locally, trying to import in python using &quot;from PIL import Image&quot; results in error &quot;No module named PIL&quot;.  I&#39;ve tried variations like &quot;import Image&quot;, but PIL doesn&#39;t seem to be installed in the context in which the code is running when I start the container.  \r\n\r\nBefore the line &quot;from PIL import Image&quot;, I added &quot;import subprocess&quot; and &#39;print(subprocess.check_output(&quot;ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages&quot;.split()))&#39;\r\n\r\nThis *ls* output matches what I get when running it in the docker file, except &quot;PIL&quot; and &quot;Pillow-6.2.0.dist-info&quot; are missing.  Why are those two in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages when I run the docker file but not when my container is started locally?\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to include Pillow in my container?  The referenced Github page also shows that I can deploy libraries by including the files (in code/lib of model package), but to get files compatible with Ubuntu 16.04 (which the docker container uses; I&#39;m on a Mac), I&#39;d probably copy them from the docker container after running &quot;RUN pip3 install Pillow&quot; in my docker file, and it seems odd that I would need to get files from the docker container to deploy to the docker container.\r\n\r\nMy docker file looks like:\r\n```\r\nARG TFS_VERSION\r\n\r\nFROM tensorflow/serving:${TFS_VERSION} as tfs\r\nFROM ubuntu:16.04\r\nLABEL com.amazonaws.sagemaker.capabilities.accept-bind-to-port=true\r\n\r\nCOPY --from=tfs /usr/bin/tensorflow_model_server /usr/bin/tensorflow_model_server\r\n\r\n# nginx + njs\r\nRUN \\\r\n    apt-get update &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends curl &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    curl -s http://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key | apt-key add - &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    echo &#39;deb http://nginx.org/packages/ubuntu/ xenial nginx&#39; &gt;&gt; /etc/apt/sources.list &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    apt-get update &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    apt-get -y install --no-install-recommends nginx nginx-module-njs python3 python3-pip python3-setuptools &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    apt-get clean\r\n\r\nRUN pip3 install Pillow\r\n\r\n# cython, falcon, gunicorn, tensorflow-serving\r\nRUN \\\r\n    pip3 install --no-cache-dir cython falcon gunicorn gevent requests grpcio protobuf tensorflow &amp;&amp; \\\r\n    pip3 install --no-dependencies --no-cache-dir tensorflow-serving-api \r\n\r\nCOPY ./ /\r\n\r\nARG TFS_SHORT_VERSION\r\nENV SAGEMAKER_TFS_VERSION &quot;${TFS_SHORT_VERSION}&quot;\r\nENV PATH &quot;$PATH:/sagemaker&quot;\r\n\r\nRUN pip3 show Pillow\r\nRUN ls /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried installing Pillow on the same line as cython and other dependencies, but the result is the same...those dependencies are in /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages both at the time the container is built and when the container is started locally, while &quot;PIL&quot; and &quot;Pillow-6.2.0.dist-info&quot; are only present when the container is built.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260409/no-module-named-pil-after-run-pip3-install-pillow-in-docker-container-neith","title":"&quot;No module named PIL&quot; after &quot;RUN pip3 install Pillow&quot; in docker container; neither PIL nor Pillow present in dist-packages directory"},{"tags":["javascript","runtime","frame-rate","requestanimationframe"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":347,"user_id":12105419,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDb3FY4Pf4T-ogk-aiT7m4NHJmgnmIOI3LXxcpj=k-s128","display_name":"Lior Hai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105419/lior-hai"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570389220,"creation_date":1570389220,"answer_id":58260469,"question_id":58260406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58260469","body_markdown":"In the loop function check the time passed between executions.\r\n\r\n    let lastTime = new Date();\r\n    function loop() { \r\n        const currentTime = new Date();\r\n        // currentTime - lastTime is the number of milliseconds passed from last loop \r\n        const fps = 1000 / (currentTime - lastTime);\r\n        lastTime = currentTime;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260406/calculate-fps-of-html5-canvas-game-with-javascript/58260469#58260469","title":"calculate fps of html5 canvas game with javascript"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12105861,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c27df86d3105d1e97c55531885877097?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mrbeast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12105861/mrbeast"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58260469,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570389220,"creation_date":1570388703,"question_id":58260406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260406","body_markdown":"I am creating a html5 canvas game and want to check how many frames pass in one second.

But then the negotiation somehow stalls.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n - What is the meaning of **&quot;The underlying mechanism context has not been initialized&quot;**? Is this an indication that some configuration is missing? \r\n\r\n - What is the meaning of &quot;SpNegoContext.acceptSecContext: **negotiated result = ACCEPT_INCOMPLETE&quot;**? Does it mean that the negotiation has failed, or that more information is required?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Additional information:**\r\n\r\n - Keycloak version is 7.0.0\r\n\r\n - Chrome, Firefox and IE behave the same, so I think they delegate the spnego negotiation to the OS.\r\n\r\n - I start the browsers on the host where keycloak is running. There are posts [1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51082273/browsers-keeps-sending-ntlm-token-instead-of-kerberos-how-to-solve-it), [2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973355/defective-token-detected-error-ntlm-not-kerberos-with-kerberos-spring-securi/3410254#34102549) that suggest that having client and server on the same machine can lead to a NTLM token.\r\n\r\n - The logs above are the ones I get when accessing keycloak by localhost. When I&#39;m using the IP address or the fully qualified host name, I get an exception instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\n16:44:08,698 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Debug is  true storeKey true useTicketCache false useKeyTab true doNotPrompt true ticketCache is null isInitiator false KeyTab is C:\\keycloak\\standalone\\configuration\\keycloak.keytab refreshKrb5Config is false principal is HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL tryFirstPass is false useFirstPass is false storePass is false clearPass is false\r\n16:44:08,704 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) principal is HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL\r\n16:44:08,705 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Will use keytab\r\n16:44:08,705 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Commit Succeeded\r\n16:44:08,705 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2)\r\n16:44:08,706 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Found KeyTab C:\\keycloak\\standalone\\configuration\\keycloak.keytab for HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL\r\n16:44:08,707 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Found KeyTab C:\\keycloak\\standalone\\configuration\\keycloak.keytab for HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL\r\n16:44:08,709 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Found KeyTab C:\\keycloak\\standalone\\configuration\\keycloak.keytab for HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL\r\n16:44:08,711 INFO  [stdout] (default task-2) Found KeyTab C:\\keycloak\\standalone\\configuration\\keycloak.keytab for HTTP/keycloak.local@KEYCLOAK.LOCAL\r\n16:44:08,712 WARN  [org.keycloak.federation.kerberos.impl.SPNEGOAuthenticator] (default task-2) SPNEGO login failed: java.security.PrivilegedActionException: GSSException: Defective token detected (Mechanism level: GSSHeader did not find the right tag)\r\n        at java.security.AccessController.doPrivileged(Native Method)\r\n        at javax.security.auth.Subject.doAs(Unknown Source)\r\n        at org.keycloak.federation.kerberos.impl.SPNEGOAuthenticator.authenticate(SPNEGOAuthenticator.java:68)\r\n        at org.keycloak.storage.ldap.LDAPStorageProvider.authenticate(LDAPStorageProvider.java:692)\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260403/keycloak-spnego-authentication-fails-with-the-underlying-mechanism-context-has","title":"keycloak spnego authentication fails with &quot;The underlying mechanism context has not been initialized&quot;, &quot;result = ACCEPT_INCOMPLETE&quot;"},{"tags":["twitter","postman"],"owner":{"reputation":585,"user_id":8272698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DuuIt8xKCLw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/rQ67Bbi8SKY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Julian Silvestri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8272698/julian-silvestri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":585,"user_id":8272698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DuuIt8xKCLw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAL8/rQ67Bbi8SKY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Julian Silvestri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8272698/julian-silvestri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570390367,"creation_date":1570388676,"last_edit_date":1570390367,"question_id":58260402,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260402","body_markdown":"I am trying to simply retrieve tweets. \r\nI have followed the twitter api tutorials and I cannot seem to get past this error code. \r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;errors&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;code&quot;: 215,\r\n                &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Bad Authentication data.&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is my postman..\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI have regenerated all the consumer keys and access tokens and still same error.\r\n\r\nReferencing these questions that did not help: \r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/17143985/twitter-api-error-215\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29972426/twitter-error-code-215-bad-authentication-data?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/12684765/twitter-api-returns-error-215-bad-authentication-data\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/32171374/how-to-make-calls-to-twitter-api-using-postman-client\r\n\r\nthis walkthrough is the same process... does not work as well\r\nhttps://www.dataneb.com/post/how-to-make-calls-to-twitter-apis-using-postman-client\r\n\r\nIve tried and tried and nothing seems to work. \r\nAm I missing something?

I suggest you add a simple member function to `DClass` instead of inheriting from `Data`, and also remove the `abstract` keyword from `Data`. `DClass` should look like this:\r\n\r\n    data class DClass(val p1: String, val p2: String)\r\n        fun newData(): Data = Data(p1)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthen you can construct a `Data` instance from the `body()` of the response:\r\n\r\n    call.execute().body()?.newData()?.run { println(&quot;$a1 $a2&quot;) }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/google/gson/blob/9d44cbc19a73b45971c4ecb33c8d34d673afa210/gson/src/main/java/com/google/gson/internal/UnsafeAllocator.java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260386/retrofit-skips-init-block-of-a-data-class-while-initializing/58264856#58264856","title":"Retrofit skips init { } block of a data class while initializing"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12171735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-go3UfJqRUa0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfCwZc-bzlph2cuRRCRL9Lnkwk-DQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ahmad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12171735/ahmad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12171735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-go3UfJqRUa0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfCwZc-bzlph2cuRRCRL9Lnkwk-DQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ahmad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12171735/ahmad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570432400,"creation_date":1570388510,"last_edit_date":1570396294,"question_id":58260386,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260386","body_markdown":"I&#39;m going to set variables in class `Data` based on the arguments of `DClass`\r\n```\r\nabstract class Data(p: String) {\r\n    var a1: String\r\n    var a2: String\r\n\r\n    init {\r\n        &quot;&quot;&quot;(\\w+)(\\d+)&quot;&quot;&quot;.toRegex().find(p)!!.groupValues.run {\r\n            a1 = &quot;a1 is ${get(1)}&quot;\r\n            a2 = &quot;a2 is ${get(2)}&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ndata class DClass(val p1: String, val p2: String) : Data(p1)\r\n```\r\nThen I&#39;m able to get values of `a1` and `a2` after `DClass` is created:\r\n```\r\nDClass(&quot;string1&quot;, &quot;string2&quot;).run { println(&quot;$a1 $a2&quot;) }\r\n```\r\nit returns &quot;a1 is `string` a2 is `1`&quot; as it should\r\n\r\nNext I&#39;m trying to make retrofit initialize DClass from the proper JSON response:\r\n```@GET(&quot;loadDClass&quot;) suspend fun dClass(): DClass```\r\n\r\nand say the program to do the same output of `a1` and `a2`, it just returns:\r\n\r\n&quot;a1 is `null` a2 is `null`&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo I found out that `init{}` block of `Data` is skipped as the retrofit just builds `DClass` but doesn&#39;t do the initialization\r\n\r\nIs it possible to make abstract class&#39; variables be initialized without doing it manually?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260386/retrofit-skips-init-block-of-a-data-class-while-initializing","title":"Retrofit skips init { } block of a data class while initializing"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3308,"user_id":3402703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DDcEo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"PavoDive","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3402703/pavodive"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570394777,"post_id":58260385,"comment_id":102890749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260385/how-to-get-started-with-this-dataset-on-eeg-fourier-transform#comment102890749_58260385"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12173296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCE8IHA9zaezaOgmvGYWJKfsViC3c5Y4pWo8Yly=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"HONGSHEN XU","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12173296/hongshen-xu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570398090,"creation_date":1570388502,"last_edit_date":1570398090,"question_id":58260385,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260385","body_markdown":"I need to perform an EEG fourier Transform to plot data.

issue, as Matt pointed out, is that you are segueing to the detailVC and then segueing back to the original VC. This is creating a new instance of the original VC.\r\n\r\nWhat you should do, in your VC with the table view, is instantiate and present the destination view controller when a cell is selected. So you should replace `performSegue(withIdentifier: &quot;segue&quot;, sender: self)` with something like:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nlet storyboard = UIStoryboard(name: &quot;Main&quot;, bundle: .main)\r\nvar destinationVC = (storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: &quot;DestinationVC&quot;) as! DestinationViewController)\r\npresent(destinationVC!, animated: ture, completion: nil)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** View Controller storyboard identifiers can be set in the interface builder. So, if you are wanting to use this line: `var destinationVC = (storyboard.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: &quot;DestinationVC&quot;) as!

When I create methods on kids, I can call them from within methods on adults and get a result. I can also call them from my .ejs views. However, when I create methods on house, I can only get a result from my .ejs views and get undefined when called from within methods on adults.

This is a single child error (for me). If it did not work in the view, I would assume that the method `getFullStreet()` was the problem, but it works in the view. If the array methods could not be called within the parent, I would assume the issue was with trying to access `getFullStreet()` in the parent. \r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n\r\n**SOLUTION**\r\nI was fetching `theAdult` in my call to show view.ejs, but I was then actually relying on `currentAdult` which referred to `req.adult` and did not have the fields populated. My solution was to add a pre hook to the adult schema that always populates house on find.\r\n\r\n*in adult.js*\r\n\r\n    adultSchema.pre(&#39;find&#39;, function() {\r\n      this.populate(&#39;house&#39;)\r\n    })","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260357/accessing-child-methods-in-parent-for-mongoose-succeeds-in-array-and-fails-with","title":"Accessing child methods in parent for mongoose succeeds in array and fails with single child"},{"tags":["python","gcc","pip","azure-web-sites"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15751,"user_id":4989676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jP8H6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Pan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4989676/peter-pan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570482480,"creation_date":1570482480,"answer_id":58277173,"question_id":58260355,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58277173","body_markdown":"Due to you were using Azure WebApp for Linux based on Docker Container, the MSDN blog [`Install Python Modules on Azure App Services`][1] for Azure WebApp for Windows is not useful for your issue.\r\n\r\nSo for your issue of missing `gcc` error, per my experience, the solution to fix it is to configure a custom Linux container which had been pre-installed the gcc tool-chains and then to deploy your app into it from VS Code.\r\n\r\nAs references, please try to follow the documents below.\r\n\r\n1.

Your error message tells that the gstatic.com server doesn&#39;t provide CORS headers for that resource. Without that CORS header, workbox won&#39;t be able to inspect responses for that resource. That makes caching very difficult.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s some discussion about what you&#39;re trying to do here (precache from a CDN) on [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/workbox/issues/604) for workbox. The relevant sentence is:\r\n\r\n&gt; One complication is that this should only work if the CDN supports CORS, because precaching opaque responses and serving them cache-first isn&#39;t a good practice.\r\n\r\nThe [workbox doco](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/handle-third-party-requests#cross-origin_requests_and_opaque_responses) talks more about this caching and opaque responses issue:\r\n\r\n&gt; This response would cache the opaque response and serve it up from that point onwards. The problem is that if that request fails for any reason, Workbox won’t be able to detect this and will continue to serve up the broken response. The user will be in a broken state.\r\n\r\nIn your case, *if* you could force workbox to cache the resources from the CDN (I don&#39;t think you can) then there&#39;s a chance that it would cache an error response or at the very least workbox wouldn&#39;t know when a new version of the resource is available because it can&#39;t inspect the response.\r\n\r\n# Option 1\r\nIf you&#39;re using something like webpack to bundle your code, then you could *not* use the CDN but instead bundle the [firebase code](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase) in with your app. You can look at using a [build tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/guides/precache-files#generating_a_precache_manifest) to automatically generate the precache manifest.\r\n\r\n# Option 2\r\nRemove those `crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;` attributes from the `&lt;script&gt;` tags in your html file. And then remove those bottom 3 items from your precache manifest (for gstatic.com/firebase...). This means that you won&#39;t need the CORS headers but also that those files won&#39;t be precached in the PWA sense. They should still be cached by your browser though, so it will hopefully still work.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I&#39;m also developing a PWA using Onsen :D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260337/precache-firebase-js-files-with-workbox-blocked-by-cors/58446460#58446460","title":"Precache Firebase JS files with Workbox - blocked by CORS"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":8827535,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/017184d2be145d610d6a507a1d8e7e34?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.

But the code design is a bit different.\r\n\r\nI try to be more generic both in the object traversal and in the testing for matches.  I hope that both would be reusable functions.  The traversal takes a predicate and a property name for the children to recurse on (in your case `&#39;ROUTES&#39;`) and returns a function that filters the object supplied to it.\r\n\r\nFor the predicate, I pass the result of calling `matchesRestrictions` with something like your `USER_RESTRICTIONS` object.  The thought is that there will likely be other restrictions possible.  I assume that that if the value is a boolean, then the object must have the same boolean value for that key.  If it is an array, then every item in it must appear in the array at that key.  It&#39;s easy enough to add other types.

But I did test it with another object and a different path to the children:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst obj = {x: {foo: 1, val: 20, kids: {a: {foo: 2, val: 15, kids: {b: {foo: 3, val: 8}, c: {foo: 4, val: 17}, d: {foo: 5, val: 12}}}, e: {foo: 6, val: 5, kids: {f: {foo: 7, val: 23}, g: {foo: 8, val: 17}}}, h: {foo: 9, val: 11, kids: {i: {foo: 10, val: 3}, j: {foo: 11, val: 7}}}}}, y: {foo: 12, val: 8}, z: {foo: 13, val: 25, kids: {k: {foo: 14, val: 18, kids: {l: {foo: 5, val: 3}, m: {foo: 11, val: 7}}}}}}\r\n\r\nconst pred = ({val}) =&gt; val &gt; 10\r\n\r\nfilterObj ( pred, &#39;kids&#39;) (obj)\r\n```\r\n\r\ngetting this result:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{x: {foo: 1, kids: {a: {foo: 2, kids: {c: {foo: 4, val: 17}, d: {foo: 5, val: 12}}, val: 15}, h: {foo: 9, kids: {}, val: 11}}, val: 20}, z: {foo: 13, kids: {k: {foo: 14, kids: {}, val: 18}}, val: 25}}\r\n```\r\n\r\nso it&#39;s at least somewhat reusable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58260332/filter-nested-object-recursively/58275593#58275593","title":"Filter nested object recursively"}],"owner":{"reputation":528,"user_id":3711421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9358692cd6f411b16c4ad4a09ca3d368?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3711421","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3711421/user3711421"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58269132,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570495169,"creation_date":1570388070,"question_id":58260332,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58260332","body_markdown":"I have an object which looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst ROUTES = {\r\n  ACCOUNT: {\r\n    TO: &#39;/account&#39;,\r\n    RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n      shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n    },\r\n    ROUTES: {\r\n      PROFILE: {\r\n        TO: &#39;/account/profile&#39;,\r\n        RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n          shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n        },\r\n        ROUTES: {\r\n          INFORMATION: {\r\n            TO: &#39;/account/profile/information&#39;,\r\n            RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n              shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n              permissions: [&#39;EMAIL&#39;],\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n          PASSWORD: {\r\n            TO: &#39;/account/profile/password&#39;,\r\n            RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n              shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n              permissions: [&#39;EMAIL&#39;, &#39;ADMIN&#39;],\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      COLLECTIONS: {\r\n        TO: &#39;/account/collections&#39;,\r\n        RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n          shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n          permissions: [&#39;ADMIN&#39;],\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      LIKES: {\r\n        TO: &#39;/account/likes&#39;,\r\n        RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n          shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI want to create a function (`getRoutes`) which filters/reduces that object depending on the `RESTRICTIONS` passed in, all `permissions` must match.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction getRoutes(routes, restrictions){\r\n   //...\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst USER_RESTRICTIONS = {\r\n    shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n    permissions: [&#39;EMAIL&#39;],\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst allowedRoutes = getRoutes(ROUTES, USER_RESTRICTIONS)\r\n\r\nallowedRoutes === {\r\n  ACCOUNT: {\r\n    TO: &#39;/account&#39;,\r\n    RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n      shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n    },\r\n    ROUTES: {\r\n      PROFILE: {\r\n        TO: &#39;/account/profile&#39;,\r\n        RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n          shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n        },\r\n        ROUTES: {\r\n          INFORMATION: {\r\n            TO: &#39;/account/profile/information&#39;,\r\n            RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n              shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n              permissions: [&#39;EMAIL&#39;],\r\n            },\r\n          },\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n      LIKES: {\r\n        TO: &#39;/account/likes&#39;,\r\n        RESTRICTIONS: {\r\n          shouldBeLoggedIn: true,\r\n        },\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n} ?

Say you have a value of `1212`. There is no way of knowing whether this corresponds to `DecDec`, `JanFebDec`, `DecJanFeb`, or `JanFebJanFeb`.\r\n 2. You have variable lengths of your strings, since some months are 2-digit and some are 1-digit.\r\n 3. Attempting to rip apart and convert a column of strings (or integers representing string values) is inherently poor data management. It&#39;s prone to breakage, errors, and expensive inefficient querying. Try literally every other solution before you resort to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst thing to ask yourself: ***How does this data get loaded into the table in the first place?***\r\n\r\nSomehow you are locating the integer representation of a month and then concatenating it with other months. Why not cast it as a month name instead of an integer before it makes it to this table? \r\n\r\n\r\nSecond question to ask yourself: ***What is the next step for this data?***\r\n\r\nA series of strings like &quot;JanFebMar&quot; and &quot;MarFebSep&quot; are not particularly flexible, readable, or useful for much. Most likely you&#39;ll have to convert or split these strings later on in your workflow to make them useful.\r\n\r\nI would strongly recommend restructuring the table like so:\r\n\r\n    Columns_with_your_other_data | MONTH1 | MONTH2 | MONTH3\r\n\r\nThis allows you to keep the months organized and distinct, cast them as integers or strings, concatenate them or split them, sort them, filter them, whatever you want, all while avoiding errors and extra pressure on the database. Way more flexible! Way less prone to errors. Way more readable.
