an ``IList&lt;Guid&gt;``, I wish to locate all matches from the context and then include a number of related tables, where outdated data are not included. \r\nBecause of the size of the data, I try to use EF Plus IncludeFilter, to avoid loading all to memory and perform the filtering there. \r\nThe problem occurs when I call ``ToListAsync()`` on the query. IncludeFilter (as far as I can see) then throws a ``System.MissingMethodException : Cannot create an instance of an interface`` exception. \r\n\r\nThe project is done in .NET Core 2.2, and I using Z.EntityFramework.Plus.EFCore 2.0.7\r\n\r\n**Sample project**\r\n\r\nThis sample recreates the issue: https://dotnetfiddle.net/MYukHp\r\n\r\n**Data structure**\r\n\r\nThe database structure centers around the Facts table which contains an immutable Guid, identifing each entry. Entries in all other tables link to this guid to bind together to a single entry. The other tables contain a ``DateTime ValidTo`` to track changes. No entries are ever updated or deleted. Instead, on change a new entry is made with ``ValidTo = DateTime.MaxValue``, and the entry being updated has it&#39;s ``ValidTo`` set to ``DateTime.Now``.\r\nThis ensures that all changes are preserved historically. \r\n\r\nOver time, the vast majority of data will be historical, so it&#39;s crucial that we can filter this out in the SQL query.\r\n\r\nThe data structure for the Fact-table is like this:\r\n```c#\r\npublic class FactModel\r\n{\r\n    public Guid FactId { get; set; }\r\n    public DateTime ValidFrom { get; set; }\r\n    public DateTime ValidTo { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    // Navigation properties\r\n    public IEnumerable&lt;PersonModel&gt; Persons { get; set; }\r\n    // Repeat for all other tables\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAll other tables inherits from a ModelBase, linking them to the Fact table. \r\n``` c#\r\npublic class ModelBase\r\n{\r\n    public Guid FactId { get; set; }    // Link to the Fact\r\n    public FactModel Fact { get; set; }  // Navigation property\r\n    public DateTime ValidFrom { get; set; } \r\n    public DateTime ValidTo { get; set; }   // ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue -&gt; active record\r\n}\r\n```\r\nExample tables for Person and Patient\r\n``` c#\r\npublic class PersonModel : ModelBase\r\n{\r\n\tpublic Guid PersonId { get; set; }    // Key - A new is created on every update\r\n\tpublic string FirstName { get; set; }  // data\r\n\tpublic string LastName { get; set; }   // data\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class PatientModel : ModelBase\r\n{\r\n    public Guid PatientId { get; set; }  // Key - A new is created on every update\r\n    public Guid ActiveCompanyId { get; set; }  // Data\r\n    public int HealthInsuranceGroup { get; set; } // Data\r\n    public PatientStatusType Status { get; set; } // Data\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the parameter to IQueryable&lt;Guid&gt; produces a new error: \r\n``System.InvalidCastException : Unable to cast object of type System.Guid&#39; to type &#39;System.String&#39;``\r\n\r\n**Call sequense**\r\n\r\nThe call sequence is rather complex, but simplified we start by declaring the call parameter ``IQueryable&lt;FactModel&gt; facts``. This is filtered by only adding _Patients_ from the company the user is logged into. Then the search term is applied. Finally, the parameter is transformed into a list containing only the need guids, before calling ``AssignDataToPatientByFactId``.\r\n```c#\r\n// Performing a search for an Address\r\n\r\nIQueryable&lt;FactModel&gt; facts = null;\r\nfacts = _context.Facts.AsNoTracking().Where(p =&gt; p.Patients.Any(a =&gt; a.ActiveCompanyId == _identificationHandler.Identification.CompanyId));\r\nfacts = facts.AsNoTracking().Where(p =&gt; p.Addresses.Where(z =&gt; z.ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue).Any(q =&gt; q.Street.Any() &amp;&amp; q.Street.StartsWith(searchDTO.SearchString)));\r\nreturn await AssignDataToPatient(facts.Select(x =&gt; x.FactId).ToList()), cancel);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic async Task&lt;List&lt;FactModel&gt;&gt; AssignDataToPatientByFactId(IList&lt;Guid&gt; factIds, CancellationToken cancel)\r\n{\r\n    return await _context.Facts.Where(x =&gt; factIds.Contains(x.FactId))\r\n        .IncludeFilter(x =&gt; x.Patients.Where(c =&gt; c.ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue))\r\n        .IncludeFilter(x =&gt; x.Persons.Where(c =&gt; c.ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue))\r\n        .IncludeFilter(x =&gt; x.Communications.Where(c =&gt; c.ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue))\r\n        .IncludeFilter(x =&gt; x.Addresses.Where(c =&gt; c.ValidTo == DateTime.MaxValue))\r\n        .ToListAsync(cancel);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo ``AssignDataToPatientByFactId`` takes a list of guids, finds all matching in the Facts-table and then adds the entries from the other tables where the ``ValidTo`` timestamp is Max. So all other entries should not be included. \r\n\r\nSeparating the code into several statements reveal that IncludeFilter seems to be working, but calling ToListAsync produces the error.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57956018/getting-an-cannot-create-an-instance-of-an-interface-error-with-ef-plus-includ","title":"Getting an &#39;Cannot create an instance of an interface&#39;-error with EF Plus IncludeFilter"},{"tags":["scala","intellij-idea","refactoring"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":95,"user_id":2555560,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000044259680/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tilman Zuckmantel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2555560/tilman-zuckmantel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568731938,"post_id":57956718,"comment_id":102363451,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57956016/intellij-refactoring-move-inner-object-to-own-file/57956718#comment102363451_57956718"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10681,"user_id":7662670,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fPasV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7662670/tim"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568636079,"creation_date":1568636079,"answer_id":57956718,"question_id":57956016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57956718","body_markdown":"The quickest way is to move `sTypes` out of the `types` first.

In the example below `TFoo` contains those three values, `foo`, `bar` and `baz`.\r\n\r\nUsing the `[P in TFoo]` we can tell typescript, that any of those strings can be used as key in the object of type TDirect. VSCode helps with code completion, we can successfully build up `direct`, no errors.\r\n\r\nIn our case `TFoo` is not always the same, in reality it will contain different event names depending of the microservice. So we tried to use generics as seen in TGeneric. And that is where the T is underlined an we get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nType &#39;T&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;string | number | symbol&#39;.\r\n  Type &#39;T&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;symbol&#39;.ts(2322)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is strange though is that VSCode seems to understand what we are trying to do, it still helps with intellisense and correctly highlights `wrong: &quot;value&quot;` as incorrect.\r\n\r\nA `tsc` will result in compiler errors (see above). When moving TGeneric in its own file and when using e.g. `ts-node --files src` (assuming all files live in src) everything runs fine.\r\n\r\nSo we are currently having the problem that we get what we want, as we have intellisense and the code still runs with ts-node. But we actually have a bad feeling about the strange behaviour.\r\n\r\nMaybe anyone has a bullet-proof solution?\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\ntype TFoo = &quot;foo&quot; | &quot;bar&quot; | &quot;baz&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\ntype TDirect = { [P in TFoo]?: any };\r\nconst direct: TDirect = {\r\n  bar: &quot;baz&quot;\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\ntype TGeneric&lt;T&gt; = { [P in T]?: any };\r\nconst generic: TGeneric&lt;TFoo&gt; = {\r\n  bar: &quot;baz&quot;,\r\n  wrong: &quot;value&quot;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57956012/generics-use-type-as-object-key-in-typescript","title":"Generics: use type as object key in typescript"},{"tags":["authorize.net","authorize.net-arb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":192121,"user_id":250259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64839d31baaefafa58120e1a5a503d66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Conde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/250259/john-conde"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568634900,"post_id":57956005,"comment_id":102324490,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57956005/can-we-create-arb-subscription-by-customer-id#comment102324490_57956005"},{"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":9424000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nikul Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9424000/nikul-panchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":192121,"user_id":250259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64839d31baaefafa58120e1a5a503d66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Conde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/250259/john-conde"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568635047,"post_id":57956005,"comment_id":102324564,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57956005/can-we-create-arb-subscription-by-customer-id#comment102324564_57956005"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":192121,"user_id":250259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64839d31baaefafa58120e1a5a503d66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Conde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/250259/john-conde"},"last_editor":{"reputation":192121,"user_id":250259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64839d31baaefafa58120e1a5a503d66?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Conde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/250259/john-conde"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568635461,"last_edit_date":1568635461,"creation_date":1568635144,"answer_id":57956390,"question_id":57956005,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57956390","body_markdown":"Yes, you can create a subscription from a `customerProfileId` as long as you also have the `customerPaymentProfileId` as well. \r\n\r\nHere is sample XML:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;

The categorical data is extremely huge (more than 4 millions different device_id) therefore I can&#39;t use one hot encoder because it create an incredible huge sparse matrix. I did use for the categorical data Tensorflow embedding.\r\nI did use Functional Models and merge the categorical layers and the numerical layer into one. The goal of the Neural Network is to predict future device_id location.\r\nI will put a sniped of the data and then code and the code\r\n\r\n```\r\ndevice_id                    seconds      latitude     longitude\r\n\r\njg4M/taYRc2cBJPGa8c7vw==       752        53.392060    -2.069796\r\njg4M/taYRc2cBJPGa8c8vw==       753        53.392060    -2.069796\r\nPdhyfpkIT8Weslb54thwuQ==       754        51.496483     0.116620   \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI put the device ID in one panda series and transformed into tensors\r\n```python\r\ndata1000 = data1[&#39;device_id&#39;]\r\n\r\ndata_tf = tf.convert_to_tensor(data1000)\r\n\r\nsess = tf.InteractiveSession()  \r\nprint(data_tf.eval())\r\n\r\nsess.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did the same with each one of the numerical columns: Long, Lat and Seconds.\r\nSince now the have dimension (1,) but the embedding layer will add another dimension, the output dimension, then the categorical layer will become (none,1,1) I did reshape the numerical data one into (1,1)\r\nI did this so they can have the same shape when numerical and categorical layers merge. I know this because it id raise an error.\r\nHere is the code for this. I will show the code only for Latitude assuming is self explanatory for Longitude and Seconds since the process is the same.\r\n```python\r\ndata1_lat = data1[&#39;latitude&#39;]\r\n\r\ntype(data1_sec)\r\npandas.core.series.Series\r\ndata1_lat.values.reshape(15904370,1)\r\n\r\ndata_tf_lat = tf.convert_to_tensor(data1_lat)\r\n\r\nsess = tf.InteractiveSession()  \r\nprint(data_tf_lat.eval())\r\n\r\nsess.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we go to the Neural Network\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndata_tf_lat = Input(shape=(1,1))\r\ndata_tf_long = Input(shape=(1,1))\r\ndata_tf_sec = Input(shape=(1,1))\r\ncat_in       = Input(shape=(1,))\r\nembed_layer  = Embedding(input_dim=1, output_dim=1, input_length=(len_data1000))(cat_in)\r\n#embed_layer  = Flatten(embed_layer)\r\nmerged_layer = concatenate([embed_layer,data_tf_lat,data_tf_long,data_tf_sec])\r\noutput       = LSTM(128)(merged_layer)\r\noutput       = Dense(10)(output)\r\noutput       = Dense(1)\r\nmodel        = Model(inputs=[data_tf_lat,data_tf_long,data_tf_sec, cat_in], outputs=[output])\r\n\r\nValueError: Output tensors to a Model must be the output of a Keras `Layer` (thus holding past layer metadata). Found: &lt;keras.layers.core.Dense object at 0x7ff04499db38&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny help\r\nI try several methodologies I find here and in other places but I can&#39;t find a solution?`\r\nThank

As I understand, what you really need when `User` is making a transaction, are not *all the fingerprints*, but *only the matching one*. A solution would be to properly prepare your object when you are loading it from your database. Do not load all the `Fingerprints`, but only the one you are interested in. You can make another property for that in your User class. Write a Linq query or SQL select in your infrastructure layer.\r\n\r\nThis solution might cause another problem. Every time you add a new `Fingerprint`, you will have that redundant property in your `User` class that you don&#39;t need. When you add new `Fingerprint`, this property will not update automatically. If you do not feel comfortable with it, I would suggest you to seperate your read and write models. You can use Tactical DDD patterns for saving, but probably you don&#39;t need them for simple reads.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955950/how-to-paginate-ownsmany-collections/57959852#57959852","title":"How to paginate OwnsMany collections?"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":5860554,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb8ab2b18ae0b0a4a64284412d386e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sponger94","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5860554/sponger94"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1698,"user_id":6524970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2Qn84.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rajan Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6524970/rajan-sharma"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568646951,"creation_date":1568633581,"last_edit_date":1568633780,"question_id":57955950,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955950","body_markdown":"Consider I&#39;m having a domain entity of User.

that `TProc&lt;T&gt;` is implemented as interface you can write this code:\r\n\r\n    type\r\n      TMessageBus = class\r\n      private\r\n        fContainer: TDictionary&lt;string, IInterface&gt;;\r\n      public\r\n        constructor Create;\r\n        destructor Destroy; override;\r\n        procedure Send&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aData: T);\r\n        procedure Subscribe&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aProc: TProc&lt;T&gt;);\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    constructor TMessageBus.Create;\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer := TDictionary&lt;string, IInterface&gt;.Create;\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    destructor TMessageBus.Destroy;\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer.Free;\r\n      inherited;\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    procedure TMessageBus.Send&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aData: T);\r\n    begin\r\n      TProc&lt;T&gt;(fContainer[aName])(aData);\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    procedure TMessageBus.Subscribe&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aProc: TProc&lt;T&gt;);\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer.AddOrSetValue(aName, IInterface(PPointer(@aProc)^));\r\n    end;\r\n\r\nHowever apart from leaving out any validation code this can easily blow up if you do send a different data type than you subscribed. So I would use the `TValue` type here to wrap the passed `TProc&lt;T&gt;` inside a `TProc&lt;TValue&gt;` (from `System.Rtti`). Keep in mind however that `TValue` itself only allows type conversions that also the compiler allows, so it won&#39;t convert `string` to `Integer` and alike - but if required you can then add this yourself:\r\n\r\n    type\r\n      TMessageBus = class\r\n      private\r\n        fContainer: TDictionary&lt;string, TProc&lt;TValue&gt;&gt;;\r\n      public\r\n        constructor Create;\r\n        destructor Destroy; override;\r\n        procedure Send&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aData: T);\r\n        procedure Subscribe&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aProc: TProc&lt;T&gt;);\r\n      end;\r\n    \r\n    constructor TMessageBus.Create;\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer := TDictionary&lt;string, TProc&lt;TValue&gt;&gt;.Create;\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    destructor TMessageBus.Destroy;\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer.Free;\r\n      inherited;\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    procedure TMessageBus.Send&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aData: T);\r\n    var\r\n      proc: TProc&lt;TValue&gt;;\r\n    begin\r\n      if fContainer.TryGetValue(aName, proc) then\r\n        proc(TValue.From&lt;T&gt;(aData));\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    procedure TMessageBus.Subscribe&lt;T&gt;(const aName: string; const aProc: TProc&lt;T&gt;);\r\n    begin\r\n      fContainer.AddOrSetValue(aName,\r\n        procedure(aValue: TValue)\r\n        begin\r\n          aProc(aValue.AsType&lt;T&gt;);\r\n        end);\r\n    end;\r\n\r\nIf you now call `mb.Send(&#39;somestring&#39;, 42);` for example it will raise an `EInvalidCast` exception in `TValue.AsType` because as mentioned before it can&#39;t convert the passed `42` to `string` which is what you specified when you called `Subscribe`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955941/delphi-tdictionary-with-generics/57959713#57959713","title":"Delphi TDictionary with generics"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12073779,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fd5e38530125c8fa901c1046fcd39ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TomaszH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12073779/tomaszh"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":138,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57959713,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568646548,"creation_date":1568633514,"question_id":57955941,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955941","body_markdown":"I need a container with different TProc&lt;T [, T1...]&gt;

best practice is to create a javascript function:\r\n\r\n    function popup(){\r\n    var response=confirm(&quot;this data is validate?&quot;);\r\n    }\r\nThen add attribute on your textbox like this :\r\n\r\n    txtsomeData.Attributes.Add(&quot;Ontextchange&quot;,&quot;popup()&quot;);\r\n\r\nThen if you want to send this response to server you can use ajax with WebMethod like :\r\n\r\n    $.ajax({\r\n                type: &quot;POST&quot;,\r\n                url: &quot;webmethods.aspx/UpdateData&quot;,\r\n                cache: false,\r\n                data: &quot;{ smsCode: &quot; + response+ &quot;}&quot;,\r\n                contentType: &quot;application/json&quot;,\r\n                success: function (response) {\r\n                    if (response.Success)\r\n                    {                     \r\n    \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n\r\nAnd \r\n\r\n    [WebMethod]\r\n    public static void UpdateData(string smsCode)\r\n    {\r\n       \r\n    }\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can put it on \r\n\r\n&gt; `&lt;asp:hiddenfield&gt;`\r\n\r\n using clientId and put your code on popup() JS function after confirm then catch it on your code behind\r\n\r\nI hope this will help

best answer depends on whether this table is only for use with Python and the `dbf` package&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, or if you need to share it with other programs.\r\n\r\n@snakecharmerb is correct in that you need to provide the appropriate code page when you create the dbf file, and if it is only for use with Python and the `dbf` package then you can specify `&#39;utf8&#39;` (instead of `0xf0`) -- but to the best of my knowledge that is not an industry standard specification for dbf files&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.\r\n\r\nIf you need to share the file with other programs, then you&#39;ll need to decide on which of the [many code pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page)&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is appropriate for your data set&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.\r\n\r\nWhen creating the file, add the code page:\r\n\r\n    dbf.table(table_name, table_fields, codepage=...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Disclosure:  I am the author of the [`dbf package`](https://pypi.org/project/dbf/).\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; I added `&#39;utf8&#39;` primarily for my own convenience.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; See the sections on DOS and Windows

greek encodings (for *both* input and output). This program works perfectly on Linux for various output and input languages if I set the appropriate encoding and of course remove the `fflush(stdout)` and `_setmode()`.\r\n\r\nSo on Windows this program will output greek (and english) correctly when I use `std::locale::global(loc)`, but It will not take greek input that I type from the keyboard. The `std::wcout &lt;&lt; yes` outputs gibberish or question marks if I type greek. Apparently `::global` isn&#39;t really global on Windows?\r\n\r\nSo I tried the `.imbue()` method on `wcout` and `wcin` (which also works on Linux) that you see commented out here. When I use any of these two statements and run the program it will (compile properly) present me with a prompt and when I press w/e and then press &#39;enter&#39; it simply exits with no errors or whatnot.\r\n\r\nI have tried a few Windows specific commands but then I got confused too. What should I try and when on Windows is not clear to me.\r\n\r\nSo the question is how I can both input and output greek text properly in Windows like in the program above? I use MSVS 2017 latest updates.

There seems to be some misunderstanding on your part between GraalVM and GraalVM native-image. GraalVM is a fully featured JDK8 that does *support* ahead of time compilation of java applications, but it does not *mandate* it. You can use GraalVM as you would use any other JDK8 (e.g. point `JAVA_HOME` to the GraalVM dir). You just get polyglot support and likely better performance.\r\n\r\nIf you are running JDK11+ have a look at the example maven project https://github.com/graalvm/graal-js-jdk11-maven-demo (as answered here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52932679/use-graalvm-via-the-standard-jdk-11/53185582#53185582) \r\n\r\nIf you are running on JDK8 and insist on not using GraalVM your options are rather limited. You can still use the GraalVM javascript engine but in interpreter mode only resulting in worse performance.

I would suggest that you change the name and use more descriptive types.\r\n    \r\nAdditional Note - Your function `dswap_opt_low` returns a local variable `_instance`. If the returned value is used elsewhere in the program it will result in undefined behaviour and you will get unpredictable results.

Effectively when your block of code, _(the [tag:for-loop])_, is read both `%PROPERTY_NAME%` and `%PROPERTY_VALUE%` already have values which are expanded, _i.e. `PROPERTY_NAME`_. Because you&#39;re modifying those values within that code block, and wish to output the modified values within that same block, you need to delay that expansion. This is done by enabling delayed expansion, using `SETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION` and using the delayed expansion variable syntax which replaces **`%`**&#39;s with **`!`**&#39;s.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n@ECHO OFF\r\nSETLOCAL DISABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION\r\n\r\nSET &quot;PROPERTIES_FILE=properties.txt&quot;\r\nSET &quot;PROPERTY_NAME=PROPERTY_NAME&quot;\r\nSET &quot;PROPERTY_VALUE=PROPERTY_NAME&quot;\r\n\r\nFOR /F &quot;USEBACKQ TOKENS=*&quot; %%L IN (&quot;%PROPERTIES_FILE%&quot;) DO (\r\n\tCALL :GET_PROPERTY_NAME %%L\r\n\tCALL :GET_PROPERTY_VALUE %%L\r\n\tSETLOCAL ENABLEDELAYEDEXPANSION\r\n\tECHO PROPERTY_NAME: !PROPERTY_NAME!

deeper (bolded) you can see that the class in question is provided by different version of &quot;cxf-rt-transports-http&quot;, namely separate jars for versions 3.1.4 and 3.1.12.\r\n\r\nYou will need to examine each conflict individually and remove the less desirable jar from the classpath.\r\n\r\nThe best way to do so is by creating an exclusion, such as:\r\n  \r\n    &lt;exclusions&gt;\r\n        &lt;exclusion&gt;  &lt;!-- declare the exclusion here --&gt;\r\n            &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.cxf&lt;/groupId&gt;\r\n            &lt;artifactId&gt;cxf-rt-transports-http&lt;/artifactId&gt;\r\n        &lt;/exclusion&gt;\r\n    &lt;/exclusions&gt; \r\n\r\nYou declare this on the dependency that depends on the above.\r\n\r\nWhich isn&#39;t always easy to figure out unless you have software that illustrates the dependency graph.\r\nIn Eclipse for example, the Maven POM editor can show you dependencies, conflicts, and generate exclusions for you.\r\n\r\n**Selection criteria:**\r\n\r\nIn most cases you&#39;ll probably want the newest version available, so in this case that&#39;s likely going to be 3.1.12.\r\nHowever, you may not want the latest, latest, but a particular stable version that you have extensively tested, yet which doesn&#39;t contain any vulnerabilities. So the answer to that isn&#39;t straight forward.\r\n\r\nIf you need a specific version, it may be best to declare an explicit dependency on that artifact in your own pom and exclude it from all others.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nAnother reason why you might need to choose a particular version over another is that you may be using another library that in turn relies on a specific version of a conflicting dependency, but has issues with a newer one.\r\n\r\nIn most cases version numbering is `&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;bugfix&gt;` and in almost all cases bugfix releases are binary compatible with each other, so in the case of cxf-rt-transports-http above you should be fine selecting 3.1.12.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, say you had dependencies A depending on C v1.5.0 and B depending on C v2.1.2. This would be more difficult due to possible incompatibility between those major versions. There may be a feature you need in v2, but A is not compatible as an important method that A relies on was removed.\r\n\r\nYou would then want to check whether a newer version of A exists that will work with C v2.1.X and replace that instead. If there isn&#39;t you might either need to downgrade B, or install them side by side. In an extreme case that may involve repackaging the product.\r\nAn alternative is to contribute to or fork project A to create a version with updated dependencies.\r\n\r\nMaybe it helps to think about the purpose of the warnings:\r\nThey&#39;re really saying that your code may run, but it is possible that a dependency version is selected in a non-deterministic fashion and that as a result some operations of your code might not to what you expect.\r\nWhat you want to do is make it deterministic by providing the JVM only one option to choose from in each case. You do that by making a conscious choice as a developer as to which version to use or depend on.\r\n\r\nIf you have no other reasons, then I&#39;d go for the latest/highest stable version, as that will probably include the most features and bugfixes.\r\nTest thoroughly, as you would, and on the off-chance that you have problems that are not caused by your own code, isolate and report a possible bug, downgrade if you need to until the bug is fixed, and/or contribute a fix yourself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955758/how-to-resolve-conflict-between-same-classes-coming-from-2-different-jar/57956536#57956536","title":"How to resolve conflict between same classes coming from 2 different jar?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12066528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCG35mDAB_dqabuPPavafLAit1ptloTeu-WRrpCdg=k-s128","display_name":"Nishtha garg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12066528/nishtha-garg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12066528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCG35mDAB_dqabuPPavafLAit1ptloTeu-WRrpCdg=k-s128","display_name":"Nishtha garg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12066528/nishtha-garg"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57956536,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568692309,"creation_date":1568632892,"last_edit_date":1568692309,"question_id":57955758,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955758","body_markdown":"I am in process of updating my project&#39;s jdk from 8 to 11 .

Then you use this vector to set the attribute by a simple lookup:\r\n\r\n    for (x in colnames(df)) attr(df[,x], &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- label_dictionary[x]\r\n\r\nThe loop iterates over all column names and sets the attribute.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955733/how-to-change-attributes-of-dataframe-columns-based-on-a-lookup-table/57955831#57955831","title":"How to change attributes of dataframe columns based on a lookup table"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":6105259,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df646e3f9a74241a666624aaa481f7ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Emman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6105259/emman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":68,"user_id":6105259,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df646e3f9a74241a666624aaa481f7ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Emman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6105259/emman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57955831,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568640258,"creation_date":1568632811,"last_edit_date":1568638083,"question_id":57955733,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57955733","body_markdown":"I have a data frame with lots of columns, and I want to edit columns&#39; attributes, so that each column attribute will be based of a matched value from a lookup table.\r\n\r\nDummy data\r\n----------\r\n```r\r\ndf &lt;- data.frame(id = c(1,2,3), age = c(10, 30, 55), eye_color = c(&quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;, &quot;green&quot;))\r\n\r\n&gt; df\r\n\r\n#   id age eye_color\r\n# 1  1  10      blue\r\n# 2  2  30     brown\r\n# 3  3  55     green\r\n```\r\nIf I just wanted to change the attribute of a single column `df$id`, I would do:\r\n```r\r\nattr(df$id, &quot;label&quot;) &lt;- &quot;Person&#39;s ID&quot;\r\n\r\n&gt; attr(df$id, &quot;label&quot;)\r\n# [1] &quot;Person&#39;s ID&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I need to edit the &quot;label&quot; attributes of all columns, and I want to be more efficient. So my hope is to rely on a separate table that matches column names and &quot;label&quot; attributes. (In reality, I&#39;d import a CSV file created manually outside of R, but for the sake of post reproducability, here&#39;s a dummy table that conveys my point. It could have been a data frame, as the object type doesn&#39;t matter):\r\n```r\r\nlabel_dictionary &lt;-\r\n  matrix(\r\n    c(\r\n      &quot;id&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Person&#39;s ID&quot;,\r\n      &quot;age&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Person&#39;s age when taking the survey&quot;,\r\n      &quot;eye_color&quot;,\r\n      &quot;Person&#39;s eye color&quot;\r\n    ),\r\n    ncol = 2,\r\n    byrow = TRUE\r\n  )\r\ncolnames(label_dictionary) &lt;- c(&quot;variable&quot;, &quot;label&quot;)\r\nlabel_dictionary &lt;- as.table(label_dictionary)\r\n\r\n&gt; label_dictionary\r\n\r\n#   variable  label                              \r\n# A id        Person&#39;s ID                        \r\n# B age       Person&#39;s age when taking the survey\r\n# C eye_color Person&#39;s eye color     \r\n```\r\n\r\nMy question\r\n-----------\r\nHow could I edit the *&quot;label&quot;* attributes of all columns in my dataframe `df`, based on matching values from the `label_dictionary` table? (Assuming the order of values in `label_dictionary$variable` **doesn&#39;t** necessarily match the order of `colnames(df)`).\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57955733/how-to-change-attributes-of-dataframe-columns-based-on-a-lookup-table","title":"How to change attributes of dataframe columns based on a lookup table"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":6993}
