You have a couple issues here. First, when you do `head = head-&gt;next` to go through your list, you are actively reassigning the head pointer and therefore loosing nodes from your list. You should make a temporary node, conventionally called `curr` for current. Then set `curr = head` and in the while loop do `curr = curr-&gt;next`\r\n\r\nThe other problem is that you delete a node in the middle of the list which effectively cuts your list into two pieces but don&#39;t put the two pieces back together. You&#39;ll need to make another temporary variable to point to the node you want to delete, `Book* deleteMe = curr-&gt;next`. Set `curr-&gt;next = curr-&gt;next-&gt;next` then `delete deleteMe` ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384365/how-do-i-delete-a-specific-node-in-a-linked-list/58384490#58384490","title":"How do I delete a specific node in a linked list"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"last_editor":{"reputation":367768,"user_id":65863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00013ceab8fb1928885c5c172fbfd4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remy Lebeau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/65863/remy-lebeau"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571091421,"last_edit_date":1571091421,"creation_date":1571089887,"answer_id":58384495,"question_id":58384365,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384495","body_markdown":"You are not updating the nodes that *surround* the node being deleted.

Once you provide necessary information like server name, path to your local `hostpath` and names for your SSL certificates it will be automatically created after one pod-run under specified `hostpath`:\r\n\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - name: certs\r\n        hostPath:\r\n          path: &quot;/home/&lt;someFolderLocation&gt;/certs-pv&quot;\r\n\r\n- those information should be re-used in the section Nginx reverse Proxy for `nginx.conf`\r\n\r\n**4.** In your nc-svc.yaml you can change the service type to the __type: NodePort__\r\n\r\n**5.** How to verify if your sercie is working properly:\r\n\r\n    kubectl get pods,svc,ep -o wide\r\n\r\n    Pods:\r\n    pod/nc-6d8694659d-5przx   1/1     Running     0          15m   10.244.0.6 \r\n    Svc: \r\n    service/svc-nc       NodePort    10.102.90.88   &lt;none&gt;        80:32500/TCP\r\n    Endpoints: \r\n    endpoints/svc-nc       10.244.0.6:80\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can test your service from inside the cluster running separate pod (f.e. ubuntu)\r\n\r\n    curl your_svc_name\r\nyou can verify if service discovery is working properly:\r\n\r\n    cat /etc/resolv.conf\r\n    nslokup svc_your_svc_name (your_svc_name.default.svc.cluster.local)\r\n\r\nFrom outside the cluster using NodePort:\r\n\r\n    curl NODE_IP:NODE_PORT ( if not please verify your firewall rules)\r\n    Once you provided hostname for your nextcloud service you should use\r\n    curl -vH &#39;Host:specified_hostname&#39; http://external_ip/ (using http or https according to your configuration)\r\n   \r\nIn addition you can exec directly into your db pod \r\n\r\n    kuebctl exec -it db_pod -- /bin/bash  and run \r\n\r\n    mysqladmin status -uroot -p$MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD\r\n    mysqlshow  -uroot -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --status nextcloud\r\n\r\n**6.** What should I do to have access to my nextcloud ?\r\nI didn&#39;t do the tuto part &quot;Create self-signed certificates&quot; because I don&#39;t know how to manage.\r\n\r\n**7.** As described under point 3. \r\n\r\n**8.** This part is not clear to me: `from another machine with nginx route a CNAME to the service`\r\n\r\nPlease refer to: \r\nAn [ExternalName Service][5] is a special case of Service that does not have selectors and uses DNS names instead.\r\n\r\nAdditional resources:\r\n\r\n- Expose your [Kubernetes service from your own custom domains][6] \r\n- What’s [the difference between a CNAME and a Web Redirect?][7] \r\n\r\nHope this help.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/nextcloud\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/andremotz/nextcloud-kubernetes\r\n  [3]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/notes/#deprecations-and-removals\r\n  [4]: https://hub.docker.com/r/paulczar/omgwtfssl/\r\n  [5]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#externalname\r\n  [6]: https://hackernoon.com/expose-your-kubernetes-service-from-your-own-custom-domains-cc8a1d965fc\r\n  [7]: https://totaluptime.com/kb/whats-the-difference-between-a-cname-and-a-web-redirect/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384354/error-when-access-to-nextcloud-in-kubernetes/58394630#58394630","title":"Error when access to Nextcloud in Kubernetes"}],"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":4181520,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a576c4220402e02125240dd59de1ed95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gobelet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4181520/gobelet"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2090,"user_id":3959259,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a71b31a7c2a883bebc3f8d2055f4386?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thomas Schremser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3959259/thomas-schremser"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571142255,"creation_date":1571088940,"last_edit_date":1571124240,"question_id":58384354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384354","body_markdown":"My goal is :\r\n\r\n - create a pod with Nextcloud\r\n - create a service to access this pod\r\n - from another machine with nginx route a CNAME to the service\r\n\r\nI tried to deploy a pod with Nextcloud and a service to access it but actually I can&#39;t access it.

I&#39;m trying to get working on the `create-react-app` front-end, but the behavior is incredibly slow and erratic.\r\n\r\n**Issues**\r\n\r\nThe main problems are the following:\r\n\r\n 1. It takes upwards of five minutes from running `skaffold dev --port-forward --tail` for it finally start spinning up. Running just a `docker build` takes less than 30 seconds.\r\n 2. When it finally starts spinning up, it just sits on `Starting the development server...` for another two minutes.\r\n 3. Then, nine times out of ten, I get the following errors after several minutes (there are three because that is how many replicas there are):\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    One out of ten times, it will actually go into the `Compiled Successfully! You can now view in the browser.` It never does launch in Chrome though.\r\n 4. Changes to JS in create-react-app are never reflected in new browser. You have to stop and run Skaffold again. Skaffold does say `Syncing 1 files for &lt;image&gt;... Watching for changes...`, but nothing changes even after a refresh.\r\n\r\n**What I&#39;ve tried**\r\n\r\n  1. I&#39;ve really simplified what I&#39;m trying to do to make it easier to sort this out, so I&#39;m using just an OOTB `create-react-app` application. The behavior is the same regardless.\r\n  2. `minikube delete` and `minikube start` several times (did this because even the server deployment started acting erratically after trying `create-react-app`)\r\n\r\n**Code and Steps to Reproduce**\r\n\r\nI&#39;m on macOS Mojave (10.14.6) using Docker for Mac, Kubernetes (v1.16.0), minikube (v1.4.0), Skaffold (v0.39.0), and `create-react-app`. I&#39;ll have to skip the installation process for all of these since it is fairly lengthy, so the following steps assume you have this already setup.\r\n\r\n 1. Make a project directory:\r\n\r\n    `mkdir project`\r\n\r\n 2. Make a Kubernetes manifest directory and move into it:\r\n\r\n    `mkdir k8s &amp;&amp; cd k8s`\r\n\r\n 3. Make a `client-deployment.yaml` and add the following:\r\n    ```\r\n    apiVersion: apps/v1\r\n    kind: Deployment\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: client-deployment\r\n    spec:\r\n      replicas: 3\r\n      selector:\r\n        matchLabels:\r\n          component: web\r\n      template:\r\n        metadata:\r\n          labels:\r\n            component: web\r\n        spec:\r\n          containers:\r\n            - name: client\r\n              image: testapp/client\r\n              ports:\r\n                - containerPort: 3000\r\n    ```\r\n 4. Make a `client-cluster-ip-service.yaml` and add the following:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    apiVersion: v1\r\n    kind: Service\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: client-cluster-ip-service\r\n    spec:\r\n      type: ClusterIP\r\n      selector:\r\n        component: web\r\n      ports:\r\n        - port: 3000\r\n          targetPort: 3000\r\n    ```\r\n 5. Move back into the parent:\r\n\r\n    `cd ..`\r\n\r\n 6. Create a `skaffold.yaml` and add the following:\r\n    ```\r\n    apiVersion: skaffold/v1beta15\r\n    kind: Config\r\n    build:\r\n      local:\r\n        push: false\r\n      artifacts:\r\n        - image: testapp/client\r\n          context: web\r\n          docker:\r\n            dockerfile: Dockerfile.dev\r\n          sync:\r\n            manual:\r\n              - src: &quot;**/*.js&quot;\r\n                dest: .\r\n              - src: &quot;**/*.html&quot;\r\n                dest: .\r\n              - src: &quot;**/*.css&quot;\r\n                dest: .\r\n    deploy:\r\n      kubectl:\r\n        manifests:\r\n          - k8s/client-deployment.yaml\r\n          - k8s/client-cluster-ip-service.yaml\r\n    portForward:\r\n      - resourceType: service\r\n        resourceName: client-cluster-ip-service\r\n        port: 3000\r\n        localPort: 3000\r\n    ```\r\n 7. Start a new `create-react-app` project:\r\n\r\n    `npx create-react-app test-app`\r\n\r\n 8. Change into the directory:\r\n\r\n    `cd test-app`\r\n\r\n 9. Create a `Dockerfile.dev` and add the following:\r\n    ```\r\n    FROM node:alpine\r\n    \r\n    WORKDIR &#39;/app&#39;\r\n    EXPOSE 3000\r\n    CMD [&quot;npm&quot;, &quot;run&quot;, &quot;start&quot;]\r\n    \r\n    COPY package* ./\r\n    RUN npm install\r\n    COPY . .\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n 10. Create a `.dockerignore` file and add the following:\r\n     ```\r\n     node_modules\r\n     *.swp\r\n     ```\r\n\r\n 11. Go back into the parent directory:\r\n\r\n     `cd ..`\r\n\r\n 12. Make sure `minikube` is running:\r\n\r\n     `minikube start`\r\n\r\n 13.

I am performing inference on a large data set using keras. The input that I am provided is a `Dataset` that returns &quot;minibatches&quot; of records. Since it is faster, I am combining numerous minibatches to call `predict_on_batch` on more records at a time. A simplified version of my code is as follows:\r\n\r\n    K.set_learning_phase(0)\r\n    batches_preds = []\r\n    minibatches = []\r\n\r\n    for i_minibatch,minibatch in enumerate(iter(my_dataset)):\r\n        minibatches.append(minibatch)\r\n        if (i_minibatch % minis_per_batch == 0):\r\n            batch = tf.concat(minibatches, 0)\r\n            batch_preds = model.predict_on_batch(batch).numpy().flatten()\r\n            batches_preds.append(batch_preds)\r\n            minibatches = []\r\n\r\n    if len(minibatches) &gt; 0:\r\n        batch = tf.concat(minibatches, 0)\r\n        batch_preds = model.predict_on_batch(batch).numpy().flatten()\r\n        batches_preds.append(batch_preds)\r\n        \r\n    preds = np.hstack(batches_preds)\r\n\r\nI am trying to improve the performance of this process. Interestingly, if I `time` the various steps, the step where I reinitialize `minibatches` to an empty list takes a large percentage of the time. I assume that the actual work done by TensorFlow in this step is some combination of ensuring that the no-longer-referenced `Tensor`s are safe to deallocate, and then deallocating them.\r\n\r\nI have two questions about this behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Is deallocating `Tensor`s inherently expensive?  Why should it take so much time?\r\n2. In TensorFlow 2.0, is there any way that I can deallocate a `Tensor` manually so that I can analyze the performance of the operation and possibly skip unnecessary safety checks?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384310/tensorflow-2-0-deallocation-performance","title":"TensorFlow 2.0 - Deallocation Performance"},{"tags":["wxpython","pdf-viewer"],"owner":{"reputation":2174,"user_id":6411000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nR4OG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fejs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6411000/fejs"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571088663,"creation_date":1571088663,"question_id":58384308,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384308","body_markdown":"I am using wxPython&#39;s pdfViewer class to load PDF file.

sounds like you&#39;re describing a background task that you want to launch.

Dao methods returning `Flow&lt;T&gt;`: \r\n\r\n        @Query(&quot;SELECT * FROM table WHERE id = :id&quot;)\r\n        fun itemById(id: Int): Flow&lt;Item&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n 2. Repository layer returning items from DB but also backfilling from network:\r\n\r\n  (* Need help here -- this is not working as intended **)\r\n\r\n\r\n        fun items(): Flow&lt;Item&gt; = flow {\r\n            // Immediately emit values from DB\r\n            emitAll(itemDao.itemById(1))\r\n\r\n            // Backfill DB via network request without blocking coroutine\r\n            itemApi.makeRequest()\r\n                .also { insert(it) }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n 3. ViewModel layer taking the flow, applying any transformations, and converting it into a LiveData using .asLiveData():\r\n\r\n\r\n        fun observeItem(): LiveData&lt;Item&gt; = itemRepository.getItemFlow()\r\n            .map { // apply transformation to view model }\r\n            .asLiveData()\r\n\r\n 4. Fragment observing LiveData emissions and updating UI: \r\n\r\n        viewModel.item().observeNotNull(viewLifecycleOwner) {\r\n            renderUI(it)\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe issue I&#39;m having is at step 2. I can&#39;t seem to figure out a way to structure the logic so that I can emit the items from Flow immediately, but also perform the network fetch without waiting. \r\n\r\nSince the fetch from network logic is in the same suspend function it&#39;ll wait for the network request to finish before emitting the results downstream. But I just want to fire that request independently since I&#39;m not interested in waiting for a result (when it comes back, it&#39;ll update Room and I&#39;ll get the results naturally).\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nMarko&#39;s solution works well for me, but I did attempt a similar approach like so:\r\n\r\n\r\n    suspend fun items(): Flow&lt;List&lt;Cryptocurrency&gt;&gt; = coroutineScope {\r\n        launch {\r\n            itemApi.makeRequest().also { insert(it) }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        itemDao.itemById(1)\r\n

For instance if you put a string in the above code with `&quot;elifant&quot;` it will write `&quot;else ifant&quot;`. \r\n\r\n---\r\nConclusion\r\n---\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve stressed this enough, haha, but seriously **do *NOT* use this in Production**. :) \r\n\r\nIn any case I hope this trick helped answer your question! **Happy Coding!**\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384299/how-do-i-re-assign-the-else-if-in-javascript-to-function-the-same-but-typed-as-e/58384478#58384478","title":"How do I re-assign the else if in javascript to function the same but typed as elif?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12093066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2IDkY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chgearft","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12093066/chgearft"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58384478,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571090227,"creation_date":1571088608,"question_id":58384299,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384299","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently doing some JavaScript programming and don&#39;t like having to type **else if** everytime I need to use it. I would much rather just type **elif**. I have done tons of research and don&#39;t know how I could get something like this... _look at code_ ... to work where I can still say elif, but it is recognized as else if and I would be able to use it without the program.\r\n\r\n```\r\nelif = else if;\r\nlet x = 20;\r\nif (x &gt;= 21) {\r\n  console.log(&#39;psych bwah!&#39;);\r\n} elif (x &lt;= 19 ) {\r\n  console.log(&#39;umm... nope try again bud!&#39;);\r\n} else {\r\n  console.log(&#39;ladies and gentlemen we gotem!&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI really want this to work so badly. And it would be so mind pleasing to understand how to rewrite pre-made code in terms that I want to use. Another example of what I&#39;m trying to accomplish would be re-assigning the `console.log()` printing function to something shorter but still does the exact same thing, maybe `c.l()` as a shorter version, just for example though.\r\n\r\nHaving the ability to assign already usable normal JavaScript code to my own version of code is the task I guess I am trying to accomplish, if that makes sense. This way I can shorthand it and make everything way faster than I&#39;d be able to before. So what I am really looking for is a better/working way, because my current method seen above in the code doesn&#39;t work, is maybe some form of a method or other way of changing the name of an if...else keeping the same function just typed/said different in code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384299/how-do-i-re-assign-the-else-if-in-javascript-to-function-the-same-but-typed-as-e","title":"How do I re-assign the else if in javascript to function the same but typed as elif?"},{"tags":["swiftui"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":390,"user_id":3308103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hvNGQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gujci","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3308103/gujci"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571092346,"post_id":58384298,"comment_id":103117558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384298/swiftui-unknown-attribute-observable-object#comment103117558_58384298"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1578,"user_id":5140471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db4aee540fe38f3f025abda3fc6c80c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RPatel99","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5140471/rpatel99"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1578,"user_id":5140471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db4aee540fe38f3f025abda3fc6c80c5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RPatel99","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5140471/rpatel99"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571170797,"last_edit_date":1571170797,"creation_date":1571105745,"answer_id":58386313,"question_id":58384298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386313","body_markdown":"`ObservableObject` is a protocol that `ObservedObject`s must conform to.

have a very large dataset in CSV format (500K+ lines and 6500+ columns), which looks something like this (everything is integer valued, followed by cast to float64 during the batch import loop):\r\n\r\n```\r\n1,7930472962,92,5,2,9471037239,67,2,1...8371097814,81,2,3\r\n2,2091185638,92,5,2,3773622239,67,2,1...8378747918,81,2,3\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo based on the length of the lines I can&#39;t fit everything into memory, I am streaming everything from CSV like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntrain_dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(\r\n    sys.argv[1],\r\n    batch_size = BATCHSIZE,\r\n    column_names = SELECT_COLUMNS,\r\n    column_defaults = DEFAULTS,\r\n    label_name = LABEL_COLUMN,\r\n    field_delim=&#39;,&#39;,\r\n    use_quote_delim=True,\r\n    na_value=&#39;&#39;,\r\n    header=False,\r\n    num_epochs=1,\r\n    shuffle=True,\r\n    shuffle_buffer_size=500,\r\n    shuffle_seed=None,\r\n    num_parallel_reads=1,\r\n    sloppy=False,\r\n    num_rows_for_inference=1000,\r\n    compression_type=None,\r\n    ignore_errors=False\r\n)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI end up with a dict that I can then pull numpy arrays from in this fashion:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor batch, label in train_dataset:\r\n    for key, value in batch.items():\r\n       print(value.numpy())\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem is, with each batch the Numpy arrays are grouping together everything by column whereas I need to have each CSV line from the batch converted into an ndarray, basically multiple nested ndarrays from the batch within an ndarray so that I can do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = loader.load_data()\r\ntrain_dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(x_train)\r\ntrain_dataset = train_dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=train_buf)\r\ntrain_dataset = train_dataset.batch(batch_size)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am having a difficult time understanding the transition to 2.0 espe, followed by the shuffle operation?cially insofar as tf.data is concerned. I think I need to pack each CSV line into tensor slices first, followed by then creating the dataset with tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices()?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384267/best-way-of-constructing-batched-numpy-array-from-csv-values","title":"Best way of constructing batched Numpy array from CSV values?"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","activerecord","associations"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":7254473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fkwvm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonny B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7254473/jonny-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571145526,"post_id":58384583,"comment_id":103136879,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384264/has-one-association-not-adding-methods-to-belongs-to-class/58384583#comment103136879_58384583"},{"owner":{"reputation":1187,"user_id":9785060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUduC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Viktor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9785060/viktor"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":88,"user_id":7254473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fkwvm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonny B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7254473/jonny-b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571146249,"post_id":58384583,"comment_id":103137331,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384264/has-one-association-not-adding-methods-to-belongs-to-class/58384583#comment103137331_58384583"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1187,"user_id":9785060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUduC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Viktor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9785060/viktor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1187,"user_id":9785060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUduC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Viktor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9785060/viktor"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571091356,"last_edit_date":1571091356,"creation_date":1571090534,"answer_id":58384583,"question_id":58384264,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384583","body_markdown":"What you want is:\r\n\r\n    UserToken.where(user_id: 1).first.user\r\n\r\nor better yet:\r\n\r\n    UserToken.find_by(user_id: 1).user\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re getting the &quot;undefined method&quot; error because `#where` returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation` and an ActiveRecord Relation has no `#user` method.\r\n\r\n    UserToken.where(user_id: 1).class.name\r\n    #=&gt; &quot;ActiveRecord::Relation&quot;\r\n    UserToken.where(user_id: 1).first.class.name\r\n    #=&gt; &quot;UserToken&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384264/has-one-association-not-adding-methods-to-belongs-to-class/58384583#58384583","title":"has_one association not adding methods to belongs_to class"}],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":7254473,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fkwvm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonny B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7254473/jonny-b"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1187,"user_id":9785060,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IUduC.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Viktor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9785060/viktor"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58384583,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571105955,"creation_date":1571088452,"last_edit_date":1571105955,"question_id":58384264,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384264","body_markdown":"I have two tables User and UserToken.

But I was then recommended to install nginx onto the server.\r\n\r\nNginx is new to me, I&#39;ve installed it and it seems to be running correctly and the domains are hitting the webserver but when nginx is started the external domains no longer resolve to the appropriate directories. I assume nginx is overriding the settings of MaraDNS and that I need to setup the mapping to directories again within the nginx environment but can&#39;t find clear instructions for this - and the only clear instructions are for setups using `sites-available` which isn&#39;t part of the CentOS7 install.\r\n\r\nWhen nginx is enabled I get a &quot;404 Not Found&quot;

Int\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a kind of super struct above:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct WholeResponse: Codable {\r\n    let data: [Fruit]\r\n    let someStuff: [Int?]\r\n    let someOtherStuff: [Int?]\r\n\r\n    enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {\r\n        case data\r\n        case someStuff = &quot;some_stuff&quot;\r\n        case someOtherStuff = &quot;some_other_stuff&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct Fruit: Codable {\r\n        let name: String\r\n        let price: Int\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {\r\n        let container = try decoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)\r\n        let data = try container.nestedContainer(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self, forKey: .data)\r\n        name = try data.decode(String.self, forKey: .name)\r\n        price = try data.decode(Int.self, forKey: .price)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {\r\n        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)\r\n        var data = container.nestedContainer(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self, forKey: .data)\r\n        try data.encode(name, forKey: .name)\r\n        try data.encode(price, forKey: .price)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut I found myself pretty stuck after doing this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet jsonData = jsonString.data(using: .utf8)!\r\nlet jsonDecoder = JSONDecoder()\r\n\r\nlet fruits = try jsonDecoder.decode(WholeResponse.self, from: jsonData)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think I am missing something about the representation of my data and perhaps complicating the thing but can you help me get this data array parsed?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384245/decoding-this-kind-of-json-with-codable","title":"Decoding this kind of JSON with

Although I understand there are similar tools for other build chains.\r\n\r\nAs far as &quot;best practices&quot;, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything particularly different than any other JVM Docker images. e.g.:\r\n\r\n* One process per container. So, no, you don&#39;t put a cluster per container: you put one node per container: that way you can scale up and scale down just by adding/removing containers. (And do rolling upgrades, etc.)\r\n* [Don&#39;t use CPU limits][2]\r\n* Be aware that the JVM (especially Java8) may report all of the CPUs &amp; memory on the host, so you may want to manually set your thread and memory settings or look into the JVM flags that can alleviate this such as `-XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+UseCGroupMemoryLimitForHeap `\r\n* Minimum privilege etc. SBT Native Packager has reasonable defaults for this this, but normal advice about using a suitable base image and other general Dockerfile advice applies.\r\n\r\nThere are also, of course, [the actual Akka docs][3] deploying to Docker as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing that you may find helpful is the [Lightbend article on running Lagom on Kubernetes][4]. Since it&#39;s Lagom (rather than just Akka) and Kubernetes (rather than just containers) it will be a superset of things you care about. (For example, you won&#39;t care about the Postgres/Kafka setup.)

So, you can&#39;t have the call to `sequence` outside of your call to `count`. One obvious thing you could try would be a partial reimplementation of `sequence` inside of `count` itself:\r\n\r\n    count :: (Num a, Ord a, Monad m) =&gt; [m a] -&gt; m (Maybe Int)\r\n    count = go 0 0\r\n      where go n total [] = pure Nothing\r\n            go n total (x:xs) = do\r\n              num &lt;- x\r\n              let total&#39; = total + num\r\n                  n&#39; = succ n\r\n              if total&#39; &gt;= 1\r\n                then pure $ Just n&#39;\r\n                else go n&#39; total&#39; xs\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also amended the result to return a Maybe, because it seems wrong to return 1 for an empty list (as yours did), or return the length of a list even if its elements sum to something less than 1.\r\n\r\nAnother reasonable change would be to not accept `[m a]`, but just a single `m a`, which can reliably produce a value any number of times. Then we don&#39;t have to worry about the input running out, and so no Maybe is needed:\r\n\r\n    count :: (Num a, Ord a, Monad m) =&gt; m a -&gt; m Int\r\n    count m = go 0 0\r\n      where go n total = do\r\n              num &lt;- m\r\n              let total&#39; = total + num\r\n                  n&#39; = succ n\r\n              if total&#39; &gt;= 1\r\n                then pure n&#39;\r\n                else go n&#39; total&#39;\r\n\r\nThen you can simply call `count $ randomRIO (0::Double, 1)`, and it will produce as many random numbers as are needed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384217/trim-an-infinite-list-of-random-numbers/58384735#58384735","title":"Trim an infinite list of random numbers"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":20027,"user_id":7203016,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ybAMw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"K.

website was working fine for weeks, I made no changes to the code/server and today I noticed that I am getting `HTTP ERROR 500` and occasionally `Allowed memory size of 134217728 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 31424352 bytes)` on one of the pages on my website with the following controller code:\r\n\r\n    $builds = Cache::remember(\r\n    &#39;All.builds.page.&#39; . $currentPage . &quot;.by.&quot; . $sortBy,\r\n    now()-&gt;addSeconds(30),\r\n    function () use ($sortBy) {\r\n        if ($sortBy == &#39;top&#39;) {\r\n            return Build::where(&#39;private&#39;,

  });\r\n\r\nThis happens when `$sortBy` is set to `top` and when the object has been cached. For example, if I visit the page for the first time it will return the top rated builds. If I refresh the page, I will see the error. I have to wait 30 seconds for the cache to expire or manually clear the cache for the page to work again.\r\n\r\nThe website has handled 10 times the traffic it is having right now without any issues and now all of a sudden it&#39;s not working.

`else if` is not a language feature - it&#39;s just a different use of whitespace between the statements.\r\n\r\n`else`, `if`, `(condition)`, and `action();` can be written on one, two, three or four lines;  it&#39;s just easier to read and takes up less vertical space to put them all on one or two lines.\r\n\r\nIndentation is also optional, but I included it for readablility.

statements are flexible in their acceptable syntax. In languages like C#, the code to execute can be on the same line as the condition check or on a new line, indented or not, within braces or not. This flexibility raises the question of whether the `else if` block is an actual language construct at all, or merely a result of just how flexible `if/else` statements are.\r\n\r\nConsider this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Version 1\r\nif (condition1)\r\n  // do something\r\nelse if (condition2)\r\n  // do something else\r\nelse\r\n  // do some third thing\r\n```\r\nThis code can be rewritten in a way that is syntactically different but semantically identical:\r\n```\r\n// Version 2\r\nif (condition1)\r\n  // do something\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n  if (condition2)\r\n    // do something else\r\n  else\r\n    // do some third thing\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe braces surrounding the `else` block are optional because `if/else` is considered a single statement for brace-usage purposes, so yet another semantically identical iteration would be:\r\n```\r\n// Version 3\r\nif (condition1)\r\n  // do something\r\nelse\r\n  if (condition2)\r\n    // do something else\r\n  else\r\n    // do some third thing\r\n```\r\nThere is, of course, no discernible difference between Version 1 and Version 3 because C# doesn&#39;t respect whitespace. The natural question, then, is whether `else if` is an actual feature built into C# (or C-family languages in general), or simply a useful consequence of flexible syntax that clever software developers discovered long ago.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried writing programs to test this behavior and try to tease out the underlying behavior, but I haven&#39;t been able to write a program that can successfully differentiate between the two syntaxes.

Consider the collection `arrays`. It has a field called `arr` which is *an array of embedded documents* (with fields `a` and `b`).\r\n\r\nSome documents in the `arrays` collection:\r\n\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 1, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b2&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 2, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b11&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b22&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 3, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 4, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b91&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a29&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; } ] }\r\n\r\nI want to find all documents with the array embedded-document fields `a=&quot;a1&quot;` AND `b=&quot;b1&quot;`. Note this must be within the same element embedded-document of the array. I use **$elemMatch** for this and get the desired result.\r\n\r\n    &gt; db.arrays.find( { arr: { $elemMatch: { a: &quot;a1&quot;, b: &quot;b1&quot; } } } )\r\n    ==&gt;\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 1, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b2&quot; } ] }\r\n\r\nNow, if I use the **$and** operator like in the following query, the results are not correct. As you can see an additional document is selected. The query worked with the array embedded-document fields `a=&quot;a1&quot;` OR `b=&quot;b1&quot;`. \r\n\r\n    &gt; db.arrays.find({$and: [ { &quot;arr.a&quot;: &quot;a1&quot; }, { &quot;arr.b&quot;: &quot;b1&quot; } ] } )\r\n    ==&gt;\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 1, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b2&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 4, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b91&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a29&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; } ] }\r\n\r\nSo, using the `$and` operator is NOT intended for this purpose (i.e., querying on multiple fields of an array of sub-documents). \r\n\r\nAlso, to query on an array embedded-document field (**only one field**) the `$elemMatch` is not required, for example:\r\n\r\n    &gt; db.arrays.find( { &quot;arr.a&quot;: &quot;a2&quot; } )\r\n    ==&gt;\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 1, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b2&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 2, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a1&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b11&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b22&quot; } ] }\r\n    { &quot;_id&quot; : 3, &quot;arr&quot; : [ { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a2&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; }, { &quot;a&quot; : &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; : &quot;b1&quot; } ]

So one employee can have multiple timeoffs.\r\n\r\n\tTimeOffs \r\n\r\n\ttimeoff1 {status:PENDING, employee: 1}\r\n\ttimeoff2 {status:PENDING, employee: 2}\r\n\ttimeoff3 {status:PENDING, employee: 3}\r\n\ttimeoff1 {status:APPROVED, employee: 1}\r\n\ttimeoff5 {status:PENDING, employee: 2}\r\n\ttimeoff3 {status:APPROVED, employee: 3}\r\n\ttimeoff6 {status:PENDING, employee: 1}\r\n\ttimeoff7 {status:PENDING, employee: 1}\r\n\ttimeoff8 {status:PENDING, employee: 2}\r\n\r\nI want result as shown below, so that employee can have only his pending time offs:\r\n\r\n\temployee1: [timeoff6, timeoff7] //as timeoff1 is already approved so don&#39;t need this now.\r\n\temployee2: [timeoff2, timeoff5, timeoff8] //as all timeoffs for employee2 are pending\r\n\temployee3: [] //No pending timeoffs\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I go for that. I started doing this something like below code but I don&#39;t know am I doing it in a right way or not.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t need code but just suggest me correct/good approach of doing this through kafka streams DSL. Thank you.\r\nIn below example, I am streaming topic, and grouping timeoffs by employeeId. But in that case how do I get updated status of timeoff. I am confused. Can anyone help.\r\n\r\n\tKStream&lt;String, TimeOff&gt; source = builder.stream(topic);\r\n\tKTable&lt;String, ArrayList&lt;TimeOff&gt;&gt; newStore = source.groupBy((k, v) -&gt; v.getEmployeeId())\r\n\t        .aggregate(ArrayList::new,\r\n\t                (key, value, aggregate) -&gt; {\r\n\t                    aggregate.add(value);\r\n\t                    return aggregate;\r\n\t                }, Materialized.&lt;String, ArrayList&lt;TimeOff&gt;, KeyValueStore&lt;Bytes, byte[]&gt;&gt;as(&quot;NewStore&quot;).withValueSerde(new TimeOffListSerde(new TimeOffSerde())));\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384198/how-to-determine-session-finished-in-kafka-streams","title":"How to determine session finished in kafka streams"},{"tags":["c#","jquery","asp.net-mvc","kendo-datepicker"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":11286167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3293ee126c8977237610d47cfa13d74?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mostafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11286167/mostafa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571122653,"creation_date":1571122653,"answer_id":58388877,"question_id":58384196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58388877","body_markdown":"I solved this problem by below jquery code:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n        var pastDate = new Date(1991, 2, 21);\r\n        $(document).ready(function () {\r\n            $(&quot;#BirthDate&quot;).kendoDatePicker({\r\n                value: pastDate,\r\n                min: pastDate\r\n            }).val(&#39;&#39;).data(&quot;kendoDatePicker&quot;);\r\n        });\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384196/how-make-kendodatepicker-to-show-special-datetime-in-its-dropdown/58388877#58388877","title":"How make kendoDatePicker to show special datetime in its dropdown"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":11286167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3293ee126c8977237610d47cfa13d74?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mostafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11286167/mostafa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571122653,"creation_date":1571087947,"question_id":58384196,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384196","body_markdown":"I used KendoDatePicker in my ASP.NET MVC to have Persian(Shamsi) calendar in my project and today is 1398/07/23 and as you see in below picture this datepicker has shown excactly the true date for today.\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/lncpN.png\r\n\r\nBut something that I need is that when we open its dropdown for the first time then this datepicker must show us a date from 18 years ago(1370/01/01) in the dropdown.

got an ApolloServer project that&#39;s giving me trouble, so I thought I might update it and ran into issues when using the latest Babel.

First I tried doing things to convince TPTB* that this was a module (with no success). So I changed the &quot;import&quot; to a &quot;require&quot; and this worked.\r\n\r\nBut now I have about two dozen &quot;imports&quot; in other files giving me the same error.\r\n\r\n*I&#39;m sure the root of my problem is that I&#39;m not even sure what&#39;s complaining about the issue.

First you created a KeyTable object with your array. Then you ran a bunch of other random stuff (buildfromString method). Then you ask it to return an empty key and print it. I have no clue what you are actually trying to do but it definitely won&#39;t print anything because you didn&#39;t store it anywhere. You also have it returning an empty object which makes no sense either. Something like this:\r\n\r\n    key=KeyTable.buildFromString(&quot;Example&quot;);\r\n\r\nYou then can return you results in your main application to display the information properly. I hope that this helps you. If you provide more details on what you are actually trying to do, I can help more on that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384175/using-static-methods/58384487#58384487","title":"Using static methods"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12161589,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/79602c86a440409e853429253ea664d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dafeon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161589/dafeon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2622,"user_id":356629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f563718f19b5aab648973d6e38a9d8af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kenny_k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/356629/kenny-k"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571093090,"creation_date":1571087798,"last_edit_date":1571089990,"question_id":58384175,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58384175","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to build a matrix with a static method and I return a new constructor with the built matrix, but whenever I try to get the matrix values, it all ends up being empty.\r\n\r\n    public class KeyTable {\r\n    \r\n        private char[][] key;\r\n        final static int rows = 5;\r\n        final static int columns = 5;\r\n    \r\n        public KeyTable(char[][] key) {\r\n            this.key = key;\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n        public static KeyTable buildFromString(String keyPhrase)\r\n        {\r\n            char[][] alpha = new char[5][5];\r\n            char[] alphabet = &quot;abcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxyz&quot;.toCharArray();\r\n            int followingAlphabet = 0;\r\n            for(int r = 0; r &lt; rows; r++)\r\n            {\r\n                for(int c = 0; c &lt; columns; c++)\r\n                {\r\n                    if(followingAlphabet &lt;= keyPhrase.length()-1)\r\n                        alpha[r][c] = keyPhrase.charAt(followingAlphabet);\r\n                    else\r\n                        alpha[r][c] = alphabet[followingAlphabet];\r\n                    followingAlphabet++;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(alpha));\r\n            return new KeyTable(alpha);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public char[][] getKeyTable()\r\n        {\r\n            return this.key;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMain class:\r\n\r\n    package com.company;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    import java.util.Arrays;\r\n    \r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            char[][] alpha = new char[5][5];\r\n            KeyTable key = new KeyTable(alpha);\r\n            System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(alpha));\r\n            KeyTable.buildFromString(&quot;EXAMPLE&quot;);\r\n            key.getKeyTable();\r\n            System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(alpha));\r\n            System.out.println(Arrays.deepToString(key.getKeyTable()));\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58384175/using-static-methods","title":"Using static methods"},{"tags":["java","recursion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":891,"user_id":10496710,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5cb3d11da053d8e1e94ef99a27ca6af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"B.

You define a destructor but you don&#39;t define a copy constructor or copy assignment operator.\r\n\r\nThis means that making a copy of a `DList` at all (which calling `DList::push_front(DList&lt;T&gt;)` almost certainly will) will cause a use-after-free in the destructor.\r\n\r\nRemember that compiler-generated copy constructors and copy assignment operators simply perform a memberwise copy of values.  In this case, your values are pointers.  Therefore, a copy of a `DList` object will simply copy the original pointers to the new object.\r\n\r\nWhen one of those objects is destructed, the list will be torn down, however _the other object will still be holding pointers to the memory allocations that were freed._\r\n\r\nYou _must_ implement the copy constructor and copy assignment operator if you wish your type to be copyable, because the compiler-generated versions will do the wrong thing. If you are using C++11, you should also define the move constructor and move assignment operator.\r\n\r\nIn C++11, you could also delete these constructors and operators and then you&#39;ll get a compile-time error everywhere that you attempt to make a copy:\r\n\r\n    DList(DList const &amp;) = delete;\r\n    DList(DList &amp;&amp;) = delete;\r\n\r\n    DList &amp; operator=(DList const &amp;) = delete;\r\n    DList &amp; operator=(DList &amp;&amp;) = delete;\r\n\r\nWithout the definition of the `Node` template class I cannot suggest an implementation of the copy constructor or copy assignment operator. However, I _can_ suggest an implementation for the move variants:\r\n\r\n    void swap(DList &amp; other) {\r\n        std::swap(head, other.head);\r\n        std::swap(tail, other.tail);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    DList(DList &amp;&amp; other) : head(nullptr), tail(nullptr) {\r\n        swap(other);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    DList &amp; operator=(DList &amp;&amp; other) {\r\n        swap(other);\r\n        return *this;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnother error:\r\n\r\n    void push_front(DList&lt;T&gt; newList)\r\n\r\nShould be:\r\n\r\n    void push_front(DList&lt;T&gt; &amp; newList)\r\n\r\nBecause you modify the &quot;new list&quot; -- it doesn&#39;t make much sense to modify a copy.  However, the semantic meaning of this doesn&#39;t match `push_front(T)`!\r\n\r\nThe single-value overload takes a value and pushes it onto _this_ list.\r\n\r\nThe list overload takes another list and pushes _this_ list onto the _other_ list.

I have tried to reproduce what I think you need into a simple example\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say we have this command\r\n```php\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace App\\Console\\Commands;\r\n\r\nuse

}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe import method throws an exception but here&#39;s how to mock it to return true\r\n\r\n```php\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace Tests\\Feature;\r\n\r\nuse Tests\\TestCase;\r\nuse App\\Console\\Commands\\Foo;\r\n\r\nclass FooCommandTest extends TestCase\r\n{\r\n    public function testExample()\r\n    {\r\n        $mock =
