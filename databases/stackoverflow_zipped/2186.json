It is listed in [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.windows.controls.label?view=netframework-4.8#properties) and it is displayed at the top of the Properties window.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAs for setting a property in code, if you had looked at your existing WinForms project properly then you would have seen that you did not do this:\r\n\r\n    MyLabel.Text(newText)\r\n\r\nbut rather this:\r\n\r\n    MyLabel.Content = newText\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s how you would have set any property at all in your WinForms app and that&#39;s how you set any property at all in any type of app.  The fact that this is a WPF app has exactly zero bearing on how you set a property.\r\n\r\nSo, as I have already said several times, the solution to your problem is to set a `Name` for your `Label` and then set the appropriate property in code rather than trying to call it as a method.  You already know what the appropriate property is because you already put it in your question, i.e. `Content`.  Like I said, you already had ALL the information you needed but you were simply determined not to use it.

My most recent attempt was as follows:\r\n\r\n    #After setting working directory to the folder with all .bil files\r\n    \r\n    library(prism)\r\n    library(raster)\r\n    library(sp)\r\n    \r\n    type = &quot;ppt&quot;\r\n    ls_prism_data(name=TRUE) #lists PRISM files\r\n    \r\n    j = 1\r\n    k = 18\r\n    final_df = NULL\r\n    filepre = paste(&quot;PRISM_&quot;, type , &quot;_stable_4kmD2_&quot;, sep = &quot;&quot;)\r\n    for (i in 1:771) {\r\n      RS1 &lt;- prism_stack(ls_prism_data()[j:k, 1])\r\n      l = 18\r\n      if (i = 771) {\r\n        l = 17                # 770*18 + 17 = 13877\r\n      }\r\n      j = j + l\r\n      k = k + l\r\n      pr_df &lt;- data.frame(rasterToPoints(RS1))\r\n      long_pr_df &lt;- pr_df %&gt;% gather(Date, type, -x, -y)\r\n      long_pr_df$Dates &lt;- gsub(filepre, &quot;&quot;, long_pr_df$Dates)\r\n      long_pr_df$Dates &lt;- gsub(&quot;_bil&quot;, &quot;&quot;, long_pr_df$Dates)\r\n      final_df &lt;- rbind(final_df, long_pr_df)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy thinking was to convert the data in &quot;batches.&quot; Unfortunately, this results in a fatal error that causes R to abort.\r\n\r\nUltimately I would like to get the information to a single file organized by year, by point with column variable denoting precipitation so I can continue this for other climate variables.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t need a correction to the above code per se, I&#39;m just looking for a means to an end.

It&#39;s as if past special keep text only doesnt work when it&#39;s a range of cells?\r\n\r\nThank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020598/vba-to-copy-a-range-from-xl-and-paste-keep-text-only-in-ppt","title":"VBA to copy a range from XL and paste &quot;Keep Text Only&quot; in PPT"},{"tags":["angular","angular-material","angular-forms","angular-formbuilder"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":463,"user_id":11801537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uLEl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ng-suhas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11801537/ng-suhas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569221422,"post_id":58020597,"comment_id":102511248,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020597/how-can-i-set-the-validators-of-an-angular-form-and-if-it-already-has-invalid-va#comment102511248_58020597"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":5911938,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/babaf92dbab16fa4e56b587f845cf3e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sagar Khatri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5911938/sagar-khatri"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569924915,"post_id":58022694,"comment_id":102745058,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020597/how-can-i-set-the-validators-of-an-angular-form-and-if-it-already-has-invalid-va/58022694#comment102745058_58022694"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":5911938,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/babaf92dbab16fa4e56b587f845cf3e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sagar Khatri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5911938/sagar-khatri"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2189,"user_id":9764133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcf47.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ganesh045","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9764133/ganesh045"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568960456,"last_edit_date":1568960456,"creation_date":1568959983,"answer_id":58022694,"question_id":58020597,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022694","body_markdown":"     if (this.becaForm.controls.get(&#39;cantidad&#39;).value.indexOf(&#39;%&#39;) != -1) {\r\n          if (Number(this.becaForm.controls.get(&#39;cantidad&#39;).value) &gt; 100) {\r\n              this.becaForm.controls[&quot;cantidad&quot;].setErrors({ &#39;incorrect&#39;: true });\r\n              this.becaForm.controls[&quot;cantidad&quot;].updateValueAndValidity();\r\n          } else {\r\n              //some logic here\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nPlease provide stackblitz next time for reproduction of the issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020597/how-can-i-set-the-validators-of-an-angular-form-and-if-it-already-has-invalid-va/58022694#58022694","title":"How can I set the validators of an angular form and if it already has invalid values ​the error is detected"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10463789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MDDqSpAcRAc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7pB7chBxZFtfKThzKEZonqSEk3F8A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristian Sotomayor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10463789/cristian-sotomayor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10463789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-MDDqSpAcRAc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAnnY7pB7chBxZFtfKThzKEZonqSEk3F8A/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Cristian Sotomayor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10463789/cristian-sotomayor"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569015009,"creation_date":1568942289,"last_edit_date":1569015009,"question_id":58020597,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020597","body_markdown":"Here i left the example with stackblitz\r\n\r\nhttps://change-validation-form.stackblitz.io\r\n\r\n\r\nI am experimenting with forms and I need them to change their validation depending on a value that was assigned to a combo. e.g. It is the discount of a scholarship.

[`TEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG`](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/master/docs/test-cases-and-sections.md#signature-based-parametrised-test-cases) to compile the same test case for different specializations. You could express the similarities between specializations using &quot;actual code&quot; instead of traits.\r\n\r\nIt might look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTEMPLATE_TEST_CASE_SIG(\r\n  &quot;MyClass specialization compat&quot;, \r\n  &quot;[myclass]&quot;, \r\n  ((typename T, bool isZero), T, isZero),\r\n  (int, false), (int, true)\r\n) {\r\n  const MyClass&lt;T, isZero&gt; mc{T{}};\r\n  T val{mc.GetValue()};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that `GetValue` exists, is marked `const` and returns something that can be narrowed to `T`. You don&#39;t have to use a unit testing framework. You can just use a function template. You don&#39;t need to actually run the tests. You just need to compile them.\r\n\r\n```\r\ntemplate &lt;typename T, bool isZero&gt;\r\nvoid test() {\r\n  const MyClass&lt;T, isZero&gt; mc{T{}};\r\n  T val = mc.GetValue();\r\n}\r\n\r\ninline void runTests() {\r\n  test&lt;int, false&gt;();\r\n  test&lt;int, true&gt;();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to be more thorough, you end up with the same tedium as in Nicholas&#39;s answer.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020566/how-to-guarantee-consistent-interfaces-between-c-template-class-specialization/58021604#58021604","title":"How to guarantee consistent interfaces between C++ template class specializations?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1242,"user_id":3166255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b36453789126d8d51d146a7e5b249a50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ian Ollmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166255/ian-ollmann"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1242,"user_id":3166255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b36453789126d8d51d146a7e5b249a50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ian Ollmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166255/ian-ollmann"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":2,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1568974430,"creation_date":1568942044,"last_edit_date":1568942562,"question_id":58020566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020566","body_markdown":"**Q: Are there are any compile time mechanisms in C++ I can use to automatically verify that the set of template class methods matches from class specialization to specialization?**\r\n\r\nExample: Let us suppose I want a class interface that has very different behaviors depending on a template value specialization:\r\n\r\n    // forward declaration of template class name\r\n    template &lt;typename T, bool isZero&gt; class MyClass;\r\n\r\n    // partial class specialization for isZero = false case\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt; class MyClass &lt;T, false&gt;\r\n    {\r\n       T _val;\r\n     \r\n    public:\r\n       MyClass(T value) { _val = value; }\r\n       T GetValue(void) const { return _val; }\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    // partial class specialization for isZero = true case\r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt; class MyClass &lt;T, true&gt;\r\n    {\r\n    public:\r\n       MyClass(T value) {}\r\n       T GetValue(void) const {return T(0);}\r\n    };\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that when compiling on Tuesdays, MyClass.GetValue() returns 0, whereas any other day of the week, we get the expected value ...or some such thing. The details and motivations are unimportant. ;-)\r\n\r\nNow, while this seems like one way to achieve partial function specialization based on partial class specialization, it also seems like it can also be utter chaos because the two class specializations can (AFAIK) have completely inconsistent interfaces.  If I am actually going to use this mechanism in a production setting, I would like some ideally compile time notification if I mistakenly add some methods to some specializations and not others or forget a const somewhere, etc. How do I get that?\r\n\r\n&gt; For bonus points, let us suppose I don&#39;t want to accidentally allow other values of isZero beyond\r\n&gt; (true/false) to compile as might occur if I provided a generic implementation of\r\n&gt; MyClass and let us also suppose I am suspicious of added runtime cost from adding virtual\r\n&gt; here for pure virtual base class methods.\r\n\r\nThis seems like such an obvious language feature that I&#39;m likely missing the forest for the trees here and maybe I&#39;m already getting this behavior through some mechanism and haven&#39;t realized it yet.\r\n\r\n    &gt;

      return super().form_valid(form)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the template of your `PostDetail` should look like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n#

My structure is:\r\n\r\n    myMainOjbect = { \r\n        attachment: {\r\n            handle: &#39;attachment&#39;,\r\n            slug: &#39;Images&#39;,\r\n            state: {\r\n                success: true,\r\n                data: {\r\n                    activated: false,\r\n                    info: {\r\n                        demo: &#39;demo-1&#39;,\r\n                        component: &#39;attachment&#39;,\r\n                    },\r\n                    success: true,\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    ..\r\n\r\nFirst, I loop through the high-level:\r\n\r\n    for(let key in myMainOjbect) {\r\n        const objectData = objectData[key];\r\n    }\r\nWhich shows me everything that&#39;s inside the `attachment` slug. But if I want to get `objectData.state`, suddenly, it&#39;s returned as `undefiend`.\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s going on here? Why can&#39;t I just simply access things and second, how can I actually do it?\r\n\r\nThe weirdest part is if I store my original object as a global in the console and I do the same thing I did in my

have a .csv file that contains the power consumed by a machine over a month long period. The file contains 4 readings per hour, so for a 24 hour period there are 96 values, then the next day starts. So to get the value for every Monday at 12:00:00AM the rows will be 96*7 = 672 rows apart. I want to get the mean for each time pertaining to a specific day of the week, such as Mondays at 12:00:00AM, and then save this to a dataframe for the average Monday.

Until recently, we let users put basically whatever they wanted in the href attribute of an anchor tag for a link. Some users creatively used this to embed little JavaScript apps. However, we decided that this was enough of a security concern that we want to prevent JavaScript from being used in the href, and to allow only urls for navigation.\r\n\r\nIn an attempt to sanitize this, I used the PHP’s `filter_var` function to validate the url, and further ensured that the scheme was http or https. This seems to do the trick, but also has the unfortunate side effect of breaking relative urls. \r\n\r\nHow else can I ensure that a url is reasonably “safe” (i.e., won’t have sneaky JavaScript) while not breaking relative urls? Is it as simple as checking if the string begins with `javaScript:`? I’ve seen enough malicious code to suspect it is more complicated than that, but I’m not sure what else to look out for.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I know what An XSS vulnerability is, and I’m not asking generally how to avoid all XSS issues. I’m asking, for code that looks roughly like this (although it actually uses angular to insert the vars):\r\n```html\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;$userHref&quot;&gt;$userAnchor&lt;/a&gt;\r\n```\r\nHow can I cleanly ensure that $userHref doesn’t execute JavaScript, but does allow navigation, with both relative and full paths.

it comes to WebSockets, it seems the internet has plenty of ws:// (insecure) tutorials, but hardly any on wss:// (secure).  I&#39;ve got an insecure websocket connection working fine with Node.js thanks to [Supun Kavinda&#39;s tutorial][1], but can&#39;t get it to work as a secure connection.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the summarized working code for the **insecure** connection (fake ip address):\r\n\r\n**File: js-index.js**\r\n\r\n    window.WebSocket = window.WebSocket || window.MozWebSocket;\r\n    var connection = new WebSocket(&#39;ws://3.00.00.00:8080&#39;);\r\n\r\n**File: server.js**\r\n\r\n    const https = require(&#39;https&#39;);\r\n    const fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\r\n    var WebsocketServer = require(&#39;websocket&#39;).server;\r\n\r\n    var server = https.createServer(function(request,response) {\r\n      function getPostParams(request, callback) {\r\n        var qs = require(&#39;querystring&#39;);\r\n        if (request.method == &#39;POST&#39;) {\r\n          var body = &#39;&#39;;\r\n          request.on(&#39;data&#39;, function (data) {\r\n            body += data;\r\n            // Too much POST data, kill the connection!\r\n            if (body.length &gt; 1e6)\r\n              request.connection.destroy();\r\n          });\r\n          request.on(&#39;end&#39;, function () {\r\n            var POST = qs.parse(body);\r\n            callback(POST);\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      if (request.method === &quot;POST&quot;) {\r\n        getPostParams(request, function(POST) {\r\n    \t\tmessageClients(POST.data);\r\n    \t\tresponse.writeHead(200);\r\n    \t\tresponse.end();\r\n    \t});\r\n    \treturn;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n    server.listen(8080);\r\n\r\n    /*Handling websocket requests*/\r\n    var websocketServer = new WebsocketServer({\r\n    \thttpServer: server\r\n    });\r\n    websocketServer.on(&quot;request&quot;, websocketRequest);\r\n    global.clients = {}; // connected clients\r\n    var connectionId = 0;\r\n    function websocketRequest(request) {\r\n      var connection = request.accept(null, request.origin);\r\n      connectionId++;\r\n      clients[connectionId] = connection;\r\n    }\r\n    function messageClients(message) {\r\n      for (var i in clients) {\r\n    \tclients[i].sendUTF(message);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor a secure connection, I have tried many things, mainly centered on changing ws:// to wss://, and including a .pem certificate/key in the createServer() call, like so:\r\n\r\n    const ssl_creds = {\r\n     cert: fs.readFileSync(&#39;/opt/bitnami/apache2/htdocs/fullchain.pem&#39;),\r\n     key: fs.readFileSync(&#39;/opt/bitnami/apache2/htdocs/privkey.pem&#39;)\r\n    };\r\n    var server = https.createServer(ssl_creds, function(request,response) {....\r\n\r\nHowever, I continue to get errors (only testing in Chrome thus far), such as:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID\r\n&gt; 2. Error during WebSocket handshake: Sent non-empty &#39;Sec-WebSocket-Protocol&#39; header but no response was received\r\n\r\n*^#1 being the problem I encounter most*\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the same ssl credentials granted by LetsEncrypt for my website itself - I assume that is okay?\r\n\r\nIn summary, most of the tutorials I&#39;ve found either do something exactly like this, or talk about how something like NGINX is required to setup proxies/tunnels - something I am completely clueless on.\r\n\r\nCan someone tell me if proxy configurations are typically required for this, or if I&#39;m just missing something small/dumb?  Any insight at all would be appreciated.  In case it&#39;s relevant, I&#39;m just cutting my teeth on AWS with a Lightsail PHP image from Bitnami.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.hyvor.com/php/chat-app-with-php-nodejs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020506/what-are-the-minimum-requirements-to-get-a-secure-websocket-working-with-node-js","title":"What are the minimum requirements to get a secure WebSocket working with Node.js?"},{"tags":["android","android-constraintlayout"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":98,"user_id":10505662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oB77d.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Poyyamozhi Ramakrishnan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10505662/poyyamozhi-ramakrishnan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568958370,"post_id":58020504,"comment_id":102447546,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020504/constraintlayout-how-to-not-match-constraints-when-programatically-height-set-t#comment102447546_58020504"}],"owner":{"reputation":8001,"user_id":1541188,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0a05a09fcfd23c6dedbd9e407a788f3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"urSus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1541188/ursus"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568941454,"creation_date":1568941454,"question_id":58020504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020504","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on the &quot;edge to edge&quot; UI, because of some reasons I place a dummy view inside the layout that acts as a navbar offset which rest of the UI constraints it self to.\r\n\r\nHowever in some cases bottom windowInsets from the system are 0, which makes the fake nav bar be fullscreen size.\r\n\r\nI set it via \r\n\r\n    fakeNavBar.layoutParams.height = height\r\n    fakeNavBar.requestLayout()\r\n    \r\n    &lt;View\r\n    \tandroid:id=&quot;@+id/fakeNavBar&quot;\r\n    \tandroid:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n    \tandroid:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n    \tapp:layout_constraintBottom_toBottomOf=&quot;parent&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\nSo, I read 0dp height means &quot;match constraint&quot;. \r\n\r\nFirst of all I don&#39;t see why does it make the view full screen, i.e. full height (looks equivalent to match_parent both width and height; I would understand if there was constraintTop_toTopOf=&quot;parent&quot;, but there isn&#39;t)\r\n\r\nSecond of all, is there a way to turn this off?

I&#39;m not using any locks though I probably should (eventually).\r\n\r\nOther users of the class instance then sometimes try to read the contents of the list.\r\n\r\n**Problem:** At the end of the timer handler, the list is populated correctly (I&#39;ve printed its contents in the logs) but when a user of the class instance reads the instance variable, it&#39;s empty!

review your `ChatComponent` Component, it initializes and tries to set up a connection to the Hub. Its `ngOnInit()` returns **immediately** after it binds an event handler for `ReceiveMessage`. \r\n\r\n```typescript\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl(...).build();\r\n    this.hubConnection\r\n      .start()\r\n      .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#39;Connection started!&#39;))\r\n      .catch(err =&gt; console.log(&#39;Error while establishing connection :(&#39;));\r\n    this.hubConnection.on(&#39;ReceiveMessage&#39;, ...);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote it will take some time to connect to the Hub. If you try to send messages to the server **before the connection is set up**, it throws.\r\n\r\n## How to fix:\r\n\r\nCreate a `thenable` to ensure the connection has been set up.\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n  &lt;b&gt;private thenable: Promise&amp;lt;void&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n    ...\r\n    this.hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl(...).build();\r\n    &lt;b&gt;this.start()&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    this.hubConnection.on(&#39;ReceiveMessage&#39;, ...);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private start() {\r\n    &lt;b&gt;this.thenable = this.hubConnection.start();&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    &lt;b&gt;this.thenable&lt;/b&gt;\r\n      .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#39;Connection started!&#39;))\r\n      .catch(err =&gt; console.log(&#39;Error while establishing connection :(&#39;));\r\n  }\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nWhenever you want to communicate with the Hub, invoke by `thenable` in promise-style. For example, your `sendMessage()` should be changed in the following way:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\npublic sendMessage(): void {\r\n    &lt;b&gt;this.thenable.then(() =&gt;{&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        var today = new Date();\r\n        this.messageData = ...\r\n        this.hubConnection\r\n           .invoke(&#39;SendToAll&#39;, this.author, this.messageData)\r\n           .catch(err =&gt; console.error(err));\r\n           this.message = &#39;&#39;;\r\n    &lt;b&gt;});&lt;/b&gt;\r\n}\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**[Update]**\r\n\r\nThere&#39;re two other bugs in your code :\r\n\r\n1. You registered the SignalR middleware after the Spa middleware. Be aware `UseSpa()` should be used as a catch-all middleware. You should invoke `UseSignalR()` before `UseSpa()`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;\r\n    &lt;b&gt;app.UseSignalR(routes =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        routes.MapHub&amp;lt;ChatHub&amp;gt;(&quot;/api/chat&quot;);\r\n    });&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    \r\n    app.UseMvc(routes =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    app.UseSpa(spa =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    &lt;strike&gt;app.UseSignalR(routes =&gt;                        &lt;/strike&gt;\r\n    &lt;strike&gt;{                                               &lt;/strike&gt;\r\n    &lt;strike&gt;    routes.MapHub&amp;lt;ChatHub&amp;gt;(&quot;/api/chat&quot;);  &lt;/strike&gt;\r\n    &lt;strike&gt;});                                             &lt;/strike&gt;\r\n    &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n2. If you&#39;re connecting to the same server, avoid using hard-coded url:\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;\r\n    this.hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder().withUrl(&quot;&lt;strike&gt;http://localhost:5000&lt;/strike&gt;/api/chat&quot;, {\r\n          skipNegotiation: true,\r\n          transport: HttpTransportType.WebSockets\r\n        }).build();\r\n    &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n    Otherwise, it fails when you&#39;re using a different port/protocol.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020453/net-core-angular-project-cannot-send-data-if-the-connection-is-not-in-the-conne/58021224#58021224","title":".NET core angular project cannot send data if the connection is not in the connected state?"}],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":4570249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/339348002931153/picture?type=large","display_name":"Wasiim Ouro-sama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4570249/wasiim-ouro-sama"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64,"user_id":4570249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/339348002931153/picture?type=large","display_name":"Wasiim Ouro-sama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4570249/wasiim-ouro-sama"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58021224,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569221860,"creation_date":1568940917,"last_edit_date":1568948377,"question_id":58020453,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020453","body_markdown":"I&#39;m running a .NET core angular project in VScode on windows and I&#39;m trying to get signalR to work but unfortunately things don&#39;t seem to be going my way.Before when I had my angular and .net core projects split up(web API and angular project separate) with the same code, this issue did not occur.

But it&#39;s not.\r\n\r\nAnother option to write ```row_1``` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrow_1 = [np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, 7, 8, np.nan, \r\nnp.nan, np.nan, np.nan, np.nan, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, np.nan, ...]\r\n```\r\nSo ```(start, end)``` tuple should be ```(7, 8)``` and ```(14, 23)```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020440/get-first-and-last-elements-from-list-according-to-enumerate-list-python","title":"Get first and last elements from list according to enumerate list Python"},{"tags":["python","excel","pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568947941,"post_id":58020437,"comment_id":102445504,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020437/reading-a-text-file-in-python-with-200000-lines#comment102445504_58020437"},{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568948033,"post_id":58020437,"comment_id":102445519,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020437/reading-a-text-file-in-python-with-200000-lines#comment102445519_58020437"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":11157630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EVhPC6HpcAM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdRZo4sj0gm5mFwXFEO3k1fdSHABA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ML learner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11157630/ml-learner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568950982,"post_id":58020437,"comment_id":102445964,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020437/reading-a-text-file-in-python-with-200000-lines#comment102445964_58020437"},{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568953653,"post_id":58020437,"comment_id":102446445,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58020437/reading-a-text-file-in-python-with-200000-lines#comment102446445_58020437"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":11157630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EVhPC6HpcAM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdRZo4sj0gm5mFwXFEO3k1fdSHABA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ML learner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11157630/ml-learner"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568940686,"creation_date":1568940686,"question_id":58020437,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58020437","body_markdown":"I have a csv file with 10K lines.\r\nI am able to read :\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n      features = pd.read_csv(&quot;data/kt/features.csv&quot;, dtype=np.float64)\r\n      targets = pd.read_csv(&quot;data/kt/targets.csv&quot;, dtype=np.float64)\r\n       for i in range(len(features)-1):\r\n         yield {\r\n            &quot;inputs&quot;: list(features.iloc[i]),\r\n            &quot;targets&quot;: list(targets.iloc[i])\r\n            }\r\n\r\nbut now I have text files with 200000 lines .
