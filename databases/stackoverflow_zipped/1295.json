Here would be a simple sequenced implementation.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: rust --&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync fn my_function(files: Vec&lt;File&gt;) -&gt; bool {\r\n    // Run the future on each file, return early if we received true\r\n    for file in files {\r\n        if long_future(file).await {\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    false\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync fn long_future(file: File) -&gt; bool {\r\n    // Some long-running task here...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works, but I&#39;d like to run a few of these futures concurrently to speed up the process. I came across [`buffer_unordered()`](https://docs.rs/futures-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures/stream/trait.StreamExt.html#method.buffer_unordered) (on `Stream`), but couldn&#39;t figure out how to implement this.\n\r\nAs I understand it, something like [`join`](https://docs.rs/futures-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures/?search=Join) can be used as well to run futures concurrently, given that you gave a multithreaded pool. But I don&#39;t see how that could efficiently be used here.\n\nI attempted something like this, but couldn&#39;t get it to work:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: rust --&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet any_true = futures::stream::iter(files)\r\n    .buffer_unordered(4) // Run up to 4 concurrently\r\n    .map(|file| long_future(file).await)\r\n    .filter(|stop| stop) // Only propagate true values\r\n    .next() // Return early on first true\r\n    .is_some();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlong with that, I&#39;m looking for something like [`any`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.any) as used in iterators, to replace the if-statement or the `filter().next().is_some()` combination.\r\n\r\nHow would I go about this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234162/rust-async-await-check-if-any-future-in-a-list-resolves-to-true-concurrently","title":"Rust async-await: check if any future in a list

Is there any way, where only the changed components are detected from repository workspace) and built, instead of loading &amp; building all components.\r\nIs anyone did this by writing some Ant script or Groovy?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234158/rtc-jenkins-build-only-for-changed-components","title":"RTC + Jenkins - Build only for changed components"},{"tags":["lucene"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4020,"user_id":2529954,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShWjR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EricLavault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2529954/ericlavault"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570203742,"post_id":58234154,"comment_id":102851548,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234154/lucene-query-with-both-wildcard-and-not#comment102851548_58234154"},{"owner":{"reputation":1050,"user_id":877513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38282c8b8fdb50843eae36bbc3a284fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zhihong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/877513/zhihong"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4020,"user_id":2529954,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShWjR.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EricLavault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2529954/ericlavault"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570539955,"post_id":58234154,"comment_id":102938649,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234154/lucene-query-with-both-wildcard-and-not#comment102938649_58234154"},{"owner":{"reputation":7290,"user_id":2663985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/531b51e8cd1cf8655256f3e913ed9eef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mysterion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2663985/mysterion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570789471,"post_id":58234154,"comment_id":103034001,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234154/lucene-query-with-both-wildcard-and-not#comment103034001_58234154"}],"owner":{"reputation":1050,"user_id":877513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38282c8b8fdb50843eae36bbc3a284fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"zhihong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/877513/zhihong"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7290,"user_id":2663985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/531b51e8cd1cf8655256f3e913ed9eef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mysterion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2663985/mysterion"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570789368,"creation_date":1570183258,"last_edit_date":1570789368,"question_id":58234154,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58234154","body_markdown":"I try to run a Lucene query to include some dates and exclude some dates.\r\nBut I notice that combination wildcards and NOT seems dose not work.

This seems so simple that I must be overlooking something that the default SwiftUI views do?\r\n\r\nNavigationView\r\n---\r\nI wrap a `UINavigationController` in a super simple `UIViewControllerRepresentable` that gives the `UINavigationController` to the SwiftUI content view as an environmentObject. This means the `NavigationLink` can later grab that as long as it&#39;s in the same navigation controller (presented view controllers don&#39;t receive the environmentObjects) which is exactly what we want.\r\n\r\n**Note:** The NavigationView needs `.edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)` and I don&#39;t know how to set that in the struct itself yet. See example if your nvc cuts off at the top.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct NavigationView&lt;Content: View&gt;: UIViewControllerRepresentable {\r\n    \r\n    var content: () -&gt; Content\r\n    \r\n    init(@ViewBuilder content: @escaping () -&gt; Content) {\r\n        self.content = content\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func makeUIViewController(context: Context) -&gt; UINavigationController {\r\n        let nvc = UINavigationController()\r\n        let host = UIHostingController(rootView: content().environmentObject(nvc))\r\n        nvc.viewControllers = [host]\r\n        return nvc\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    func updateUIViewController(_ uiViewController: UINavigationController, context: Context) {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNavigationLink\r\n---\r\n\r\nI create a custom NavigationLink that accesses the environments UINavigationController to push a UIHostingController hosting the next view.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I didn&#39;t implement the `selection` and `isActive` that the SwiftUI.NavigationLink has because I don&#39;t fully understand what they do yet. If you want to help with that please comment/edit.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct NavigationLink&lt;Destination: View, Label:View&gt;: View {\r\n    var destination: Destination\r\n    var label: () -&gt; Label\r\n    \r\n    public init(destination: Destination, @ViewBuilder label: @escaping () -&gt; Label) {\r\n        self.destination = destination\r\n        self.label = label\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    /// If this crashes, make sure you wrapped the NavigationLink in a NavigationView\r\n    @EnvironmentObject var nvc: UINavigationController\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        Button(action: {\r\n            let rootView = self.destination.environmentObject(self.nvc)\r\n            let hosted = UIHostingController(rootView: rootView)\r\n            self.nvc.pushViewController(hosted, animated: true)\r\n        }, label: label)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis solves the back swipe not working correctly on SwiftUI and because I use the names NavigationView and NavigationLink my entire project switched to these immediately.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n---\r\nIn the example I show modal presentation too. \r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    @State var isPresented = false\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        NavigationView {\r\n            VStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 30) {\r\n                NavigationLink(destination: Text(&quot;Detail&quot;), label: {\r\n                    Text(&quot;Show detail&quot;)\r\n                })\r\n                Button(action: {\r\n                    self.isPresented.toggle()\r\n                }, label: {\r\n                    Text(&quot;Show modal&quot;)\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n            .navigationBarTitle(&quot;SwiftUI&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n        .edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)\r\n        .sheet(isPresented: $isPresented) {\r\n            Modal()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nstruct Modal: View {\r\n    @Environment(\\.presentationMode) var presentationMode\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        NavigationView {\r\n            VStack(alignment: .center, spacing: 30) {\r\n                NavigationLink(destination: Text(&quot;Detail&quot;), label: {\r\n                    Text(&quot;Show detail&quot;)\r\n                })\r\n                Button(action: {\r\n                    self.presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()\r\n                }, label: {\r\n                    Text(&quot;Dismiss modal&quot;)\r\n                })\r\n            }\r\n            .navigationBarTitle(&quot;Modal&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit: I started off with &quot;This seems so simple that I must be overlooking something&quot; and I think I found it.

In order to restrict access to only paying members I was planning to use MemberPress. I created a special category for the post and published them as such. The I set up a rule in MemberPress to give access to only to subscribers.\r\n\r\nTested access to the posts and can see the content from my Browser and all is fine with that.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that when I try to do the same using WordPressPCL although I am properly authorized from the JWT/WordPress perspective I don&#39;t have access to the content. It looks like MemberPress blocks an authorized user coming via WordPressPCL but allows access when coming via the web browser.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happen when I try to post *pages* as opposed to *posts*. I should also mention that I can download all posts metadata but not the content of each post which takes me to &quot;You are unauthorized to view this page&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe code below retrieves all posts with a certain title and certain category but **myPosts.Content.Rendered == &quot;You are unauthorized to view this page&quot;** for all posts.\r\n\r\n     try\r\n            {\r\n                WordPressClient client = await GetClient(clientURL,userName,password);\r\n                if (await client.IsValidJWToken())\r\n                {\r\n                    var posts = await client.Posts.GetAll();\r\n                    var myPosts = posts.Where(p =&gt; p.Categories[0] == category &amp;&amp; p.Title.Rendered == title);\r\n                }\r\n...\r\n\r\nI tried a similar thing without JWT. I can authenticate but cannot retrieve page content:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n            CookieContainer cc = new CookieContainer();\r\n            var request = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(loginUri);\r\n            request.Proxy = null;\r\n            request.AllowAutoRedirect = false;\r\n            request.CookieContainer = cc;\r\n            request.Method = &quot;post&quot;;\r\n\r\n            request.ContentType = &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;;\r\n            request.ContentLength = requestData.Length;\r\n\r\n            using (Stream s = request.GetRequestStream())\r\n                s.Write(requestData, 0, requestData.Length);\r\n\r\n            using (HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse())\r\n            {\r\n                foreach (Cookie c in response.Cookies)\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(c.Name + &quot; = &quot; + c.Value);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            string newloginUri = &quot;http://localhost/myWP/myPostforToday/&quot;;\r\n            HttpWebRequest newrequest = (HttpWebRequest)WebRequest.Create(newloginUri);\r\n            newrequest.Proxy = null;\r\n            newrequest.CookieContainer = cc;\r\n            using (HttpWebResponse newresponse = (HttpWebResponse)newrequest.GetResponse())\r\n            using (Stream resSteam = newresponse.GetResponseStream())\r\n            using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(resSteam))\r\n                File.WriteAllText(@&quot;retrievedpage.html&quot;, sr.ReadToEnd());\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect that MemeberPress rules restrict the access but I couldn&#39;t find any solution. Some guidance on how to handle this ( with or without MemberPress involvement) would be really appreciated.

faced this problem recently, so I will share what I tried and what it worked for me. Note that I needed to implement a change-font action at runtime as well.\r\n\r\n In a Swing application, we usually expand container classes for the core containers. Let&#39;s say we want to create Facebook for desktop. Someone could create 3 core classes (extending JPanel or JScrollPane). Let&#39;s say: `LeftPanel extends JPanel`, `MiddlePanel extends JPanel` and `RightPanel extends JPanel`. Left panel will represent the left menu, middle panel will represent the main scrolling view and finally the right panel will represent the ads area. Of course, every single of this panels will have inherited `JPanel`s (and probably some of them will have a new class as well, e.g `PostPanel`, `CommentSectionPanel` etc.)\r\n\r\nNow, assuming you have read [The Use of Multiple JFrames: Good or Bad Practice?][1], your application uses only one `JFrame` and it hosts every single component in it. Even modal `JDialog`s are based on it (have it as its parent). So, you can keep it somewhere like a `Singleton`.\r\n\r\nIn order to change components text, we will have to call `setText` for each one of them. Calling `JFrame`&#39;s `getComponents` will give us all its components. If one of them is container, we will have to call `getComponents` for it, since it probably has components in it as well. The solution is a recursion to find all of them:\r\n\r\n\tprivate static &lt;T extends Component&gt; List&lt;T&gt; getChildren(Class&lt;T&gt; clazz, final Container container) {\r\n\t\tComponent[] components;\r\n\t\tif (container instanceof JMenu)\r\n\t\t\tcomponents = ((JMenu) container).getMenuComponents();\r\n\t\telse\r\n\t\t\tcomponents = container.getComponents();\r\n\t\tList&lt;T&gt; compList = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;();\r\n\t\tfor (Component comp : components) {\r\n\t\t\tif (clazz.isAssignableFrom(comp.getClass())) {\r\n\t\t\t\tcompList.add(clazz.cast(comp));\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tif (comp instanceof Container)\r\n\t\t\t\tcompList.addAll(getChildren(clazz, (Container) comp));\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn compList;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nCalling this method with arguments `java.awt.Component.class` and `myJFrame` will give you all the components your `JFrame` has.\r\n\r\nNow, we have to separate which of them can be &quot;refreshed&quot; (change language) and which of them can&#39;t. Let&#39;s create an `Interface` for that:\r\n\r\n    public static interface LocaleChangeable {\r\n    \tvoid localeChanged(Locale newLocale);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow instead of giving this ability to each one of them, we give it to the big containers (the example with facebook):\r\n`LeftPanel extends JPanel implements LocaleChangeable`, `RightPanel extends JPanel implements LocaleChangeable` because they have components with text property.\r\n\r\nThese classes now are responsible for changing the text of their components. A pseduo-example would be:\r\n\r\n    public class LeftPanel extends JPanel implements LocaleChangeable {\r\n    \tprivate JLabel exitLabel;\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic void localeChanged(Locale newLocale) {\r\n    \t\tif (newLocale == Locale.ENGLISH) {\r\n    \t\t\texitLabel.setText(&quot;Exit&quot;);\r\n    \t\t} else if (newLocale == Locale.GREEK) {\r\n    \t\t\texitLabel.setText(&quot;Έξοδος&quot;); //Greek exit\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(Of course instead of a bunch of `if-else` conditions, the `ResourceBundle` logic will take place).\r\n\r\nSo... Let&#39;s call this method for all classes-containers:\r\n\r\n\tprivate void broadcastLocaleChange(Locale locale) {\r\n\t\tList&lt;Component&gt; components = getChildren(Component.class, myFrame);\r\n\t\tcomponents.stream().filter(LocaleChangeable.class::isInstance).map(LocaleChangeable.class::cast)\r\n\t\t\t\t.forEach(lc -&gt; lc.localeChanged(locale));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it!

Therefore I am trying to use InlineData, which I understand is xUnits &quot;TestCase&quot;, but I don&#39;t know how to do it.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to set it up, as shown below (please see the outcommented lines), then it tells me        \r\n\r\n        [Theory]\r\n        // [InlineData(&quot;&quot;)] // wanna use InlineData just to make the code/test cleaner.\r\n        // [InlineData(null)]\r\n        public async Task Get_Return_Something(\r\n            MyController sut)\r\n        {\r\n            var result1 = await sut.Get(&quot;&quot;); // when placing &quot;sut&quot; as param, I get: cannot convert from MyController to string. \r\n            var result2 = await sut.Get(null); // same applies here..\r\n\r\n            result1.ShouldBeOfType(typeof(OkObjectResult));\r\n            result2.ShouldBeOfType(typeof(BadRequestObjectResult));\r\n        }\r\n\r\nMy question is - how do I implement the InlineData so that the test is cleaner. And is it even possible when I have a controller as a parameter?\r\n\r\nJust to clarify it -&gt; should there be a way to use the syntax from nUnit:\r\n\r\n    // something like this\r\n    [TestCase(&quot;&quot;, OkObjectResult)]\r\n    [TestCase(null, BadRequestObjectResult)]\r\n    public async Task Get_Return_Something(MyController sut, param1, param2)\r\n    {\r\n        var result = await.sut.Get(param1);\r\n        result.ShouldBeOfType(typeof(param2));\r\n    }\r\n    \r\nMaybe the nUnit example is incorrect - but I&#39;m trying to point out, what I am looking for, by saying cleaner code.

But even passing `0xDEADBEEF` should compile correctly (returning `FALSE`).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234087/what-is-the-action-of-define-in-this-instance/58234220#58234220","title":"What is the Action of #define in this Instance?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44,"user_id":11094853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c26974b35c81e0675ca4416101ebf045?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11094853/alex"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570184626,"post_id":58234228,"comment_id":102842246,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234087/what-is-the-action-of-define-in-this-instance/58234228#comment102842246_58234228"},{"owner":{"reputation":94494,"user_id":298225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef102f4ee36e58d09e0b27cd5393a1d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Postpischil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298225/eric-postpischil"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570188817,"post_id":58234228,"comment_id":102844215,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234087/what-is-the-action-of-define-in-this-instance/58234228#comment102844215_58234228"},{"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":94494,"user_id":298225,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef102f4ee36e58d09e0b27cd5393a1d8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eric Postpischil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/298225/eric-postpischil"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570189224,"post_id":58234228,"comment_id":102844408,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234087/what-is-the-action-of-define-in-this-instance/58234228#comment102844408_58234228"},{"owner":{"reputation":146545,"user_id":240443,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/495d675e3bc42ed1dee469e2ce701f1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amadan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/240443/amadan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570190297,"post_id":58234228,"comment_id":102844871,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234087/what-is-the-action-of-define-in-this-instance/58234228#comment102844871_58234228"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2355,"user_id":459565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc92778353971733be88d04c26603ec7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eugene","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/459565/eugene"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570187964,"last_edit_date":1570187964,"creation_date":1570183502,"answer_id":58234228,"question_id":58234087,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58234228","body_markdown":"The last five `#define` statements you give define ***macros***, each taking an ***argument***, which is here always called `c`.

In the material, it says that before feeding this information to the OLS-method in the stats models.api, I have to define a new column called &quot;intercept&quot;, where the only value is 1. Why do I have to do this and why does the value of intercept has to be 1? I thought that the value of the intercept is something that is defined later, AFTER the linear regression has been programmed by Python?\r\n\r\nHere is my data frame:\r\n\r\n        price   area\r\n

struggling with a popover design with nested colmun-flowed flexbox. My problem is that when the &quot;2nd level&quot; flexbox wraps, it keeps its initial width for some reason, so it overflows.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, as the problem is on the &quot;perpendicular&quot; axis, the only property that could have an effect on this is the &quot;align-items&quot;. But I tried every possible combination, without success.  \r\nSetting a fixed width for the wrapper works, but then it&#39;s not responsive anymore. Small caveat: the number of inputs is dynamic and unknown in advance.\r\n  \r\nHere is a fiddle of what I&#39;m trying to make :\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false

the computed size of the form which happens to be the size of the first column.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234047/nested-column-flowed-flexbox-width-shrinked","title":"Nested

pattern how to define variables in a classes is as follows:\r\n\r\n    class Xxxx:\r\n        staticVar = ...\r\n    \r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            self.instanceVar = ...\r\n\r\nSo each variable used in a class should be defined:\r\n\r\n  - either as a **static** variable (not &quot;owned&quot; by any particular instance of\r\n    this class), created in this class, outside any method,\r\n  - or as a **instance** variable (owned by particular instance), created by the\r\n    constructor.\r\n\r\nA class variable can also be defined in other method, within this class.\r\n\r\nYour code contains a single place where *self.data* is assigned,\r\nin *StockData.stock* method, but this method is **never** called.\r\n\r\nOther places where you refer to *self.data* have the form of:\r\n\r\n     self.data[...] =  self.data[...]...\r\n\r\nso at this time, this variable must be created earlier.\r\n\r\nOne of possible solutions is to add a constructor (maybe to *StockData*)\r\nand set this variable to whatever value you wish.\r\n\r\nOr maybe you should call *stock* somewhere in your code?\r\n\r\nAnother concept is to:\r\n\r\n  - turn this function into a constructor (leaving *symbol* parameter),\r\n  - when you call *sma = Backtest()*, pass some value for this parameter.\r\n\r\nBut probably you should change *append* to *extend*. The reason is that\r\nif you pass a string as *symbol*, it is actually also a list of chars,\r\nso *ticker* will contain **individual chars**.\r\nBut if you change to *extend*, the whole string will be added as one\r\nelement.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234041/attributeerror-backtest-object-has-no-attribute-data-pandas-sma-crossover/58242375#58242375","title":"AttributeError:

It means `const a = 1` and a will be unable to reassign a value. But, if I assign a object to `const` variable (`const a = { x: 1}`), i still can update value of fields inside the object, but cannot reassign the object. Because, assigning object to const is assigning reference of object to a variable, not a value inside them.\r\n\r\nBut, If I tell someone who doesn&#39;t know anything about coding that const is unable reassign variable.

&lt;?php\r\n    $xml = &lt;&lt;&lt;&#39;EOD&#39;\r\n    &lt;Description&gt;\r\n        &lt;CompleteText&gt;\r\n            &lt;DetailTxt&gt;\r\n                &lt;Text&gt;\r\n                    &lt;span&gt;Here there is some text&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                    &lt;h2&gt;And maybe a headline&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n                    &lt;br/&gt;\r\n                    &lt;span&gt;Normal

Many of the created objects contain pointers to large amounts of memory (for example, pointcloud data from a 3D-camera points to a buffer that&#39;s over a megabyte in size). Things have been set up in such a way that when the JS-object is GC&#39;ed, the underlying native object should be destroyed as well (by using our own reference counter under the hood). Yesterday it turned out that it didn&#39;t work as well as we thought because we ran out of memory by leaking about a megabyte every second.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I&#39;m having trouble finding info about how to properly deal with these kinds of large objects in Node.JS. I&#39;ve found a function called `napi_adjust_external_memory` which lets me tell how much data is in use and which &quot;will trigger global garbage collections more often than it would otherwise&quot;, but I don&#39;t know if this can be used if no other parts of the N-API are used. It&#39;s not clear to me either if the OOM-error is caused by errors in our C++-codebase, or Node.JS falsely assuming it&#39;s using less memory than it actually is and not triggering the GC for those objects as a result. \r\n\r\nSo, in summary, my question is as follows:\r\n\r\n- Is it possible that these objects were never collected despite the memory pressure?\r\n\r\n- Can I use napi_adjust_external_memory to trigger the GC more regularly without using other parts of the N-API?\r\n\r\n- How should I deal with large native objects in Node.JS in order to ensure they don&#39;t leak?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58233951/memory-leak-when-using-node-js-native-modules","title":"Memory leak when using Node.JS native

far as I know `SPLIT` removes the separator from the results and it doesn&#39;t seem like you can change that.\r\n\r\nBut you could create your own separator by first replacing your `&lt;br/&gt;` tag with `&lt;br/&gt;` plus an arbitrary string that is highly unlikely to ever appear in your HTML source, and then split the HTML using this arbitrary string as a separator instead.\r\n\r\n    types:\r\n      begin of t_result,\r\n        segment(2000) type c,\r\n      end of t_result.\r\n\r\n    DATA:\r\n      source type string,\r\n      separator type string,\r\n      brtag type string,\r\n      repl type string,\r\n      result_tab type standard table of t_result,\r\n      result_row TYPE t_result.\r\n\r\n    brtag = &#39;&lt;br/&gt;&#39;.\r\n    separator = &#39;|***SEP***|&#39;.\r\n    concatenate brtag separator into repl.\r\n    source = &#39;&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;br/&gt;some more text&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;&#39;.\r\n\r\n    replace all occurrences of brtag in source with repl.\r\n    split source at separator into table result_tab.\r\n\r\n    LOOP AT result_tab INTO result_row.\r\n      WRITE:\r\n      result_row-segment.\r\n    ENDLOOP.\r\n\r\nOutput of that example report:\r\n\r\n    &lt;HTML&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;&lt;p&gt;some text&lt;br/&gt;\r\n    some more

I am confused as to where in the Ray code I should initialize the dataset as well as where to put the for-loops for defining the epoch and enumerating the dataset batches.\r\n\r\n## Background ##\r\nIn my normal training script, I follow several steps:  \r\n1. Parse the model options,  \r\n2. Initialize the dataset,  \r\n3. Create and initialize the model,  \r\n4. For-loop for progressing through the epochs,  \r\n5. Nested for-loop for enumerating the dataset batches  \r\n  \r\nThe Ray.Tune documentation says that when defining the Trainable class object, that I really only need _setup, _train, _save, and _restore. As I understand it, the _train() is for a single iteration and increments the training_iteration automatically. Given that the dataset_size may not be cleanly divisible by the batchSize, I calculate the total_steps as the training progresses.
