You&#39;re right about how aggregation works, unless you have a match filter as first stage, it will fetch all the documents and then applies the next stage.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385445/mongodb-querying-large-datasets/58462638#58462638","title":"MongoDB Querying Large Datasets"}],"owner":{"reputation":205,"user_id":1955934,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c41a3b45d9cf84bae49ebe3f24fdca5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1955934","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1955934/user1955934"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571480207,"creation_date":1571097483,"question_id":58385445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58385445","body_markdown":"Lets say I have simple document structure like:\r\n\r\n        {\r\n         &quot;item&quot;: { \r\n              &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Skittles&quot;,\r\n              &quot;category&quot;: &quot;Candies &amp; Snacks&quot;\r\n         }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my search page, whenever user searches for product name, I want to have a filter options by category.\r\n\r\nSince categories can be many (like 50 types) I cannot display all of the checkboxes on the sidebar beside the search results.

Out of these time series, I&#39;m interested in a particular sub-sequence or pattern that looks like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ozcId.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nI&#39;m interested in sub-sequences that resemble the overall shape of the highlighted section -- that is, a sub-sequence with a sharp negative slope, followed by a period of several hours where the slope is relatively flat before finally ending with a sharp positive slope. I know the sub-sequences I&#39;m interested in won&#39;t match each other exactly and most likely will be shifted in time, scaled differently, have longer/shorter periods where the slope is relatively flat, etc. but I would like to find a way to detect them all. \r\n\r\nTo do this, I have developed a simple Heuristic (based on my definition of the highlighted section) to quickly find some of the sub-sequences of interest. However, I was wondering if there was a more elegant way (in Python) to search thousands of time series for the sub-sequence I&#39;m interested in (while taking into account things mentioned above -- differences in time, scale, etc.)?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385420/finding-similar-sub-sequences-in-a-time-series","title":"Finding similar sub-sequences in a time series?"},{"tags":["function","class","c++14","stdmap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8398,"user_id":1270789,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FXwoB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ken Y-N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1270789/ken-y-n"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571097501,"post_id":58385416,"comment_id":103118628,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385416/cant-get-stdmap-to-insert-from-function#comment103118628_58385416"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571098424,"post_id":58385416,"comment_id":103118785,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385416/cant-get-stdmap-to-insert-from-function#comment103118785_58385416"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571098497,"post_id":58385416,"comment_id":103118800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385416/cant-get-stdmap-to-insert-from-function#comment103118800_58385416"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12217379,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD-bRl2NogjuwxPcngHdl9diLCPlVt7OxC98zkLBA=k-s128","display_name":"mrnapkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217379/mrnapkins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571100569,"post_id":58385416,"comment_id":103119115,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385416/cant-get-stdmap-to-insert-from-function#comment103119115_58385416"},{"owner":{"reputation":3879,"user_id":920069,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39f0db1f22e1314746491df063602a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Retired Ninja","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/920069/retired-ninja"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571109147,"post_id":58385416,"comment_id":103120702,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385416/cant-get-stdmap-to-insert-from-function#comment103120702_58385416"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":1697026,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8416c5a3179b40633ac1c5126ed1a29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Kennedy Araujo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1697026/david-kennedy-araujo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":119,"user_id":1697026,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8416c5a3179b40633ac1c5126ed1a29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"David Kennedy Araujo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1697026/david-kennedy-araujo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571103137,"last_edit_date":1571103137,"creation_date":1571102801,"answer_id":58386018,"question_id":58385416,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386018","body_markdown":"If the basic STD map usage works, maybe the problem sits in your `condition` implementation\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;map&gt;\r\n    \r\n    class Foo {\r\n      std::map&lt;std::string, int&gt;

So, I created a &lt;nav&gt; and placed an &lt;ul&gt; in it. The list contains three &lt;li&gt;s and each of them has an &lt;a&gt; inside. I wish my list items to be placed horizontally with spaces between / around them. Thus, I decided to use flexbox in this case. The question is that when I am setting display property value of my &lt;ul&gt; to flex and justify-content to center, it work predictably (i.e. all the list items sticked to each other are centered horizontally), however, as soon as I set justify-content to &quot;space-between&quot; or &quot;space-around&quot; I get an extra space to the right side of my content, which makes this space three times bigger than the one on the left side of the content. \r\nI tried to search this topic in the history, but found nothing similar. Google search brought me a potential solution - to set flex:1 to each of the list items. But in this case I loose the gaps between the items which is not my intention.\r\nBelow I provide a picture of the problem and my testing code snippets.

Quicksort can find k-th element in O(n) in average if used till the pivot is proved to be the k-th element itself (O(n^2) worst case and O(n) in average).\r\n\r\nNow the tricky part: you need to restore the original array. It is simple for the first iteration of the partition procedure on the sorted array: just run the procedure in opposite direction and reconstruct the initial array. Now the recursive idea emerges: if the pivot happens to be larger than k-th element, you still have left subarray sorted: you may repeat the procedure, find the k-th and restore the array. But if you find that the pivot is lower than k-th element... then restore the array and run the quicksort &quot;reflected&quot; (where you start moving from right to the left). In this case the right subarray from the pivot would be sorted.

Right-clicking on the grid produces a menu with three blank items. However, the header bindings are not working (each menu item is blank). Did I miss something from the answer I linked? Do I need to make some sort of proxy class [as mentioned here][2]? That seems rather convoluted for a simple task like making a context menu and isn&#39;t even hinted at in the first answer I linked to.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

This mostly just avoids a messy hassle when you get near the end of the array/slice.\r\n\r\nc) using SIMD in a loop:\r\n\r\n- load a group of values into a SIMD register\r\n- copy the group to another SIMD register\r\n- use &quot;unsigned shift right&quot; then &quot;AND&quot; on the entire group of numbers so that the lowest bit in each number contains the original number&#39;s sign bit\r\n- add the result of this to a &quot;group of counters of negative numbers&quot; in a different SIMD register\r\n- use a sequence of &quot;shift&quot; and &quot;OR&quot;, to merge all bits of a number into a single bit, to get &quot;1 if original number was non-zero, 0 if original numbers was zero&quot;\r\n- add the result of this to a &quot;group of counters of non-zero numbers&quot; in a different SIMD register\r\n\r\nd) After all that (outside the loop):\r\n\r\n- calculate the count of negative numbers by doing a &quot;horizontal add&quot; of the &quot;group of counters of negative numbers&quot;\r\n\r\n- calculate the count of positive numbers by doing a &quot;horizontal add&quot; of the &quot;group of counters of non-zero numbers&quot;, then subtracting the count of negative numbers\r\n\r\n- calculate the count of zeros by doing &quot;zeros = all_numbers - negative_numbers - positive_numbers - padding_zeros&quot;\r\n\r\nOf course to do anything well you need inline assembly, which means that you&#39;ll want something like https://godoc.org/github.com/slimsag/rand/simd (that does the inline assembly for you in a nice portable way).\r\n\r\nNote 1: for large arrays/slices (but not small arrays/slices) you&#39;ll also want to use multiple CPUs in parallel (e.g. have N threads/goroutines if there&#39;s N CPUs, and split the array/slice into N pieces where each thread/goroutine does one piece, then add the counts from each piece before doing &quot;step d)&quot;).\r\n\r\nNote 2: For larger amounts of data; my algorithm is &quot;O(n)&quot;, and because your original algorithm is only &quot;O(n)&quot; I&#39;d expect my algorithm to be up to 100 times faster on modern hardware. However, for very small amounts of data, because &quot;O(n)&quot; is not linear, I&#39;d expect your algorithm to be faster than mine.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385366/whats-the-best-way-to-count-occurences-of-positive-negative-and-0-values-in-a/58386668#58386668","title":"What&#39;s the best way to count occurences of positive, negative, and 0 values in an unsorted array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":6504462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/56e79024241e45fe2f23ac310cf60d9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jukie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6504462/jukie"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":4,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571111501,"creation_date":1571096743,"question_id":58385366,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58385366","body_markdown":"The below works but how would I optimize this?

programmatic breakpoint\r\n    \r\n        print(&quot;say hello&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsing either of those 2 functions stops execution and &quot;say hello&quot; never gets printed.\r\n\r\nThe same way I was able to programmatically create the breakpoints is there a way that I can programmatically create something else so that the execution can continue after either of those 2 breakpoints is

I checked all of the uniform locations and none of them are negative so that shouldn&#39;t be the issue either.\r\n\r\nThe shader code:\r\n\r\n\t#version 400 core\r\n\t\r\n\tlayout(triangles) in;\r\n\tlayout(triangle_strip, max_vertices = 3) out;\r\n\t\r\n\tin vec3 passVertex[];\r\n\tin int passMtlIndex[]; // I don&#39;t have actual per-primitive values but I just use the first index in the array\r\n\t\r\n\tout vec4 color;\r\n\t\r\n\tstruct Material {\r\n\t\tvec3 ambient;\r\n\t\tvec3 diffuse;\r\n\t\tvec3 specular;\r\n\t\tfloat shininess;\r\n\t\tfloat dissolve;\r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n\tstruct Light {\r\n\t\tvec3 position;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tvec3 ambient;\r\n\t\tvec3 diffuse;\r\n\t\tvec3 specular;\r\n\t};\r\n\t\r\n\tuniform mat4 projection;\r\n\tuniform mat4 view;\r\n\t\r\n\tconst int MAX_MATERIALS = 10;\r\n\t\r\n\tuniform Material materials[MAX_MATERIALS];\r\n\tuniform Light light;\r\n\t\r\n\tvoid doVertex(int index, vec4 baseColor) {\r\n\t\tgl_Position = projection * view * vec4(passVertex[index], 1.0);\r\n\t\tcolor = baseColor;\r\n\t\tEmitVertex();\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tmat4 inverseAffine(mat4 matrix) {\r\n\t\treturn mat4(\r\n\t\t\t\tmatrix[0].x, matrix[1].x, matrix[2].x, 0,\r\n\t\t\t\tmatrix[0].y, matrix[1].y, matrix[2].y, 0,\r\n\t\t\t\tmatrix[0].z, matrix[1].z, matrix[2].z, 0,\r\n\t\t\t\t-dot(matrix[3].xyz, matrix[0].xyz), -dot(matrix[3].xyz, matrix[1].xyz), -dot(matrix[3].xyz, matrix[2].xyz), 1);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tvoid main() {\r\n\t\tvec3 toEye = normalize(inverseAffine(view)[3].xyz - passVertex[0]);\r\n\t\tvec3 norm = normalize(cross(passVertex[1] - passVertex[0], passVertex[2] - passVertex[0]));\r\n\t\tvec3 lightDir = normalize(light.position - passVertex[0]);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMaterial material = materials[passMtlIndex[0]];\r\n\t\r\n\t\tvec3 ambient = light.ambient * material.ambient;\r\n\t\r\n\t\tfloat diff = max(dot(norm, lightDir), 0.2);\r\n\t\tvec3 diffuse = light.diffuse * (diff * material.diffuse);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tfloat spec = pow(max(dot(reflect(-lightDir, norm), toEye), 0.0), material.shininess);\r\n\t\tvec3 specular = light.specular * (spec * material.specular);\r\n\t\r\n\t\tvec4 baseColor = vec4(ambient + diffuse + specular, material.dissolve);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tdoVertex(0, baseColor);\r\n\t\tdoVertex(1, baseColor);\r\n\t\tdoVertex(2, baseColor);\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tEndPrimitive();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nRendering code:\r\n\r\n    // use program\r\n    shader.loadMaterial(&quot;materials[0]&quot;, grassMtl);\r\n    shader.loadMaterial(&quot;materials[1]&quot;, dirtMtl);\r\n    // render\r\n\r\nShader code:\r\n\r\n    public void loadMaterial(String name, Material value) {\r\n\t\tloadVector(name + &quot;.ambient&quot;, value.getAmbient());\r\n\t\tloadVector(name + &quot;.diffuse&quot;, value.getDiffuse());\r\n\t\tloadVector(name + &quot;.specular&quot;, value.getSpecular());\r\n\t\tloadFloat(name + &quot;.shininess&quot;, value.getShininess());\r\n\t\tloadFloat(name + &quot;.dissolve&quot;, value.getDissolve());\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n    public void loadVector(String name, Vector3f value) {\r\n\t\tGL20.glUniform3f(GL20.glGetUniformLocation(programID, name), value.x, value.y, value.z);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic void loadFloat(String name, float value) {\r\n\t\tGL20.glUniform1f(GL20.glGetUniformLocation(programID, name), value);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI have actually tried to just pass two separate materials into the shader and this works just fine but for some reason the array is still not working.\r\n\r\nI also tried converting the array from a struct array to five arrays containing al of the members of the struct but that yields the same results (only the first element defined)\r\n\r\nAlso, how could I improve the line: &lt;code&gt;Material material = materials[passMtlIndex[0]];&lt;/code&gt;?

You just change the team name, jersey, color, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385321/tableview-reload-not-working-after-array-removeall-is-called-swift-5/58385714#58385714","title":"tableview.reload not working after array.removeAll() is called swift 5"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":7892147,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9df6862c15d02a586c618c4ff9d71e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SCS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7892147/scs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":28,"user_id":7892147,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f9df6862c15d02a586c618c4ff9d71e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SCS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7892147/scs"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58385714,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571115906,"creation_date":1571096306,"last_edit_date":1571097740,"question_id":58385321,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58385321","body_markdown":"i have a tableview that is not removing data from the cell after i remove all items from array and call tableview.reloadata, in the tableview cell i have a single label and the text stays\r\n\r\ngameScore is an instance of my class, that has a func to remove all items from array\r\n \r\n\r\n    func reset(winnerPlayer: String){\r\n            \r\n            let alertView = UIAlertController(title: &quot;Winner:&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;\\(winnerPlayer)&quot;, message: &quot;&quot;, preferredStyle: .alert)\r\n           \r\n            alertView.addAction(UIAlertAction(title: &quot;Restart&quot;, style: .destructive, handler: { action in\r\n                print(&quot;Tapped&quot;)\r\n               \r\n                self.gameScore.resetArrays()\r\n                \r\n                DispatchQueue.main.async {\r\n                    self.teamA_tableview.reloadData()\r\n                }\r\n         \r\n            }))\r\n\r\ni call the func using the delegate method on another viewcontroller\r\n\r\n    if teamA_totalScore &gt;= winningScore {\r\n                            print(&quot;Winner&quot;)\r\n                            self.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)\r\n                            delegate?.reset(winnerPlayer: (delegate?.gameScore.teamA_name)!)\r\n                           \r\n                        }\r\n                    }else{\r\n                        delegate?.teamA_totalScore.text = &quot;&quot;\r\n                    }\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is my popUp view controller where declare the Delegate\r\n\r\n    class PopUpViewController: UIViewController {\r\n        \r\n            @IBOutlet weak var whiteView: UIView!\r\n            @IBOutlet weak var teamsNameSegControl: UISegmentedControl!\r\n            @IBOutlet weak var pointsTextField: UITextField!\r\n            @IBOutlet weak var cancelButton: UIButton!\r\n            @IBOutlet weak var addButton: UIButton!\r\n        \r\n            var winningScore = Int()\r\n        \r\n            weak var delegate: GameScoreViewController?\r\n        \r\n          ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nthis is my gameScore view controller and where i set the delegate\r\n\r\n    override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {\r\n        if segue.identifier == &quot;toPopUp&quot;{\r\n            let popUpView = segue.destination as!

you index the `Controls` collection, you get back a `Control` reference.

I&#39;m trying to optimize a factorial function, for this particular test I&#39;m using 1e9! and I want the result modulo 1e9+7 so that it does not overflow. Firstly, I divided the number based on number_of_threads and assign to each thread their work respectively. I then do it normally and compare the times I get. It seems that when number_of_threads = 4, I get better results than the version without threads, which makes sense since my CPU has 4 cores. As expected, any number of threads greater than 4 has slower time compared to only 4. However, when doing it with less than 4 threads the results become way to big, for instance, with 1 threads I expect it to last the same as doing it without a thread + overhead. Without thread I get 6.2 seconds and 19.3 with 1 thread, which is way too much of a difference for it to be just the overhead.\r\n\r\nTo test why, I put some counter on the run method and it seems like, sometimes, the execution of only 1 cycle of the for inside of it takes more than a millisecond, and it shouldn&#39;t since it&#39;s just two operations plus the timer. \r\n        \r\n    public class Calc implements Runnable{\r\n        long min, max, mod, res;\r\n    \tRes r;\r\n    \tpublic Calc(long min, long max, long mod, Res r) {\r\n    \t\tthis.min = min;\r\n    \t\tthis.max = max;\r\n    \t\tthis.mod = mod;\r\n    \t\tres = 1;\r\n    \t\tthis.r = r;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic void run() {\r\n    \t\tfor(long i = min; i &lt;= max; i++) {\r\n    \t\t    res *= i;\r\n    \t\t\tres %= mod;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\tr.addup(res);\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Res{\r\n    \tlong result;\r\n    \tlong mod;\r\n    \tpublic Res(long mod) {\r\n    \t\tresult = 1;\r\n    \t\tthis.mod = mod;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic synchronized void addup(long add) {\r\n    \t\tresult *= add;\r\n    \t\tresult %= mod;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \tpublic long getResult() {\r\n    \t\treturn result;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class Main{\r\n    \tpublic static void main(String args[]) {\r\n    \t\tlong startTime = System.nanoTime();\r\n    \t\tfinal long factorial = 1000000000L;\r\n    \t\tfinal long modulo = 1000000007L;\r\n    \t\tRes res = new Res(modulo);\r\n    \t\tint number_of_threads = 1;\r\n    \t\tThread[] c = new Thread[number_of_threads];\r\n    \t\tlong min = 1, max = factorial/(long)number_of_threads;\r\n    \t\tlong cant = max;\r\n    \t\tfor(int i = 0; i &lt; number_of_threads; i++) {\r\n    \t\t\tif((long)i &lt; (factorial % number_of_threads))max++;\r\n    \t\t\tc[i] = new Thread(new Calc(min, max, modulo, res));\r\n    \t\t\tc[i].start();\r\n    \t\t\tmin = max +1;\r\n    \t\t\tmax += cant;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\tfor(int i = 0; i &lt; number_of_threads; i++) {\r\n    \t\t\ttry {\r\n    \t\t        c[i].join();\r\n    \t\t\t}catch (InterruptedException e) {\r\n    \t\t\t\t// TODO Auto-generated catch block\r\n    \t\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println(res.getResult());\r\n    \t\tlong endTime   = System.nanoTime();\r\n    \t\tlong totalTime = endTime - startTime;\r\n    \t\tSystem.out.println((double)totalTime/1000000000L);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen number_of_threads = 1 I get 19.3 seconds.

forgot to put the `self` in the method signature of `main()`. It should look like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def main(self):\r\n        self.square(3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout that, `self` is in fact not defined in the scope of your method, so Python complains.\r\n\r\nEDIT: also, as `Some programmer dude` mentions, your code never creates an instance of the class just executes main. There&#39;s also a problem with your indentation (probably a copy-paste error).\r\n\r\nTry this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Back(object):    \r\n    def square(self,x):\r\n        y = x * x\r\n        return y\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n    back = Back()\r\n    print(back.square(3))\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    main()\r\n```\r\n\r\nnotice how `main` is defined at the root level (it&#39;s not indented like `square`). It&#39;s not part of the class this way and doesn&#39;t need `self`. You could make it a method of the `Back` class again like this:\r\n```\r\nclass Back(object):    \r\n    def square(self,x):\r\n        y = x * x\r\n        return y\r\n\r\n    def main(self):\r\n        print(self.square(3))\r\n\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    back = Back()\r\n    back.main()\r\n```\r\nOk, this last one, it doesn&#39;t really make sens to do it this way, I admit. But I&#39;m just trying to illustrate scope and the difference between function and methods in python (I think this logic may help the OP more, considering the question).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385290/python-calling-a-function-from-another-function-in-a-class/58385322#58385322","title":"Python calling a function from another function in a class"}],"owner":{"reputation":462,"user_id":7789085,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3bab57a193bd4bb5793590f029892dd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fact","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7789085/fact"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58385322,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571097455,"creation_date":1571096041,"question_id":58385290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58385290","body_markdown":"I am trying to learn python and am having diccifulty in understanding why this class throws a error `NameError: name &#39;self&#39; is not defined` .I have followed https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5615648/python-call-function-within-class and added `self`, but this didn&#39;t help.

When I log what&#39;s returned from the web service endpoint (with toString()) I receive many &quot;instance of Tag&quot;, so there is data. But the build method of `_SideDrawerState` never seems to be called.\r\n\r\nWhat do I have to do so the items that are loaded from the web service are rendered?\r\n\r\np.s.\r\nThe final &quot;product&quot; shall be an initial virtual scrolling list of cards, on the side there should be a list of tags content is associated with, when I click on a tag it should filter content by tag slug, when I click on a card it should open a new view which should show content details.

Though the build script would be very large in one configure file, but much better than have hundreds build configuration files. \r\n\r\nBut the difficulty is these 100+ apps are all in one repository. This means all the normal method will not suitable for you, include using `Build.Repository.Name` value as the stage condition. Also, there&#39;s no more details *which describing the source file path* stored in the commit. \r\n\r\nSo, I suggest you and your team developers input the `project name` info into your commit message. Then, in the build pipeline you could use the variable `Build.SourceVersionMessage` to get its comment message. Since this is a environment variable which **only** work in **step level**(Not work for **stage level** and the **job level**), it needs you add one task in the first step and use the condition for it. \r\n\r\nThe logic of it is add one step as the first one in every stages. This step is only used to conditional judgment. If the `Build.SourceVersionMessage` matches the prefix or any key contents words, the jobs will be early-exit. \r\n\r\nIf use the condition like this:  \r\n\r\n    condition: startsWith(variables[&#39;Build.SourceVersionMessage&#39;], &#39;[maven-plugin]&#39;)\r\n\r\nIt needs your commit message must follow a strict content writing format, starting with the specified project name.\r\n\r\nAnother condition can for you consider is:\r\n\r\n    condition: in(variables[&#39;Build.SourceVersionMessage&#39;], &#39;maven-plugin&#39;)\r\n\r\nThis does not need the strict content writing format, but also need input the project name in the commit message. Thus it could be evaluated in the job condition with the above script.\r\n\r\nHope it could give you some help.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58385256/how-to-manage-pr-validation-builds-for-100-projects/58396707#58396707","title":"How to manage PR validation builds for 100+ projects"}],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":408312,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a18e0dd600eb1e3ebc522ed0ed440756?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/408312/james"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58396707,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571148722,"creation_date":1571095835,"question_id":58385256,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58385256","body_markdown":"We have 100+ services/apps in a repository in Azure Devops.
