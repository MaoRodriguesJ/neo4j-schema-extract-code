(local host is running in parallel as different solution within same project as client WinForms app).\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do on server side is to push message to hub from code like this:\r\n\r\n      var context = GlobalHost.ConnectionManager.GetHubContext&lt;NotificationHub&gt;();\r\n      context.Clients.All.broadcastMessage(&quot;NAM&quot;, &quot;New entry created.&quot;);\r\n\r\nIf I remove Wait() from: `hubConnection.Start();` I won&#39;t get Unauthorized 401 error, but I wouldn&#39;t get message value as well.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody sees what I am doing wrongly here?\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve tried so far:\r\n\r\n1. Trying to set up `EnableDetailedErrors` and `EnableJSONP` properties to true.

There is no `$arrNxm`, it should be `$array`.\r\n\r\n**Issue 4**\r\n\r\nFinally, this is wrong because you are putting the minimum value _back into_ the minimum position in the array:\r\n\r\n    $arrNxm[$intMinRow][$intMinCol] = $minIndex;\r\n    $arrNxm[$intMaxRow][$intMaxCol] = $maxIndex;\r\n\r\nYou just need to swap `$minIndex` and `$maxIndex` around:\r\n\r\n    $array[$intMinRow][$intMinCol] = $maxIndex;\r\n    $array[$intMaxRow][$intMaxCol] = $minIndex;\r\n\r\n**Full code**\r\n\r\nThe fully working code is:\r\n\r\n    $array = [\r\n      [45, 456, 321, 344, 567],\r\n      [100, 434, 173, 400, 789],\r\n      [191, 211, 457, 809, 900],\r\n      [431, 323, 432, 805, 906],\r\n      [708, 232, 897, 101, 696]\r\n    ];\r\n    \r\n    $intRows = 5;\r\n    $intCols = 5;\r\n    \r\n    $intMaxRow = $intMinRow = $intMaxCol = $intMinCol = 0;\r\n    \r\n    $minIndex = 100000;\r\n    $maxIndex = 1;\r\n    \r\n    for($row = 0; $row &lt; $intRows; $row++)\r\n    {\r\n      for($col = 0; $col &lt; $intCols; $col++)\r\n      {\r\n        if($array[$row][$col] &gt; $maxIndex)\r\n        {\r\n          $maxIndex = $array[$row][$col];\r\n          $intMaxRow = $row;\r\n          $intMaxCol = $col;\r\n        }\r\n        if($array[$row][$col] &lt; $minIndex)\r\n        {\r\n          $minIndex = $array[$row][$col];\r\n          $intMinRow = $row;\r\n          $intMinCol = $col;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    $array[$intMinRow][$intMinCol] = $maxIndex;\r\n    $array[$intMaxRow][$intMaxCol] = $minIndex;\r\n    \r\n    echo &quot;&lt;pre&gt;&quot;;\r\n    var_dump($array);\r\n    echo &quot;&lt;/pre&gt;&quot;;\r\n\r\nThis outputs:\r\n\r\n    array(5) {\r\n      [0]=&gt;\r\n      array(5) {\r\n        [0]=&gt;\r\n        int(906)\r\n        [1]=&gt;\r\n        int(456)\r\n        [2]=&gt;\r\n        int(321)\r\n        [3]=&gt;\r\n        int(344)\r\n        [4]=&gt;\r\n        int(567)\r\n      }\r\n      [1]=&gt;\r\n      array(5) {\r\n        [0]=&gt;\r\n        int(100)\r\n        [1]=&gt;\r\n        int(434)\r\n        [2]=&gt;\r\n        int(173)\r\n        [3]=&gt;\r\n        int(400)\r\n        [4]=&gt;\r\n        int(789)\r\n      }\r\n      [2]=&gt;\r\n      array(5) {\r\n        [0]=&gt;\r\n        int(191)\r\n        [1]=&gt;\r\n        int(211)\r\n        [2]=&gt;\r\n        int(457)\r\n        [3]=&gt;\r\n        int(809)\r\n        [4]=&gt;\r\n        int(900)\r\n      }\r\n      [3]=&gt;\r\n      array(5) {\r\n        [0]=&gt;\r\n        int(431)\r\n        [1]=&gt;\r\n        int(323)\r\n        [2]=&gt;\r\n        int(432)\r\n        [3]=&gt;\r\n        int(805)\r\n        [4]=&gt;\r\n        int(45)\r\n      }\r\n      [4]=&gt;\r\n      array(5) {\r\n        [0]=&gt;\r\n        int(708)\r\n        [1]=&gt;\r\n        int(232)\r\n        [2]=&gt;\r\n        int(897)\r\n        [3]=&gt;\r\n        int(101)\r\n        [4]=&gt;\r\n        int(696)\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhereby 45 and 906 are swapped in position as you wanted.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183745/how-to-swap-largest-and-smallest-number-in-multidimensional-array/58183892#58183892","title":"How to swap largest and smallest number in multidimensional array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12052089,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a90c4c3cd496d235868fd53e77507125?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Developer12345","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12052089/developer12345"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58183892,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569930047,"creation_date":1569928809,"question_id":58183745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183745","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a program that swaps largest and smallest number in multidimensional array.

So the observer is defaulting to the original One card filter type rather than the expected Two card filter type.\r\n\r\nThe same error occurs if the user chooses the Two card TextView first.  In this case, only the Two cards are shown in the View as expected.  The back space returns the user to the full List.  Then a click on the One TextView filters the List again but shows the Two cards rather than the expected One cards.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here?

not 100% sure about this. \r\n\r\nBut i think the culprit behind all this is the css being applied to :\r\n\r\n    &lt;li class=&quot;footer-nav__item footer-nav__item--separator&quot;&gt;&#183;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n\r\nWhich is \r\n\r\n    .footer-nav__item--separator {\r\n       font-size: 3em;\r\n       line-height: 0.5em;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDefault font size : `16px`\r\n\r\n\r\nNow to know how much height our text is going to require we multiply the `font-size` by the `line-height` (em,rem,px or any other unit doesn&#39;t matter on the line height)\r\n\r\n\r\n    3em * 16px = 48px // Size of the character \r\n    48px * .5 = 24px  // The height of the text\r\n\r\nAs you can see the character is much more bigger than the height, so it will spill out and cause a scrollbar to appear.\r\n\r\nSolutions:\r\n\r\n  1.

So value watcher handler is executed. In your handler you try to set the value with jQuery:\r\n\r\n```javaScript\r\nwatch: {\r\n    value: function (value) {\r\n      // update value\r\n      $(this.$el).val(value)\r\n    },...\r\n```\r\nBut it doesn&#39;t work because this action doesn&#39;t fire `change` event. So Vue doesn&#39;t render any changes.\r\n\r\nTo fix it fire `change` event explicitly:\r\n\r\n```javaScript\r\n watch: {\r\n    value: function (value) {\r\n      // update value\r\n      $(this.$el).val(value).trigger(&#39;change&#39;)\r\n    },...\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI also noticed in your demo that your `select` elements are not initialized correctly. You pass:\r\n```javaScript\r\nmySelects: [\r\n      {label: &#39;first&#39;, val: 1},\r\n      {label: &#39;second&#39;, val: 2},\r\n      {label: &#39;third&#39;, val: 3}\r\n    ],...\r\n```\r\nSo, in the first `select` value 1 must be selected, in the second - value 2, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are two steps to fix it:\r\n\r\n1. trigger `change` event explicitly after you set the value\r\n2. set the value after passing options\r\n\r\n```javaScript\r\n mounted: function () {\r\n    var vm = this\r\n    $(this.$el)\r\n    // first pass the options\r\n      .select2({ data: this.options })\r\n    // and then set the value\r\n      .val(this.value)\r\n    // trigger change event explicitly to let Vue know that it has to update DOM\r\n      .trigger(&#39;change&#39;)\r\n    // emit event on change.\r\n      .on(&#39;change&#39;, function () {\r\n        vm.$emit(&#39;input&#39;, this.value)\r\n      })\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183596/select-2-markup-moving-to-previous-row/58187358#58187358","title":"Select 2 markup moving to previous row"}],"owner":{"reputation":158,"user_id":7369522,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03634ebb126afa5bfac565075ecbde18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"steve ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7369522/steve"},"last_editor":{"reputation":158,"user_id":7369522,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03634ebb126afa5bfac565075ecbde18?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"steve ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7369522/steve"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569942211,"creation_date":1569928216,"last_edit_date":1569928815,"question_id":58183596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58183596","body_markdown":"I have a vuejs application that loops though an array and outputs a multitude of select2 elements.

So why do the echos not doing the following?\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $wp_query-&gt;max_num_pages /* Should return 2 because I have 11 posts with 10 per page */\r\necho $wp_query-&gt;found_posts   /* Shoudl return 11 because I have 11 posts */\r\n```\r\n\r\nTried the following to see if this would work\r\n```\r\n  add_action( &#39;pre_get_posts&#39;, &#39;action_pre_get_posts&#39; );\r\n  function action_pre_get_posts( $q ) \r\n  {\r\n    $q-&gt;set(&#39;max_num_pages&#39;, 20);\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when navigating to `page/2/` I still get a 404 page.\r\n\r\nThe url I am hitting is `/category-name/page/2` which returns a `404`.\r\n\r\nThere must be a solution to this?\r\n\r\nHow do I make my site ignore the default WordPress post types and use what I actually define, the `wpdmpro` post types?\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nI have tried to use the `WP_Query` class too, but still hitting a 404 page when navigating to `/page/2`\r\n\r\nJust a few things to add in case they are somehow linked.\r\n\r\nIn my permalinks settings, I have a custom structure of\r\n```\r\n/%category%/%postname%/\r\n```\r\nand my default category base is `.`\r\n\r\nIn my WP Download Manager Settings, my `WPDM Category URL Base` is `.`\r\n\r\nI also have these 2 filter functions, that were copied from answers on here, and I am quite new to Wordpress so I am not sure of the potential repercussions of

Enabling the quiet period would prevent a build from being started as soon as Jenkins discovers the first commit; this would give the developer the chance to push more commits which would be included in the build when it starts. This reduces the size of the queue, meaning that developers would get feedback faster for their series of commits, and the load on the Jenkins system would be reduced.\r\nIf a new build of this project is triggered while a build is already sitting in the queue, waiting for its quiet period to end, the quiet period will not be reset.

to create a ceaser cipher in Ruby.\r\nThe problem I&#39;m facing is that when the program reaches the while loop, it only performs the desired operation on the very last letter of the inputted word. Before I delve further into what I&#39;ve tried, please find  the code: \r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/ruby\r\n\r\n\r\n#print 65.chr  ASCII code for A\r\n#print 97.chr  ASCII code for a\r\n\r\na = 0\r\nb = 97\r\nd = []\r\ne = 0\r\n\r\n# Just to print the alphabet alongside the ASCII value \r\n# (For sanity checking)\r\n\r\nwhile a &lt;= 25\r\n  print b.chr + &quot; &quot;\r\n  print b.to_s + &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n  a = a + 1\r\n  b = b + 1\r\nend\r\n\r\nputs &quot;\\n Please enter a word to translate&quot;\r\nword = gets.strip\r\n\r\n# The desired effect is to move the letter along by key value\r\n\r\nputs &quot;Please enter a key&quot;\r\nk = gets.chomp.to_i\r\n\r\n# In its current state, what happens is only the last char\r\n# is moved along by the key value. \r\n\r\nwhile e &lt;= word.length\r\n  word.each_byte do |c|\r\n    d[e] = c + k\r\n  end\r\n  e = e + 1\r\nend\r\n\r\n\r\nputs d\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m thinking that the problem lies with the logic for the while loop. The way I am going to attack this is by reading the pre-converted word into an array, as opposed to using the .each_byte object. \r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to do that and the guides/questions I&#39;ve found don&#39;t quite answer the question. If anyone knows how to do this, or knows a better way of solving this- I&#39;d be much appreciative.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58183522/reading-word-into-an-array-ruby","title":"Reading word into an array [ruby]"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7926}
