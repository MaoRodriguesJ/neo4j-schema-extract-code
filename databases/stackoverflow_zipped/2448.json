The thing is there is critical bug in production app and I need to fix it, I made a copy of the application and deployed to IIS in default websites. The problem is when I make changes to html or js it&#39;s not showing up, its returning the old html/js. Since I cannot debug it I am using alerts. For example I set alert text to &#39;update 1&#39; then make changes and then increment it to &#39;update 2&#39; but I am still getting &#39;update 1&#39; and none of the changes. I have tried the following\r\n\r\n1) refeshing the web page\r\n\r\n2) refreshing the web page with ctr+shift+r\r\n\r\n3) try with another browser\r\n\r\n4) try on different device\r\n\r\nAt this point I figured it might be IIS issue and I tried the following\r\n\r\n1) changing web.config (i.e. when web.config changes even if you add space IIS should get latest version)\r\n\r\n2) set clientCache to 0\r\n\r\n    &lt;staticContent&gt;\r\n      &lt;clientCache cacheControlMode=&quot;UseMaxAge&quot; cacheControlMaxAge=&quot;0.00:00:00&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/staticContent\r\n3) refreshing the application from IIS\r\n\r\nI deleted contents of home page html/js doing so should throw exception but the app is working as before.

You can do that through your browser&#39;s developer tools (&lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Shift&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;E&lt;/kbd&gt; if you&#39;re using Firefox):\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nIf you go through the `Headers` and the `Params` of the request you will see how the url, the body and the headers should look like.

need to store and restore a vector with elements of different size and want to adjust my solution to get this working. The goal is to get a size of the data in bytes + get a void pointer to the beginning of the data.\r\n\r\nI use a template class in my code and combine solution 1 and 2 in it, but for the sake of simplicity I split the code up in this question.\r\n\r\n**1) Solution for a vector of elements where all elements have the same size:**\r\n\r\n*1.1) Save a vector as raw data - with fixed size elements, e.g. int:*\r\n\r\n    std::vector&lt;int&gt; data;\r\n    Sint32 size = sizeof(int) * vec.size();\r\n    void* tdata = static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;vec[0]);\r\n    // tdata points to the raw data =&gt; I can work with this now and save it to my memory structure (tdata + size is saved there) \r\n\r\n*1.2) Restore a vector from raw data - with fixed size elements, e.g. int:*\r\n\r\n    std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec;\r\n\tsize_t size = ...; // received from my memory structure\r\n\tvoid* tdata = ...; // received from my memory structure\r\n\r\n    int count = size / sizeof(int);\r\n\tvec.resize(count);\r\n\tmemcpy(&amp;vec[0], tdata, size);\r\n    // vec contains count elements of type int now\r\n\r\n**2) Solution for a vector of elements where all elements have dynamic sizes:**\r\n\r\nI simply define two helper interfaces/classes to get the size of all elements inside the vector:\r\n\r\n    class ObjectWithSize\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic:\r\n            // eg. for an int + char*: sizeof(int) + strlen(text) + 1\r\n\t\t\tvirtual int getRawSize() = 0; \r\n\t};\r\n\r\n    class RawDataWithCount\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tpublic:\r\n\t\t\tint count;\r\n\t\t\tvoid* data;\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n*2.1) Save a vector of dynamic elements:*\r\n\r\n    Sint32 datasize = 0;\r\n\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; vec.size(); i++) \r\n\t    datasize += vec.at(i).getRawSize();\r\n    RawDataWithCount data = RawDataWithCount();\r\n\tdata.count = vec.size();\r\n\tdata.data = static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;vec[0]);\r\n\tvoid* tdata = static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(&amp;data);\r\n    // tdata points to the raw data =&gt; I can work with this now and save it to my memory structure (tdata + datasize is saved there) \r\n\r\n*2.2) Restore a vector of dynamic elements*\r\n\r\n    std::vector&lt;T&gt; vec;\r\n\tsize_t size = ...; // received from my memory structure\r\n\tvoid* tdata = ...; // received from my memory structure\r\n    RawDataWithCount* data = reinterpret_cast&lt;RawDataWithCount*&gt;(tdata);\r\n    int count = data-&gt;count;\r\n\tvec.resize(count);\r\n    memcpy(&amp;vec[0], data-&gt;data, size);\r\n\r\n**Information**\r\n\r\nSolution 1 is used for a long time already and works quite good, solution 2 will be an extension of it for the future. I think, 2.1 is save to use, but when it comes to 2.2 I&#39;m not sure anymore, so here comes the question. Tests show that solution 2 seems to work, but I want to know if it is save.\r\n\r\n**Question**\r\n\r\nIs it save to do following in 2.2\r\n\r\n    vec.resize(count);\r\n    memcpy(&amp;vec[0], data-&gt;data, size);\r\n\r\nif the elements of `vec` do not all have the same size? I assume not, but I&#39;m unsure here. If this is not save, maybe someone has a better suggestion? (I know I can manually solve this by simple creating a raw data in 2.1 with number of elements followed by a list of size/element, then parsing back elements 1 by 1 in 2.2 and fill up the vector with this data, but maybe (like in case 1)\r\n there is a more simple solution with the help of a vector?)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954118/setting-raw-data-of-array-with-elements-of-dynamic-size-vector-to-from-void","title":"Setting raw data of array with elements of dynamic

slightly off in the assumption that SQL Server triggers are per-column; the [CREATE TRIGGER](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-trigger-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017) syntax binds the trigger to the named table for the specified operations. The trigger will be called with two logical tables in scope (`inserted` &amp; `deleted`) that contain the rows modified by the operation that caused the trigger to fire; if you wanted to check for specific columns&#39; values or changes, then the trigger logic would need to operate against those logical tables.\r\n\r\nIf you take this approach, you will need to create a trigger for each table you wish to monitor in this fashion; we&#39;ve had a similar need to track changes (at a more granular level), we didn&#39;t find a &quot;pseudotable&quot; that corresponds to all tables in a schema/database. You should also be aware that locking semantics will come into play by doing this, as you will have triggers from multiple tables all targeting the same row for an update as part of separate operations -- depending on the concurrency model in effect, you could be looking at performance consequences by doing so if you expect multiple DML queries to operate concurrently against your database.\r\n\r\nI would suggest checking Arvo&#39;s commented link above for suitability instead; querying system views is more likely to avoid contention (and other performance-related) issues from using triggers in your scenario.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954116/sql-trigger-on-update-insert-delete-on-non-specific-row-column-or-table/57954534#57954534","title":"SQL Trigger on Update, Insert, Delete on non-specific row, column, or table"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11697982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5f770dc150749ca0ebae5492a5e69ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlexSNorth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11697982/alexsnorth"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568644447,"creation_date":1568644447,"answer_id":57959082,"question_id":57954116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57959082","body_markdown":"After a bunch more digging on the internet and keep finding opposite results of what I was looking for, and a bunch of trial and error, I found a solution.\r\nFirst and foremost: having triggers not being dependent on a table (aka, the trigger activates for **every** table is impossible, it cannot be done, which is too bad, it would&#39;ve been nice to keep this out of the program code, but nothing I can do about it.\r\n\r\nSecond: the issue for updates on not being column specific was an error due to my part for searching for triggers not being dependent on specific columns only giving me examples for triggers that are.\r\nThe following solution works for MySQL, I have yet to test this on SQL Server, but I expect it to not be too different.\r\n```mysql\r\nCREATE TRIGGER [tablename]_last_modified_insert\r\n   AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ON [db].[tablename]\r\n     FOR EACH ROW\r\n     BEGIN\r\n        INSERT INTO [db].last_modified(last_modified_on)\r\n        VALUES(current_timestamp())\r\n     END\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for dynamically creating these triggers, the following show how I get it to work:\r\nFirst Query:\r\n```mysql\r\nSHOW TABLES\r\n```\r\nI run the above query to get all the tables in the database, exclude the `last_modified` I made myself, and loop through all of them, creating 3 triggers for each.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954116/sql-trigger-on-update-insert-delete-on-non-specific-row-column-or-table/57959082#57959082","title":"SQL Trigger on Update, Insert, Delete on non-specific row, column, or table"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6055,"user_id":1750324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3eea6f502a6e4334864b2d0f47181db2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steve Ford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1750324/steve-ford"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568644906,"creation_date":1568644906,"answer_id":57959224,"question_id":57954116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57959224","body_markdown":"Perhaps you could use Audit for SQL Server:\r\n\r\n    CREATE SERVER AUDIT [ServerAuditName]\r\n    TO FILE\r\n    (\r\n       FILEPATH = N&#39;C:\\Program Files......&#39;\r\n    )\r\n    ALTER SERVER AUDIT [ServerAuditName] WITH (STATE=ON)\r\n    GO   \r\n    CREATE DATABASE AUDIT SPECIFICATION [mySpec]\r\n    FOR SERVER AUDIT [ServerAuditName]\r\n    ADD (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON DATABASE::databasename BY [public])\r\n    WITH (STATE=ON)\r\n    GO\r\n\r\nThen you can query for changes:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM sys.fn_get_audit_file (&#39;C:\\Program Files......&#39;,default,default);\r\n    GO  \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954116/sql-trigger-on-update-insert-delete-on-non-specific-row-column-or-table/57959224#57959224","title":"SQL Trigger on Update, Insert, Delete on non-specific row, column, or table"}],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11697982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5f770dc150749ca0ebae5492a5e69ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlexSNorth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11697982/alexsnorth"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11697982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5f770dc150749ca0ebae5492a5e69ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"AlexSNorth","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11697982/alexsnorth"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57959082,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568644906,"creation_date":1568626766,"last_edit_date":1568644714,"question_id":57954116,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57954116","body_markdown":"I have several databases that are used by several applications (one of which is our own, the others we have no control over in what they do).\r\n\r\nOut software has to know when the database has last been changed. For reasons I won&#39;t get into to keep this short we decided that going with a new table per database that has a singular field: `last_changed_on` that has a `GetDate()` as a value. This way our own software can check when it was last changed and check it to the date it has stored for said database and do things if the date is newer than what is stored in-memory.\r\n\r\nAfter doing some research we decided that working with **Triggers** was the way to go, but from what I could find online, triggers look at specific columns that you set for Updates.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;d like to know is if there is a way to automate the process or just have a trigger that happens whenever anything happens *insert, update, remove* wise?\r\n\r\nSo I am looking for something like this:\r\n```mysql\r\nCREATE TRIGGER LastModifiedTrigger\r\nON [dbo].[anytable]\r\nAFTER INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE\r\nAS\r\n\r\n   INSERT INTO dbo.LastModifiedTable (last_modified_on) VALUES (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that the above example isn&#39;t a correct trigger, I&#39;m rather new to them so I was unsure on how to word it.\r\nIt might be interesting to note that I can have my own software run several queries creating the queries automatically for each table and each column, but I&#39;d rather avoid to do that as keeping track of all those triggers will be a pain in the long run.\r\nI&#39;d prefer to have a little triggers per database as possible, if only by not having to make a trigger for each individual column name.\r\n\r\n*Edit: To clarify: I am trying to avoid having to create an automated script that goes and scans every table, and sequentially every column of every table, to create a trigger to see if something is changed there. My biggest issue at the moment is the trigger behavior on `updates`, but I&#39;m hoping to avoid having to specify tables as well for `insert` and `delete`*\r\n\r\n*Edit 2: To avoid future confusion, I&#39;m looking for a solution to this problem for both SQL Server (MS SQL/T SQL) and MySQL*\r\n\r\n***Edit 3: Turns out that I read the documentation very wrongly and (at least on MySql) the trigger activates on any given updated column without having to define a specific one. Regardless, I&#39;m still wondering if there is a way to just have less triggers than having one for each table in a database. (i.e. 1 for any type of `update()`, 1 for any type of `insert()`, and 1 for any type of `delete()`***\r\n\r\n***EDIT 4: Forgot that the argument for overwriting 1 field will come with performance issues, I&#39;ve considered this and I&#39;m now working with multiple rows. I&#39;ve also handled the creating of 3 triggers (`insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()`) for each database through my software&#39;s code, I really wished this could&#39;ve been avoided, but it cannot.***\r\n\r\n#Solution\r\nAfter a bunch more digging on the internet and keep finding opposite results of what I was looking for, and a bunch of trial and error, I found a solution.\r\nFirst and foremost: having triggers not being dependent on a table (aka, the trigger activates for **every** table is impossible, it cannot be done, which is too bad, it would&#39;ve been nice to keep this out of the program code, but nothing I can do about it.\r\n\r\nSecond: the issue for updates on not being column specific was an error due to my part for searching for triggers not being dependent on specific columns only giving me examples for triggers that are.\r\nThe following solution works for MySql, I have yet to test this on SQL Server, but I expect it to not be too different.\r\n```mysql\r\nCREATE TRIGGER [tablename]_last_modified_insert\r\n   AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE ON [db].[tablename]\r\n     FOR EACH ROW\r\n     BEGIN\r\n        INSERT INTO [db].last_modified(last_modified_on)\r\n        VALUES(current_timestamp())\r\n     END\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs for dynamically creating these triggers, the following show how I get it to work:\r\nFirst Query:\r\n```mysql\r\nSHOW TABLES\r\n```\r\nI run the above query to get all the tables in the database, exclude the `last_modified` I made myself, and loop through all of them, creating 3 triggers for each.\r\n\r\nA big thank you to Arvo and T2PS for their replies, their comments helped by pointing me in the right direction and writing up the solution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954116/sql-trigger-on-update-insert-delete-on-non-specific-row-column-or-table","title":"SQL Trigger on Update, Insert, Delete on non-specific row, column, or table"},{"tags":["gis","qgis"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12070710,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBBDdrBH0KHCdzVVzHMfxZOLKm0XvnswC7dL9Yx=k-s128","display_name":"Tam Huynh Thanh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12070710/tam-huynh-thanh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568983799,"post_id":58000844,"comment_id":102459760,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954114/have-qgis-supported-to-return-json-as-a-web-service/58000844#comment102459760_58000844"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":3476750,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mI3jf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alphabetasoup","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3476750/alphabetasoup"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841486,"creation_date":1568841486,"answer_id":58000844,"question_id":57954114,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000844","body_markdown":"[QGIS Server](https://docs.qgis.org/3.4/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/server/index.html#label-qgisserver) is an implementation of various OGC web service standards that you can use.

Data received from the ECR has a format that contains a unique ID that corresponds to an app. I was thinking of the best way to handle this, and I came up with two ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Each app that needs to receive or send data to the ECR would implement a Service that&#160; would constantly poll for data coming in via serial port. Ideally, the Service would &quot;run forever&quot;. Based on this [post](https://fabcirablog.weebly.com/blog/creating-a-never-ending-background-service-in-android), I already made a long-running&#160; Service that can listen for serial port data. However, I have doubts that this approach would still work if multiple apps have their own Services that does the same thing. Also, I&#39;m worried that Android might decide to stop the running Services in case of low memory. \r\n\r\n2. We are also developing a launcher app, so I was thinking that instead of each app listening for data from the ECR, the launcher app would be the only one in charge of listening for the data and routing the received data to the appropriate app. A problem to this approach is that the launcher app should be able to map the message&#39;s app ID and the corresponding package name of the app to be started.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best approach?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954108/whats-the-best-approach-so-that-multiple-apps-can-receive-data-coming-in-from-s","title":"What&#39;s the best approach so that multiple apps can receive data coming in from serial port?"},{"tags":["excel","excel-formula"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2323,"user_id":11768364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kK8lw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Terry W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11768364/terry-w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568698950,"post_id":57954107,"comment_id":102346164,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954107/how-to-sum-2-cells-with-value-like-9-1-and-10-2#comment102346164_57954107"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":10949605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18cc4a661a9e39d128b30ee9efbc834e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949605/stephane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568627821,"post_id":57954288,"comment_id":102320803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954107/how-to-sum-2-cells-with-value-like-9-1-and-10-2/57954288#comment102320803_57954288"},{"owner":{"reputation":13469,"user_id":9758194,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2eG6f.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JvdV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758194/jvdv"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":70,"user_id":10949605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18cc4a661a9e39d128b30ee9efbc834e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949605/stephane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568627906,"post_id":57954288,"comment_id":102320853,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954107/how-to-sum-2-cells-with-value-like-9-1-and-10-2/57954288#comment102320853_57954288"},{"owner":{"reputation":70,"user_id":10949605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18cc4a661a9e39d128b30ee9efbc834e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949605/stephane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568628185,"post_id":57954288,"comment_id":102321022,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954107/how-to-sum-2-cells-with-value-like-9-1-and-10-2/57954288#comment102321022_57954288"},{"owner":{"reputation":3746,"user_id":9199828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UAYJV4Qkm7s/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/K2l8qCDDfVc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Foxfire And Burns And Burns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9199828/foxfire-and-burns-and-burns"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":70,"user_id":10949605,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18cc4a661a9e39d128b30ee9efbc834e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10949605/stephane"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568629767,"post_id":57954288,"comment_id":102321869,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954107/how-to-sum-2-cells-with-value-like-9-1-and-10-2/57954288#comment102321869_57954288"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13469,"user_id":9758194,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2eG6f.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JvdV","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9758194/jvdv"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568627417,"creation_date":1568627417,"answer_id":57954288,"question_id":57954107,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57954288","body_markdown":"Probably multiple ways but you could try:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nFormula in `B1`:\r\n\r\n    =SUMPRODUCT(LEFT(A1:A2,SEARCH(&quot;(&quot;,A1:A2)-1)*1)&amp;&quot;

I would prefer to do it using externally connected functionality, but happy to keep testing this method and run with it if it works.\r\n \r\n**Update 2:**\r\nThis code finally works for me:\r\n\r\nIn my content script-\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;, function(event) {\r\n        // We only accept messages from ourselves\r\n        if (event.source != window)\r\n            return;\r\n    \r\n        //if (event.data.type &amp;&amp; (event.data.type == &quot;FROM_PAGE&quot;)) {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Content script received: &quot;);\r\n        console.log(event.data);\r\n        //}\r\n    }, false);\r\n\r\nAnd in my injected script:\r\n\r\n    async function sendMessageToPlugin(dataToSend) {\r\n        console.log(&#39;Send to plugin&#39;);        \r\n        window.postMessage(dataToSend, &quot;*&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI am sure Jafar&#39;s solution will work as well (I will try it and update!), but for now I am sticking with this one. Thank you Jafar for taking out time to reply!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954085/making-message-passing-work-in-chrome-with-injected-javascript","title":"Making message passing work in Chrome With Injected Javascript"},{"tags":["javascript","regex","replace"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11911501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5jmtaZrYq1w/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc0_avYdYeA1KsonwXjEngzdXbpbQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ian ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11911501/ian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568627716,"post_id":57954215,"comment_id":102320749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954084/javascript-string-replace-callback-to-check-at-every-other-line/57954215#comment102320749_57954215"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138063,"user_id":9515207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34932d3e923ffad9a4a1423e30b1d9fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"CertainPerformance","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9515207/certainperformance"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568627156,"creation_date":1568627156,"answer_id":57954215,"question_id":57954084,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57954215","body_markdown":"To do this with `.replace` *alone*, without anything else, would be a bit tricky.

(Escaping makes sense if you want to prevent the user to enter an expression, which is what `FTLStringLiteralEnc` did.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954021/escaping-macro-parameter-value-in-freemarker/57962673#57962673","title":"Escaping macro parameter value in Freemarker"}],"owner":{"reputation":1890,"user_id":1063673,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1e67c95c89704f9d49b73538dc3f36c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Steffen Harbich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1063673/steffen-harbich"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568960569,"creation_date":1568626397,"question_id":57954021,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57954021","body_markdown":"Consider the following macro\r\n\r\n    &lt;#macro subject text&gt;\r\n    ${_mail.setSubject(text)}\r\n    &lt;/#macro&gt;\r\n\r\nand example usages:\r\n\r\n    &lt;@mail.subject text=&quot;MyEmailSubject124&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;@mail.subject text=&quot;${initiator!&#39;&lt;unknown&gt;&#39;}: Subject with interpolation&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, my application should be able to write specific Freemarker template files including lines with that macro.

this question is tagged with `google-app-engine`, I assume it is the product you are using to deploy your application. In this case:\r\n\r\nApp Engine uses a Unix socket to connect to a Cloud SQL instance, because of that you need to pass the instance&#39;s connection name, like in the example below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var con = mysql.createConnection({\r\n      host: &quot;localhost&quot;,\r\n      socketPath: &quot;/cloudsql/&lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;:&lt;REGION&gt;:&lt;SQL_INSTANCE_NAME&gt;&quot;,\r\n      user: &quot;root&quot;,\r\n      password: &quot;secret&quot;\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    con.connect(function(err) {\r\n      if (err) throw err;\r\n      console.log(&quot;Connected!&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can actually test that by running the cloud_sql_proxy locally and connecting through the unix socket. The [Using Cloud SQL for MySQL][1] tutorial explains how to do that.\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nIn case you are using App Engine Flex, it is also important to set the correct beta_settings on your **app.yaml** like in the example below:\r\n\r\n    beta_settings:\r\n      # The connection name of your instance, available by using\r\n      # &#39;gcloud beta sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME]&#39; or from\r\n      # the Instance details page in the Google Cloud Platform Console.\r\n      cloud_sql_instances: YOUR_INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME\r\n\r\n[1]: https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/nodejs/using-cloud-sql\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954004/nodejs-app-cannot-connect-to-google-mysql-data-instance/57958313#57958313","title":"nodeJS app cannot connect to google MySQL data instance"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11527744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IMWXBZjUhHA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reASKOMTAG9un-neGFBEJOqqIOYkA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Athish Murugan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11527744/athish-murugan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568642614,"creation_date":1568642614,"answer_id":57958547,"question_id":57954004,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57958547","body_markdown":"Your local machine sql server can&#39;t be connected to the google console as it is not\r\nexposed to the internet.You should host your mssql db in some platform and then you \r\ncan connect with that in google console","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954004/nodejs-app-cannot-connect-to-google-mysql-data-instance/57958547#57958547","title":"nodeJS app cannot connect to google MySQL data instance"}],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":5793010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5e2m3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"S.Hettz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5793010/s-hettz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":54,"user_id":5793010,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5e2m3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"S.Hettz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5793010/s-hettz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57958313,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568821607,"creation_date":1568626321,"last_edit_date":1568801202,"question_id":57954004,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57954004","body_markdown":"I hosted a nodeJS application in google console under a paid account.

It will actually be run **always when your system is booted/rebooted** and **it may happen**. It will be also run **each time when cron daemon is restarted** so you need to rely on that **&quot;typically it should not happen&quot;** on your system...\r\n\r\nThere are far more certain ways to ensure that a `CronJob` will never be run:\r\n\r\n1. *On Kubernetes level* by [suspending][1] a job by setting its `.spec.suspend` field to `true`\r\n\r\nYou can easily set it using patch:\r\n\r\n    kubectl patch cronjobs &lt;job-name&gt; -p &#39;{&quot;spec&quot; : {&quot;suspend&quot; : true }}&#39;\r\n\r\n2. *On Cron level.* Use a trick based on fact that **crontab** syntax is not strictly validated and set a date that you can be sure will never happen like 31th of February. **Cron** will accept that as it doesn&#39;t check `day of the month` in relation to value set in a `month` field. It just requires that you put valid numbers in both fields (`1-31` and `1-12` respectively). You can set it to something like:\r\n\r\n`* * 31 2 *`\r\n\r\nwhich for **Cron** is perfectly valid value but we know that such a date is impossible and it will never happen.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/#suspend","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954002/schedule-cron-job-to-never-happen/57957907#57957907","title":"Schedule cron job to never happen?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2283,"user_id":7641078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB95H.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Eduardo Baitello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7641078/eduardo-baitello"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1568666684,"post_id":57960037,"comment_id":102339359,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954002/schedule-cron-job-to-never-happen/57960037#comment102339359_57960037"},{"owner":{"reputation":563,"user_id":10615691,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aYOwF1msSVI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABrQ/uCErvj337f4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"switchboard.op","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10615691/switchboard-op"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2283,"user_id":7641078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB95H.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Eduardo Baitello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7641078/eduardo-baitello"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568668022,"post_id":57960037,"comment_id":102339811,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954002/schedule-cron-job-to-never-happen/57960037#comment102339811_57960037"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":563,"user_id":10615691,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-aYOwF1msSVI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABrQ/uCErvj337f4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"switchboard.op","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10615691/switchboard-op"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568647562,"creation_date":1568647562,"answer_id":57960037,"question_id":57954002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57960037","body_markdown":"```yaml\r\nkind: CronJob\r\nspec:\r\n    suspend: true\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57954002/schedule-cron-job-to-never-happen/57960037#57960037","title":"Schedule cron job to never happen?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4415,"user_id":1283776,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/abb815001c365007d50d2bdb3226e70a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1283776","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1283776/user1283776"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57957907,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568647562,"creation_date":1568626318,"question_id":57954002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57954002","body_markdown":"Here is part of my CronJob spec:\r\n\r\n    kind: CronJob\r\n    spec:\r\n        schedule: #{service.schedule}\r\n\r\nFor a specific environment a cron job is set up, but I never want it to run.

Fortitudinis quaedam praecepta sunt ac paene leges, quae effeminari virum vetant in dolore. Hic Speusippus, hic Xenocrates, hic eius auditor Polemo, cuius illa ipsa sessio fuit, quam videmus.\r\n        Sed fortuna fortis; Itaque eos id agere, ut a se dolores, morbos, debilitates repellant. Idem fecisset Epicurus, si sententiam hanc, quae nunc Hieronymi est, coniunxisset cum Aristippi vetere sententia. An dolor longissimus quisque miserrimus, voluptatem\r\n        non optabiliorem diuturnitas facit? Dici enim nihil potest verius. An tu me de L. Primum quid tu dicis breve?

Si verbum sequimur, primum longius verbum praepositum quam bonum. Ne tum quidem te respicies et cogitabis sibi quemque natum esse et suis voluptatibus?

Rather, they are part of the network configuration on the computer. You may feel tempted to use application code to alter the network configuration, but this is almost always a very bad idea.\r\n\r\nTo set the correct route in your network configuration, you need to know the IP address of your service (this kinda sucks, since often you only start out with a host name, and the IP address might even be dynamic in the case of cloud services). You must also know the network address for connection A. The network address is different from the gateway IP address, and typically ends with a `0` (though it is possible to construct network subnets with different network addresses).\r\n\r\nOnce you add the route, connections on the computer targeting your service&#39;s address will see this new route is more specific than the default gateways at A or B, and therefore always choose it. \r\n\r\nA common use for routes is forcing certain traffic to pass over a special connection, such as a VPN.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows/adding-a-tcpip-route-to-the-windows-routing-table/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57953972/how-can-i-connect-to-the-net-through-a-specific-ip-if-my-pc-has-multiple-ip/57963364#57963364","title":"How can I connect to the net through a specific IP if my pc has multiple IP?"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":5686314,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SimxH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"M-Corp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5686314/m-corp"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14068,"user_id":3088349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f5cbe13d76e559198ea6857799b044b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"maytham-ɯɐɥʇʎɐɯ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3088349/maytham-%c9%af%c9%90%c9%a5%ca%87%ca%8e%c9%90%c9%af"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57963155,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568663170,"creation_date":1568626199,"last_edit_date":1568661808,"question_id":57953972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57953972","body_markdown":"I have a desktop that has two Ethernet ports and each port connects to a different network(network A, network B). \r\n\r\nI have a C# application that needs to run on this desktop and needs to access the net.

So what this code does is randomly a number from 0 to the number of how many elements the artist&#39;s list has. It then chooses an artist using the random number, it catches the number used with index so that it can be used on the songs array to get the corresponding song (I know very bad) It pitches the question and shows the first letter of the song. If you get the song you get the same code again but with the prior song and artist removed to prevent dupes. That&#39;s where the problem comes in, when usually running the code it&#39;ll randomly give me the error where the element I&#39;m trying to output is not in the list:\r\n\r\n                        randArt = artist[randNum]\r\n                        IndexError: list index out of range\r\n\r\nThis can happen anywhere throughout the code when you&#39;re being asked a question, you can get to question 3 and get the error, or not even get to question 9 and get the error. It&#39;s completely random. I feel like its trying to occasionally get a hold of an artist and song that&#39;s been removed but that doesn&#39;t make sense since it only chooses from the amount counted on the list, not the original 10. I&#39;m not sure if my way of saying it is right or if any one would understand, because I sure don&#39;t. To clarify, my code counts how many elements there are in the list, uses that number to find a song and artist, then removes it after to stop duping, but from what I can see it seems like it&#39;s trying to find and element simply out of the range of how many elements there actually are. Thanks for bearing with my amateur code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57953965/python-3-7-3-inconsistent-code-for-song-guessing-code-stops-working-at-random-t","title":"Python 3.7.3 Inconsistent code for song guessing code, stops working at random times"},{"tags":["wix","windows-installer","burn","wix3","wix3.11"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7201584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7db48612080d887d7829f65c81e077f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vijaybabu S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7201584/vijaybabu-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569297436,"post_id":57953961,"comment_id":102540903,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57953961/only-repair-and-uninstall-can-be-seen-while-relaunching-bootstrapper-application#comment102540903_57953961"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7201584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7db48612080d887d7829f65c81e077f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vijaybabu S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7201584/vijaybabu-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569379986,"post_id":58083953,"comment_id":102573944,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57953961/only-repair-and-uninstall-can-be-seen-while-relaunching-bootstrapper-application/58083953#comment102573944_58083953"},{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11183818,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef30ac9e58e4a91401e51e83123929fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xfh2002","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11183818/xfh2002"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7201584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7db48612080d887d7829f65c81e077f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vijaybabu S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7201584/vijaybabu-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569489744,"post_id":58083953,"comment_id":102616656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57953961/only-repair-and-uninstall-can-be-seen-while-relaunching-bootstrapper-application/58083953#comment102616656_58083953"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11183818,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef30ac9e58e4a91401e51e83123929fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xfh2002","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11183818/xfh2002"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569339985,"creation_date":1569339985,"answer_id":58083953,"question_id":57953961,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58083953","body_markdown":"A modify option makes only sense if you want to remove or add features included in an msi.
