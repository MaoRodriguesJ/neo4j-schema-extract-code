If you need files to be persisted in scale operations\r\n&gt; or across restarts, you should add this app setting and set it to\r\n&gt; &quot;true&quot;. If you don&#39;t require file persistence, you can set this app\r\n&gt; setting to false.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The absence of this app setting will result in the setting being\r\n&gt; &quot;true&quot;. In other words, if this app setting does not exist in your\r\n&gt; app, you will see the /home directory mapped to Azure Storage. The app\r\n&gt; setting will be missing if you created your app while Web App for\r\n&gt; Containers was in public preview or if someone has deleted the app\r\n&gt; setting.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Keep in mind that if you enable App Service Storage, when an Azure\r\n&gt; Storage changeover occurs (which does happen periodically), your site\r\n&gt; will restart when the storage volume changes.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Note: If App Service Storage is not enabled, any files written into\r\n&gt; the /home folder will not be persisted across instances (in the case\r\n&gt; of a scale out) or across restarts.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Even if storage persistence is disabled, the /home directory will be\r\n&gt; mapped to Azure Storage in the Kudu (Advanced Tools) container. That\r\n&gt; way, the /home/LogFiles directory will persist between restarts and\r\n&gt; scale out operations in the Kudu container. Therefore, if you need to\r\n&gt; get Docker logs or other logs, always use the Kudu Bash console\r\n&gt; instead of using SSH to access your app&#39;s container.

Then I could do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% assign sorted_posts = paginator.posts | sort: &#39;updated_on&#39; | reverse %}\r\n{% for post in sorted_posts %}\r\n  ... some code here ...\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t want to go this way since I will have to manually add `updated_on` to each post where it doesn&#39;t already exists.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489689/custom-comparator-for-sorting-arrays-in-liquid-or-jekyll","title":"Custom comparator for sorting arrays in Liquid or Jekyll"},{"tags":["php","jquery","css","ajax"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1059,"user_id":1141944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4100d16b2367fb136799807312dd9f4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tshimkus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1141944/tshimkus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672511,"post_id":58489685,"comment_id":103309744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489685/i-want-to-crop-pdf-file-by-using-php-jquery-ajax#comment103309744_58489685"},{"owner":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571673292,"post_id":58489685,"comment_id":103310134,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489685/i-want-to-crop-pdf-file-by-using-php-jquery-ajax#comment103310134_58489685"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Yy078YlJqVU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3red7HuPcyMNSTQfJORJWnGS_L4gtQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Toni Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252431/toni-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":266712,"user_id":519413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7839089cd91dc5cc5eb1e0cdbf3312ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rory McCrossan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/519413/rory-mccrossan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571673768,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571673672,"creation_date":1571672371,"last_edit_date":1571673672,"question_id":58489685,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489685","body_markdown":"I am uploading a PDF file using PHP.

After some googling, I learnt that because of my anaconda installation, it was my .bash_profile that was being used on startup and not .bashrc. This is what my .bash_profile looks like (see below), just adding commands from my .bashrc file (e.g., HISTFILESIZE=100000) to the top of my .bash_profile appears to do nothing.

That&#39;s not enough to reliably interface with blocking code in highly-concurrent system.\r\n\r\n[Documentation states][1] that:\r\n\r\n&gt; Additional threads in this pool are created and are shutdown on\r\n&gt; demand. The number of threads used by this dispatcher is limited by\r\n&gt; the value of “kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism”\r\n&gt; (IO_PARALLELISM_PROPERTY_NAME) system property. It defaults to the\r\n&gt; limit of 64 threads or the number of cores (whichever is larger).\r\n\r\nI want to change `kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism` system property to something else. However, if I just do this:\r\n\r\n    adb shell &quot;setprop kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism 1000&quot;\r\n\r\nthen I get the following result:\r\n\r\n    setprop: failed to set property &#39;kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism&#39; to &#39;1000&#39;\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if I want to ship my app, then I&#39;ll need to change this property on users&#39; devices as well, right? Otherwise the app won&#39;t work. However, even assuming that it&#39;s possible, as far as I understand, all apps that change this property will override the setting for one another. This doesn&#39;t sound like a reliable mode of operation.\r\n\r\nSo, I have three questions in this context:\r\n\r\n 1. Is the property implied in documentation is indeed the &quot;system property&quot; that I tried to change?\r\n 2. How to change this property on non-rooted device for all users of my app?\r\n 3. Is there better alternative?\r\n\r\nP.S. I know that if I&#39;d only use coroutines, without blocking code, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem (probably). But let&#39;s just assume that I need to use blocking calls (e.g. legacy Java code).\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Ive tried it with append, but that havent worked for me :-(\r\n\r\n[Here is one exemple signature][1]\r\n\r\n[And here it is how it should looks afterwards with the current date][2]\r\n\r\nIve tried it with this code so far:\r\n\r\n    convert signature.png label:21.10.2019 -gravity West +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\nNow Ive tried it with other order:\r\n\r\n    convert -gravity west label:21.10.2019 signature.png +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\n[But there is only white space before the image added, no text is shown][3]\r\n\r\nIve tried it now with:\r\n\r\n    magick \\( -size 400x -background white -gravity west label:21.10.2019 \\) signature.png +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\nStill not working\r\n\r\n[as you can see here][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/41gmg.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMwE3.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9TPO.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tzDY.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489614/adding-text-before-an-image-using-imagemagick","title":"Adding text before an image using imagemagick"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2845,"user_id":8034901,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b45dfb2b0d3fc4f241e39ba8bc13ae57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kerbholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8034901/kerbholz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672491,"post_id":58489613,"comment_id":103309731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel#comment103309731_58489613"},{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10424139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eeb868d5e4cdb706af4433d310a5834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ana bel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10424139/ana-bel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2845,"user_id":8034901,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b45dfb2b0d3fc4f241e39ba8bc13ae57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kerbholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8034901/kerbholz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672585,"post_id":58489613,"comment_id":103309789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel#comment103309789_58489613"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10424139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eeb868d5e4cdb706af4433d310a5834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ana bel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10424139/ana-bel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672860,"post_id":58489728,"comment_id":103309928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel/58489728#comment103309928_58489728"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9438792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EqSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9438792/nick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9438792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EqSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9438792/nick"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571672835,"last_edit_date":1571672835,"creation_date":1571672500,"answer_id":58489728,"question_id":58489613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489728","body_markdown":" You made a mistake in the routing of the template Blade.  \r\n\r\n    {{ route(&#39;blogs_path1&#39;, [&#39;id&#39;

I expect a form with a place to input Buyer Number. As-is, the page works but displays all items and the operator has to manually find each item by buyer number and click the Mark as Paid button. What I need it to do is have an input where it asks for buyer number and only list those items with the mark button at the end. It is a closed-circuit operation so not worried about injections at this time.\r\n\r\nThe line: ``` $sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM consignsold WHERE paid=&#39;n&#39;&quot;; ```\r\nwould be changed to something like: ``` $sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM consignsold WHERE paid=&#39;n&#39; AND buyernumber = &lt;from form input&gt;&quot;;```\r\nSome have asked to clarify. . .

You can rewrite the product router definition like below :\r\n\r\n    const productRouter = [\r\n      {\r\n        path: &#39;:id&#39;,\r\n        name: &#39;ProductDetails&#39;,\r\n        component: ProductDetails\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThen, in `ProductList.vue`, you should rewrite your `router-link` as below :\r\n\r\n    &lt;router-link :to=&quot;`/products/${item.id}`&quot;&gt; {{ item.description }} &lt;/router-link&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, in `ProductPage.vue`, you are missing the `&lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;` needed to render your child routes as explained in the [vue router documentation.][1]. You could rewrite it like below :\r\n\r\n    &lt;template&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;productPage&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1&gt;This is an Product Page&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;ProductList :items=&quot;products&quot;&gt; &lt;/ProductList&gt;\r\n        &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489582/nested-router-with-lazy-load-not-work-propertly/58491269#58491269","title":"nested router with lazy load not work propertly"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5328540,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/170f13f6878598b276301fa3bc4e8bcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john chan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5328540/john-chan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571678394,"creation_date":1571671995,"question_id":58489582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489582","body_markdown":"I am new to Vue and want to navigate `Product` child routes, but it do not work &amp; get `NotFound` page instead. &lt;br&gt;\r\nSo my question is how to make it properly.\r\nOr can someone give some details.

I believe my function could be useful to the community. \r\n\r\nI am trying to sell products that I have in stock, but also allow backorders for the same and other products that my suppliers have in stock. I import the stock qty values for the 2x supplier locations into each product&#39;s custom fields using the Advanced Custom Fields and WP All Import Plugins. \r\n\r\nI then use a maximum quantity plugin to limit how many items can be added to the cart to the combined value of all 3 stock fields. The goal is to not allow adding more to the cart than is available in total.\r\n\r\n    function backorder_autostock($post_id) {\r\n    $stockqty = get_post_meta($post_id, &#39;_stock&#39;, true );\r\n\t$autostocktotal = (get_field(&#39;autostock_cpt&#39;) + get_field(&#39;autostock_jhb&#39;));\r\n\t$maxstockqty = ($stockqty + $autostocktotal);\r\n\tif ( get_field(&#39;autostock_enabled&#39;) == true &amp;&amp; $autostocktotal &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\tupdate_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_wc_max_qty_product&#39;, $maxstockqty);\r\n\t\tupdate_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_backorders&#39;, &#39;notify&#39; );\r\n\t    update_field(&#39;autostock_total&#39;, $autostocktotal, $post_id);\r\n\t}\r\n    else {\r\n        update_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_backorders&#39; , &#39;no&#39; );\r\n\t    update_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_wc_max_qty_product&#39;, &#39;&#39;);\r\n\t     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    add_action(&#39;acf/save_post&#39;, &#39;backorder_autostock&#39;);\r\n\r\nIts working pretty well, but I have 3 issues: \r\n\r\n1. $stockqty gets reduced when the order is placed, but $autostocktotal (backorder availibility qty) does not get reduced because it is not a native stock qty field.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n$stockqty = 1 and $autostocktotal = 6. \r\nCustomer orders 2x items. \r\nNow $stockqty = 0 but $autostocktotal still = 6\r\n\r\n2. The _wc_max_qty_product also does not get reduced so the maximum add to cart plugin still allows for all 7 units. (This is because of the function hook only triggering when the product is saved/updated, but not when a order is placed)\r\n\r\n3. Even if I was able to solve the above issues, I will also need the quantities for products in pending orders to be reduced from future updated $stockqty and $autostocktotal values because the system that exports the values to update these fields will not be accurate if the orders are not processed yet.\r\n\r\nIs there a practical way to get around the issues? \r\n\r\nI have been all over the web looking for an out-of-box solution to just have a dedicated field that behaves like _stock , but just for backorder stock.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489581/woocommerce-backorder-stock-manage","title":"Woocommerce Backorder Stock Manage"},{"tags":["java","spring","git","spring-boot","testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672149,"post_id":58489580,"comment_id":103309551,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push#comment103309551_58489580"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6304206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bxeU_Wvk3RQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABAE/WUQH4BtsS-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EnzoMolion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6304206/enzomolion"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571673046,"post_id":58489580,"comment_id":103310011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push#comment103310011_58489580"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6304206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bxeU_Wvk3RQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABAE/WUQH4BtsS-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EnzoMolion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6304206/enzomolion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571737893,"post_id":58490316,"comment_id":103331826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push/58490316#comment103331826_58490316"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":286,"user_id":8045100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81f4636246f02f7b275cb3c958c5b768?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Hopkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8045100/frank-hopkins"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571674678,"creation_date":1571674678,"answer_id":58490316,"question_id":58489580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58490316","body_markdown":"You can use any (bash) script as a git pre-commit or pre-push hook.

am working in a java jpa Hibernate-search application, I know Hibernate-search index automatically every @Id annotation in an entity. The problem is that I have a &quot;master domain&quot; class with contains the @Id annotation, and then I have another class with inherit &quot;master domain&quot;, then seems to be the Hibernate search is not recognizing the @Id field inherited.\r\n\r\nthis is my master domain class.\r\n```\r\n@MappedSuperclass\r\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\r\npublic abstract class MasterDomain&lt;Key extends Object&gt; implements Serializable\r\n{\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private Key id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a class &quot;Language&quot; which inherits this class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Indexed\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Language extends MasterDomain&lt;Long&gt;{\r\n\r\n    @Field\r\n    private String name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally I have another class called &quot;LanguageRelation&quot; which is related with Language class.

I think I would make my routes look something like:\r\n\r\n    Rails.application.routes.draw do\r\n      resources :hotels do \r\n        resources :room_types, shallow: true do \r\n          scope

/room_types/:room_type_id/options(.:format)   room_types/options#index\r\n       hotel_room_types GET    /hotels/:hotel_id/room_types(.:format)        room_types#index\r\n                        POST   /hotels/:hotel_id/room_types(.:format)        room_types#create\r\n    new_hotel_room_type GET    /hotels/:hotel_id/room_types/new(.:format)    room_types#new\r\n         edit_room_type GET

/room_types/:id(.:format)                     room_types#update\r\n                        PUT    /room_types/:id(.:format)                     room_types#update\r\n                        DELETE

/hotels/:id(.:format)                         hotels#destroy\r\n\r\n\r\nIf needed and/or desired, you can limit the generated routes using `only:` or `except:`. For instance, you could do: \r\n\r\n    Rails.application.routes.draw do\r\n      resources :hotels, only: [] do \r\n        resources :room_types, only: [], shallow: true do \r\n          scope module: :room_types do \r\n            resources :options, only: [:index]\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAnd get just: \r\n\r\n    room_type_options GET    /room_types/:room_type_id/options(.:format)   room_types/options#index\r\n\r\nYou could also get the same thing by doing: \r\n\r\n    Rails.application.routes.draw do\r\n      get &#39;room_types/:room_type_id/options&#39;, to: &#39;room_types/options#index&#39;\r\n    end\r\n\r\nWhichever floats your boat...\r\n\r\nThen, I would change my js to something more like: \r\n\r\n    &lt;%= simple_form_for [@hotel, @reservation] do |f|%&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;%= f.simple_fields_for :rooms do |room| %&gt;\r\n    &lt;%= room.input :room_type, collection: @room_type_list, input_html:{\r\n            id: &quot;room_type&quot;\r\n          }%&gt;\r\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;h4&gt;Options&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;room-type-options&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- List all options for room_type by name and display field for option_quantity  --&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;% end %&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script &gt;\r\n      // dynamic options for change category\r\n      $(document).on(&quot;change&quot;, &quot;#room_type&quot;, function(){\r\n        var room_type = $(this).val();\r\n        var room_type_id = # do something here...\r\n\r\n        $.ajax({\r\n          url: &quot;/room_types/#{room_type_id}/options&quot;,\r\n          method: &quot;GET&quot;,\r\n          dataType: &quot;json&quot;,\r\n          error: function (xhr, status, error) {\r\n            console.error(&#39;AJAX Error: &#39; + status + error);\r\n          },\r\n          success: function (response) {\r\n            console.log(response);\r\n            $(&quot;#room-type-options&quot;).html(response)\r\n          }\r\n        });\r\n      });\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nA few things to note here: \r\n\r\n - You&#39;ll need a  `RoomTypes::OptionsController` with an `index` action\r\n - The `index` action should return an html blob of room type options\r\n - You don&#39;t need to pass the `hotel_id` because a `RoomType belongs_to :hotel` and the `hotel_id`, therefore, can be derived (if needed) from the `RoomType` (thus the `shallow: true` bit). You can read more about this in the [Rails Routing from the Outside In](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html) guide\r\n - You&#39;ll need to fill in the `var room_type_id = ` bit on your own. You should be able to get that from the `room.input` but may need to tweak your code a bit - I&#39;m not sure\r\n - The `$(&quot;#room-type-options&quot;).html(response)` bit is directionally correct, but may need to be fiddled with because I forget exactly what the response structure is\r\n - That `&lt;div id=&quot;room-type-options&quot;&gt;` bit may or may not be correct. I haven&#39;t hand-crafted html in I don&#39;t know how long. (I use haml.)\r\n\r\nYou can implement the `RoomTypes::OptionsController` by creating an `options_controller.rb` file in a `app/controllers/room_types` folder. It would look like any other controller: \r\n\r\n    # app/controllers/room_types/options_controller.rb\r\n    class RoomTypes::OptionsController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n\r\n      def index\r\n        @room_type = RoomType.find_by(params[:room_type_id])\r\n        ... do some stuff ...\r\n        ... render some html ...\r\n        ... do a happy dance ...\r\n      end\r\n\r\n    end\r\n\r\nBecause this controller is namespaced, you can have it at the same time as you have your regular `OptionsController` and `RoomTypesController` and there won&#39;t be any conflict.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489506/is-it-possible-to-generate-a-simple-form-field-out-of-a-json-response/58490971#58490971","title":"Is it possible to generate a simple_form field out of a JSON response?"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":11993344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2450bb2dd119ad08846627702e7f96b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"techquestion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11993344/techquestion"},"last_editor":{"reputation":67,"user_id":11993344,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2450bb2dd119ad08846627702e7f96b1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"techquestion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11993344/techquestion"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571754783,"creation_date":1571671706,"last_edit_date":1571734539,"question_id":58489506,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489506","body_markdown":"I&#39;m searching for a way to create simple_form fields of all options belonging to a room_type, such that a user can fill in the option_quantity.
