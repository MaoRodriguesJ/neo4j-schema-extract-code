The dataset I&#39;m using contains survey responses, with a column for each question (Q1, Q2, etc) and the responses on each row. The function has to be able to select the column (Q1, Q2, etc) and then filter from within that column for one particular response so that it can count it. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to write a function that allows you to include the question number that you want to select as one of the arguments. Here is the code: \r\n\r\n```\r\nmy_function &lt;- function(survey, question_number) {\r\n  selected_question &lt;- survey %&gt;%\r\n    select(question_number)\r\n  everyday_responses &lt;- selected_question %&gt;%\r\n    filter(question_number == &quot;Every day&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n    count()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for selecting the column but does not work for filtering within that column. I&#39;ve worked out that this is because I have to input the question_number argument as &quot;Q1&quot; (with quotation marks around it). This is causing the filter(question_number == &quot;Every day&quot;) line to not work properly, as this is expecting the column name without the &quot; &quot; (Q1 not &quot;Q1&quot;). \r\n\r\nCan anybody explain why this is happening and potentially suggest a fix? I&#39;m fairly new to using R, so I may be missing something completely. \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance :D

discussion will be easier with an appropriate example. Validating URLs isn&#39;t so expensive. What if you need to hit eg 100 URLs and pick the first 3 responses? \r\n\r\nIn that case both the worker and the buffer make sense. \r\n\r\n**Edit 2**\r\n\r\nOne of the comments adds extra complexity - the tasks are executed concurrently and the results need to be emitted as they arrive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor starters, `ValidateUrl` could be rewritten as an iterator method:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n    this IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls)\r\n{\r\n    await foreach (var url in urls)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($&quot;Url {url} received&quot;);\r\n        var isValid=await MockValidateUrl(url);\r\n        yield return (url, isValid);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThere&#39;s no need for a worker Task as all methods are asynchronous. The iterator method won&#39;t proceed unless a consumer *asks* for a result. Even if `MockValidateUrl` does something expensive, it could use a `Task.Run` itself or get wrapped in a `Task.Run`. That would generate quite a few tasks though.\r\n\r\nFor completeness&#39; sake you can add a `CancellationToken` and `ConfigureAwait(false)` :\r\n\r\n\r\n    public static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n           IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls, \r\n           [EnumeratorCancellation]CancellationToken token=default)\r\n    {\r\n        await foreach(var url in urls.WithCancellation(token).ConfigureAwait(false))\r\n        {\r\n            var isValid=await MockValidateUrl(url).ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n            yield return (url,isValid);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn any case, as soon as the caller stops iterating, `ValidateUrls` will stop.\r\n\r\n**Buffering**\r\n\r\nBuffering is a problem - no matter how it&#39;s programmed, the worker won&#39;t stop until the buffer fills. The buffer&#39;s size is how many iterations the worker will go on before it realizes it needs to stop. This is a great case for a Channel (yes, again!) :\r\n\r\n\r\n    public static IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n            IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls,CancellationToken token=default)\r\n    {\r\n        var channel=Channel.CreateBounded&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt;(2);\r\n        var writer=channel.Writer;\r\n        _ = Task.Run(async ()=&gt;{\r\n                    await foreach(var url in urls.WithCancellation(token))\r\n                    {\r\n                        var isValid=await MockValidateUrl(url);\r\n                        await writer.WriteAsync((url,isValid));\r\n                    }\r\n            },token)\r\n            .ContinueWith(t=&gt;writer.Complete(t.Exception));        \r\n        return channel.Reader.ReadAllAsync(token);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s better to pass around ChannelReaders instead of IAsyncEnumerables though. At the very least, no async enumerator is constructed until someone tries to read from the ChannelReader. It&#39;s also easier to construct pipelines as extension methods :\r\n\r\n    public static ChannelReader&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n            this ChannelReader&lt;string&gt; urls,int capacity,CancellationToken token=default)\r\n    {\r\n        var channel=Channel.CreateBounded&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt;(capacity);\r\n        var writer=channel.Writer;\r\n        _ = Task.Run(async ()=&gt;{\r\n                    await foreach(var url in urls.ReadAllAsync(token))\r\n                    {\r\n                        var isValid=await MockValidateUrl(url);\r\n                        await writer.WriteAsync((url,isValid));\r\n                    }\r\n            },token)\r\n            .ContinueWith(t=&gt;writer.Complete(t.Exception));        \r\n        return channel.Reader;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis syntax allows constructing pipelines in a fluent manner. Let&#39;s say we have this helper method to convert IEnumerables to channesl (or IAsyncEnumerables) :\r\n\r\n    public static ChannelReader&lt;T&gt; AsChannel(\r\n             IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; items)\r\n    {\r\n        var channel=Channel.CreateUnbounded();        \r\n        var writer=channel.Writer;\r\n        foreach(var item in items)\r\n        {\r\n            channel.TryWrite(item);\r\n        }\r\n        return channel.Reader;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe can write :\r\n\r\n    var pipeline=urlList.AsChannel()     //takes a list and writes it to a channel\r\n                        .ValidateUrls();\r\n\r\n    await foreach(var (url,isValid) in pipeline.ReadAllAsync())\r\n    {\r\n       //Use the items here\r\n    }\r\n                  \r\n**Concurrent calls with immediate propagation**\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s easy with channels, although the worker in this time needs to fire all of the tasks at once. Essentially, we need multiple workers. That&#39;s not something that can be done with just IAsyncEnumerable.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, if we wanted to use eg 5 concurrent tasks to process the inputs we could write \r\n\r\n        var tasks = Enumerable.Range(0,5).\r\n                      .Select(_ =&gt; Task.Run(async ()=&gt;{\r\n                                     /// \r\n                                 },token));\r\n        _ = Task.WhenAll(tasks)(t=&gt;writer.Complete(t.Exception));        \r\n\r\ninstead of :\r\n\r\n        _ = Task.Run(async ()=&gt;{\r\n            /// \r\n            },token)\r\n            .ContinueWith(t=&gt;writer.Complete(t.Exception));        \r\n\r\nUsing a large number of workers could be enough. I&#39;m not sure if IAsyncEnumerable can be consumed by multiple workers, and I don&#39;t really want to find out.\r\n\r\n**Premature Cancellation**\r\n\r\nAll of the above work if the client consumes all results. To stop processing after eg the first 5 results though, we need the CancellationToken :\r\n\r\n    var cts=new CancellationTokenSource();\r\n\r\n    var pipeline=urlList.AsChannel()     //takes a list and writes it to a channel\r\n                        .ValidateUrls(cts.Token);\r\n\r\n    int i=0;\r\n    await foreach(var (url,isValid) in pipeline.ReadAllAsync())\r\n    {\r\n        //Break after 3 iterations\r\n        if(i++&gt;2)\r\n        {\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cts.Cancel();\r\n\r\nThis code itself could be extracted in a method that receives a ChannelReader and, in this case, the CancellationTokenSource :\r\n\r\n```\r\nstatic async LastStep(this ChannelReader&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; input,CancellationTokenSource cts)\r\n    {\r\n    int i=0;\r\n    await foreach(var (url,isValid) in pipeline.ReadAllAsync())\r\n    {\r\n        //Break after 3 iterations\r\n        if(i++&gt;2)\r\n        {\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        ....\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cts.Cancel();        \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the pipeline becomes :\r\n\r\n    var cts=new CancellationTokenSource();\r\n\r\n    var pipeline=urlList.AsChannel()     \r\n                        .ValidateUrls(cts.Token)\r\n                        .LastStep(cts);\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216380/how-to-stop-propagating-an-asynchronous-stream-iasyncenumerable/58221124#58221124","title":"How to stop propagating an asynchronous stream (IAsyncEnumerable)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570316107,"last_edit_date":1570316107,"creation_date":1570197942,"answer_id":58237995,"question_id":58216380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58237995","body_markdown":"I suppose I should answer my own question, since I now have a simple enough generic solution.\r\n\r\n**Update:** I am scraping my previous answer because I discovered a much easier solution. It is embarassingly simple actually. All I have to do is to enclose the yielding part of the `ValidateUrls` iterator into a `try-finally` block. The `finally` block will be executed on every case, either by the caller completing normally the enumeration, or abnormally by a `break` or an exception. So this is how I can get the notification I am looking for, by cancelling a `CancellationTokenSource` on `finally`:\r\n\r\n    private static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n        this IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls)\r\n    {\r\n        var buffer = new System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock&lt;string&gt;();\r\n        var completionCTS = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\n        _ = Task.Run(async () =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            await foreach (var url in urls)\r\n            {\r\n                if (completionCTS.IsCancellationRequested) break;\r\n                Console.WriteLine($&quot;Url {url} received&quot;);\r\n                await buffer.SendAsync(url);\r\n            }\r\n            buffer.Complete();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            while (await buffer.OutputAvailableAsync() &amp;&amp; buffer.TryReceive(out var url))\r\n            {\r\n                yield return (url, await MockValidateUrl(url));\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        finally // This runs when the caller completes the enumeration\r\n        {\r\n            completionCTS.Cancel();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI should probably note that an async iterator that doesn&#39;t support cancellation is not a good practice. Without it the caller has no easy way to stop the awaiting between the consumption of one value and the next. So a better signature for my method should be:\r\n\r\n    private static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n        this IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls,\r\n        [EnumeratorCancellation]CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)\r\n    {\r\n\r\nThe token could then be passed to the awaited methods of the yielding loop, the [`OutputAvailableAsync`][1] and the `MockValidateUrl`.\r\n\r\nFrom the caller&#39;s perspective, the token can be passed either directly, or by chaining the extension method [`WithCancellation`][2].\r\n\r\n    await foreach (var result in ValidateUrls(GetMockUrls()).WithCancellation(token))\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.dataflow.dataflowblock.outputavailableasync\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.taskasyncenumerableextensions.withcancellation","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216380/how-to-stop-propagating-an-asynchronous-stream-iasyncenumerable/58237995#58237995","title":"How to stop propagating an asynchronous stream (IAsyncEnumerable)"}],"owner":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"comment_count":19,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":113,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570316107,"creation_date":1570095641,"last_edit_date":1570128045,"question_id":58216380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58216380","body_markdown":"I have a method that accepts an [`IAsyncEnumerable`][1] as argument, and returns also an `IAsyncEnumerable`. It calls a web method for each item in the input stream, and propagates the result to the output stream. My question is how can I be notified if the caller of my method has stopped enumerating the output stream, so I can stop enumerating the input stream inside my method? It seems that I should be able to be notified because the caller disposes by default the [`IAsyncEnumerator`][2] that gets from my method. Is there any build-in mechanism that generates such a notification for compiler-generated async methods? If not, what is the easiest to implement alternative?\r\n\r\nExample. The web method validates if an url is valid or not. There is a never ending stream of urls provided, but the caller stops enumerating the results when more than 2 invalid urls are found:\r\n\r\n    var invalidCount = 0;\r\n    await foreach (var result in ValidateUrls(GetMockUrls()))\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($&quot;Url {result.Url} is &quot;\r\n            + (result.IsValid ? &quot;OK&quot; : &quot;Invalid!&quot;));\r\n        if (!result.IsValid) invalidCount++;\r\n        if (invalidCount &gt; 2) break;\r\n    }\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;--Async enumeration finished--&quot;);\r\n    await Task.Delay(2000);\r\n\r\nThe generator of the urls. One url is generated every 300 msec.\r\n\r\n    private static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; GetMockUrls()\r\n    {\r\n        int index = 0;\r\n        while (true)\r\n        {\r\n            await Task.Delay(300);\r\n            yield return $&quot;https://mock.com/{++index:0000}&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe validator of the urls. There is a requirement that the input stream is enumerated eagerly, so two asynchronous workflows are running in parallel. The first workflow inserts the urls in a queue, and the second workflow picks the urls one by one and validates them. A [`BufferBlock`][3] is used as async queue.\r\n\r\n    private static async IAsyncEnumerable&lt;(string Url, bool IsValid)&gt; ValidateUrls(\r\n        this IAsyncEnumerable&lt;string&gt; urls)\r\n    {\r\n        var buffer = new System.Threading.Tasks.Dataflow.BufferBlock&lt;string&gt;();\r\n        _ = Task.Run(async () =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            await foreach (var url in urls)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine($&quot;Url {url} received&quot;);\r\n                await buffer.SendAsync(url);\r\n            }\r\n            buffer.Complete();\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        while (await buffer.OutputAvailableAsync() &amp;&amp; buffer.TryReceive(out var url))\r\n        {\r\n            yield return (url, await MockValidateUrl(url));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Clarification:** the queue is mandatory, and removing it is not an option. It is an essential component of this problem.\r\n\r\nThe validator of a single url. The validation process lasts 300 msec on average.\r\n\r\n    private static Random _random = new Random();\r\n    private static async Task&lt;bool&gt; MockValidateUrl(string url)\r\n    {\r\n        await Task.Delay(_random.Next(100, 600));\r\n        return _random.Next(0, 2) != 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0001 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0001 is Invalid!\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0002 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0003 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0002 is OK\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0004 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0003 is Invalid!\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0005 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0004 is OK\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0005 is OK\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0006 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0006 is Invalid!\r\n--Async enumeration finished--\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0007 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0008 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0009 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0010 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0011 received\r\nUrl https://mock.com/0012 received\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that urls are still generated and received after the caller/client has finished the asynchronous enumeration. I would like to fix this, so that no more messages appear in the console after `--Async enumeration finished--`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerable-1\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.iasyncenumerator-1\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.dataflow.bufferblock-1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216380/how-to-stop-propagating-an-asynchronous-stream-iasyncenumerable","title":"How to stop propagating an asynchronous stream (IAsyncEnumerable)"},{"tags":["azure-storage-blobs","azure-data-factory","unzip","blobstorage","data-ingestion"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13671,"user_id":8198946,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oRGKD.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jay Gong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8198946/jay-gong"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570440983,"creation_date":1570440983,"answer_id":58266932,"question_id":58216379,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58266932","body_markdown":"Based on the [official document][1], adf blob storage dataset only supports below compression type:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nTar format is not supported by adf naturally.

The project is inactive, and in its current state it will not work with Visual Studio 2019 properly.\r\n\r\nConsider migrating to [VisualSVN][1] that fully supports Visual Studio 2019. It is **completely free for use on non-domain computers (no registration required)** and provides about the same functionality compared with AnkhSVN. Note that some users find VisualSVN to be much better for their cases.\r\n\r\nIt is should be very easy to migrate from AnkhSVN to VisualSVN. The most recent [VisualSVN 7.1][2] and [VisualSVN 6.5][3] releases add support for multiple working copies within a single solution, and this makes the migration practically instant and painless for almost all users. See the article [KB58: Migrating from AnkhSVN to VisualSVN][4] for instructions and the article [KB7: Using Multiple Working Copies in VisualSVN][5] if your solution projects span across multiple working copies.\r\n\r\n&gt; I uninstalled the extension, downloaded it again, applied the changes\r\n&gt; as described in Installation of AnkhSVN Visual Studio 2019. I then\r\n&gt; installed it again in VS 2019. This unfortunately does not solve the\r\n&gt; problem.\r\n\r\nHacking the VS2017 VSIX files by adding a few string to make this VSIX install into VS2019 is a very bad idea. This action does not magically make AnkhSVN support VS2019 - it allows its installation into VS2019.

You **cannot** model Java classes with OWL. With that said, it is often the case that Java classes correspond to an in-memory representation of something you want to represent knowledge about. Thus, there could be correspondences between an OOP model and an OWL ontology. However, there is no single way of mapping an OOP model to an OWL ontology, and there are pitfalls that should be avoided.\r\n\r\nOne very common mistake people do when thinking of OWL as an object oriented formalism is to think that classes have attributes, and that attributes or properties belong to a class. In OWL, they don&#39;t. While it is sometimes possible to make sense of a sentence like &quot;the property `name` of the class `Organism`&quot;, this is as much meaningful in OWL as &quot;the class `Organism` of the property `name`&quot;. Classes and properties exist on their own, independently from each other. None belong to the other. However, they can be related in different ways.\r\n\r\nAnother typical mistake is to misinterpret the relations `domain` and `range` that connect a property to a class. Entities that have a property are typed with *every* domains the property has.\r\n\r\nNow, let us go back to your problem. It is very hard to answer your modelling problem without more details about what you are trying to model. As I said, having a Java class is not sufficient to say how the corresponding OWL terms should be defined. For instance, what do you mean with the term &quot;feature&quot;? The attribute `features` of the Java class `Organism` is a list. Is the order important? An `animal_property` is a number?! What is this number representing? Is `name` supposed to be understood in the common sense English word &quot;name&quot;? In my opinion, anything that one can think of can be named, not just organisms or features.\r\n\r\nIn your case, an intuitive understanding of what you may want have to be guessed based on the choice of English words you&#39;ve made, and a rough idea of what programming constructs are usually used for. My intuitition is that it is a good idea to map each Java class to an OWL class, and to map inheritance to the `subClassOf` relation.\r\n\r\nFor properties, it is more complicated. Most Java attributes that have a primitive type map naturally to an OWL datatype property. But not always! OOP classes often contain auxiliary data structures that only make sense for the application logic, yet are irrelevent to the representation of our knowledge of the type of entities. In your model, it is very much possible that the attribute `feature1` in Java class `Features` should not be mapped to an OWL property at all. The `name` attribute in `Organism` could map to the same property as the `name` attribute in `Features`, but possibly not, depending on what you mean. My intuition is that there should be a single `name` property that shoud **not** have any defined domain (such that it could be used safely on any entity).\r\n\r\nOOP languages have primitive data types that are very similar to the XML schema datatypes (XSDs). However, the &quot;obvious&quot; mapping is not always the best. With my understanding of the `name` property, I would expect that language tags could be used. If the range is `xsd:string`, then language tagged literals are forbidden.\r\n\r\nBased on the name of the property `features` and class `Feature`, I would tend to agree that the range of `features` should be `Feature`, although I do not really understand what `Feature` is supposed to represent. Whether or not the domain should be `Organism` totally depends on what exactly the class `Feature` precisely represents.\r\n\r\nFinally, the properties `animal_property` and `plant_property` are mysterious and I have the intuition that they do not represent much of the intrinsic nature of animals and plants. In any case, is there a reason to restrict the size of these integer to fit in an `xsd:int? In general, it is good practice to use `xsd:integer` for numbers that have no particular reason to be bounded. There is no reason to have our representation of knowledge about the world be constrained by the weak 32 bits architectures of our old computers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216347/how-can-we-specify-values-in-a-class-instance-in-owl-xml/58377916#58377916","title":"How can we specify values in a class instance in OWL XML?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8729178,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28a7602414c4a317b51f908edf9c1c78?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Feather Ridgemont","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8729178/feather-ridgemont"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571059843,"creation_date":1570095534,"question_id":58216347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58216347","body_markdown":"I have just started using OWL XML and was trying to give values to instances of a class but I cannot understand how can that be done.

In lieu of this, we can use an inline subquery:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n        t1.id,\r\n        COALESCE(t2.name, &#39;NO&#39;) AS name\r\n    FROM\r\n    (\r\n        SELECT 1 AS id UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT 2 UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT 3 UNION ALL\r\n        -- other numbers\r\n        SELECT 88 UNION ALL\r\n        -- more numbers\r\n        SELECT 99\r\n    ) t1\r\n    LEFT JOIN mytable t2\r\n        ON t1.id = t2.id\r\n    WHERE\r\n        t1.id IN (1, 3, 88, 99)\r\n    ORDER BY\r\n        t1.id;\r\n\r\nThe strategy here is twofold.  First, we left join the calendar table to your table, retaining all `id` values in the full range.  Then, we restrict to only `id` values you want to see.  For those `id` values which do _not_ appear in your table, the names would show up as `NULL`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216342/how-to-select-in-range-and-print-if-no-result-on-one-of-the-items/58216416#58216416","title":"How to select in range and print if no result on one of the items"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":2920745,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2a0037265329ebf92aed0794e3c8aa23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"leoleovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2920745/leoleovich"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570095776,"creation_date":1570095521,"question_id":58216342,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58216342","body_markdown":"I have a table which let&#39;s say for simplicity consists only of ids and names:\r\n```\r\nselect * from mytable;\r\n+----+-------+\r\n| id | name  |\r\n+----+-------+\r\n|  1 | Test1 |\r\n|  2 | Test3 |\r\n|  3 | Test3 |\r\n+----+-------+\r\n3 rows in set (0.20 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to select ids in subset of the ids:\r\n```\r\nselect * from mytable where id in (1 ,3, 88);\r\n+----+-------+\r\n| id | name  |\r\n+----+-------+\r\n|  1 | Test1 |\r\n|  3 | Test3 |\r\n+----+-------+\r\n2 rows in set (0.20 sec)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you see there is no 88 in the result.

One of those places is in the Window init where the &quot;resizable&quot; parameter is discussed.\r\n\r\nIt says about this parameter:\r\nresizable\t(bool) If True, allows the user to resize the window. Note the not all Elements will change size or location when resizing.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking Elements do not automatically size themselves to fit the window, especially when you place a size on an element.  The Qt port of PySimpleGUI does a better job of resizing elements to fit window sizes.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if this answers the question as I&#39;m not actually sure as to what the question is.  Do you expect the Text itself to resize, as in the font size?  Or just the length of the line the text is on?\r\n\r\nTIP - I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware that the sample code supplied won&#39;t run as it doesn&#39;t have the case correct on several items (like the import and Text element).  It would be helpful for future PySimpleGUI questions if the entire piece of code that defines the layout AND the window AND the event loop were included.  Then people could run the code and see what you are seeing that is not what you expect.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

For that I am doing it in the following way:\r\n\r\n\r\nPython script:\r\n\r\n\r\n    image = image_in_bytes\r\n    \r\n    print (image)\r\n\r\n\r\nGo script:\r\n\r\n\r\n    cmd := exec.Command(&quot;python&quot;, &quot;image.py&quot;)\r\n    stdout, err := cmd.StdoutPipe()\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        panic(err)\r\n    }\r\n    err = cmd.Start()\r\n    if err != nil {\r\n        panic(err)\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(stdout) //I need the image in []byte\r\n    cmd.Wait()\r\n\r\n\r\nBut with the above code golang is waiting forever without any output...\r\n\r\nAny idea?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216326/call-python-script-and-catch-binary-output","title":"Call python script and catch binary output"},{"tags":["qt","background","qml","border"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1264,"user_id":1228771,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SF8S5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Amfasis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1228771/amfasis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570095983,"creation_date":1570095983,"answer_id":58216484,"question_id":58216325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58216484","body_markdown":"The `color` property in QML can be fed with `QColor` or a string (or bound to another property of course) see [Qt Docs](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qml-color.html).\r\n\r\nIn this case you are feeding it with a property called `transparent`, however QML cannot find it:\r\n\r\n    qrc:/main.qml:23: ReferenceError: transparent is not defined\r\n\r\nWhen you try the following you will have a transparent background:\r\n\r\n    color: &quot;transparent&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216325/qml-toolbutton-background-colour/58216484#58216484","title":"QML ToolButton background colour"}],"owner":{"reputation":2408,"user_id":3697264,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5adc5afbd7a1145fdd762d872b4b43bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SPlatten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3697264/splatten"},"last_editor":{"reputation":112790,"user_id":6622587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAYS0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"eyllanesc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622587/eyllanesc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58216484,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570109525,"creation_date":1570095479,"last_edit_date":1570109525,"question_id":58216325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58216325","body_markdown":"I have the following QML:\r\n\r\n        ToolButton {\r\n            id: frameCapButton\r\n            height: mainWindow.iconHeight\r\n            width: height\r\n\r\n            background: Rectangle {\r\n                radius: 2\r\n                border.width: (imageCaptureModel.imageType == ImageCaptureModel.ImageTypeFrame) ? 2 : 0\r\n                border.color: (imageCaptureModel.imageType == ImageCaptureModel.ImageTypeFrame) ? &quot;#ff0000&quot; : &quot;transparent&quot;\r\n            }\r\n            contentItem: ColoredImage {\r\n                source: &quot;ImageViewer/framecapture.svg&quot;                            \r\n                color: Colours.buhlerGreen()\r\n            }\r\n            onClicked: {\r\n                imageCaptureModel.imageType = ImageCaptureModel.ImageTypeFrame\r\n                placeHolder = frameText\r\n                pixelField.text = &quot;&quot;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI added the block &quot;background&quot; and it gives the entire button a white background, why?

THe customer can have multiple locations and i want to show the locations depending on the current user his customer_id. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish this i wrote this code:\r\n**This is the code were the error is thrown.**\r\n\r\n\tif (isset(auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;customer_id) &amp;&amp; !auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;hasRole(&#39;admin&#39;)) {\r\n        $customer = Customer::find(auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;customer_id);\r\n        $locations = $customer-&gt;locations()-&gt;get();\r\n    } else {\r\n        $locations = Location::all();\r\n    }\r\n    return view(&#39;locations.index&#39;, [&#39;locations&#39; =&gt; $locations]);\r\n\r\nI check if the user has a customer_id and isnt a admin. \r\nIf both are true i get the customer connected to the customer_id. \r\nThen i retrieve all locations related to that customer. \r\nThis all works and when i check it with dd($var) it always returns the expected values. \r\n\r\n**index.blade.php**\r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;locations&quot; class=&quot;table align-items-center table-flush&quot; style=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;thead class=&quot;thead-light&quot;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;Customer&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;Location Name&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;Address&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;Postal Code&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;City&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;{{ __(&#39;Country&#39;) }}&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n                                &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n                                &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n                                @foreach ($locations as $location)\r\n                                    &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;customer-&gt;name}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;name}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;address}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;postalcode}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;city}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;td&gt;{{ $location-&gt;country}}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n                                @endforeach\r\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nNow when i return the view i get the following error:\r\n`Method Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Collection::links does not exist`\r\n\r\nThe strange thing here is that i already return data with other entities in the same way and that works fine. **This code does the same thing and actually works.**\r\n\r\n    if (isset(auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;distributor_id) &amp;&amp; !auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;hasRole(&#39;admin&#39;)) {\r\n        $distributor = Distributor::find(auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;distributor_id);\r\n        $customer = $distributor-&gt;customers()-&gt;get();\r\n    } else {\r\n        $customer = Customer::all();\r\n    }\r\n    return view(&#39;customers.index&#39;, [&#39;customers&#39; =&gt; $customer]);\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter looking around on the internet and SO i found this question: \r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24605170/laravel-4-call-to-undefined-method-illuminate-database-eloquent-collectionlink. \r\nThe question looks a lot like mine but the awnser doesnt solve my problem.

In this module, you can create a closure over `smtpTransport` and only export the `sendEmail` function.\r\n\r\n**email-client**\r\n```javascript\r\nconst nodemailer = require(&quot;nodemailer&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({\r\n    service: &quot;Gmail&quot;,\r\n    port: 465,\r\n    auth: {\r\n        user: &quot;YOUR_GMAIL_SERVER&quot;,\r\n        pass: &quot;YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD&quot;\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nasync function sendMail({ to, subject, html }) {\r\n    return smtpTransport.sendMail({ to, subject, html });\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    sendMail\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: `smtpTransport.sendMail` returns a Promise, that we will deal with inside your controller. \r\n\r\n**controller**\r\n\r\nFirst, you could import the `sendEmail` function that&#39;s exported from `email-client.js`, then you can use this in your controller. Note ive changed the controller to be [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) &amp; prefer mongoose [Model.create](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19701154/mongoose-whats-the-differences-between-model-create-and-collection-insert) (makes testing a little easier).\r\n\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst { sendEmail } = require(&quot;./email-client.js&quot;);\r\n\r\nexports.createListing = async (req, res) =&gt;

Then you also have the single point for `catch()` when either of methods fail.\r\n\r\nThat said, it has been brought to attention the current API actually would return a `Promise` when invoked without a callback, but then you would probably want `async` and `await` syntax in order to make access to things cleaner:\r\n\r\n\r\n    exports.createListing = async (req, res) =&gt; { // &lt;-- mark block as async\r\n        // Validate request\r\n        if(!req.body.content) {\r\n            return res.status(400).send({\r\n                message: &quot;Fields can not be empty&quot;\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Set options after the request was verified.\r\n\r\n        const smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({\r\n            service: &#39;Gmail&#39;,\r\n            port: 465,\r\n            auth: {\r\n              user: &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_SERVER&#39;,\r\n              pass: &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD&#39;\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        const listing = new Listing({\r\n            title: req.body.title, \r\n            city: req.body.city,\r\n            street: req.body.street,\r\n            businessname: req.body.businessname,\r\n            description: req.body.description\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        try {                                    // try..catch for error handling\r\n\r\n          let data = await listing.save();       // await the save\r\n\r\n          var mailOptions = {\r\n            to: data.email,\r\n            subject: &#39;ENTER_YOUR_SUBJECT&#39;,\r\n            html: `&lt;p&gt;${data.title}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                  &lt;p&gt;${data.city}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                  &lt;p&gt;${data.street}&lt;/p&gt;`,\r\n                  ...\r\n          };\r\n\r\n          await smtpTransport.sendMail(mailOptions);   // await the sendMail\r\n\r\n          smtpTransport.close(); // this awaited the actual send\r\n          res.send(data); \r\n        } catch(err) {\r\n          res.status(500).send({\r\n             essage: err.message || &quot;Some error occurred while creating the listing.&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that this approach is *serial* in execution.

This may or may not be your intended case, but simply creating the wrapping Promise should at least the right direction to follow.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216290/how-to-include-this-nodemailer-function-inside-this-controller-function/58216679#58216679","title":"How to include this nodemailer function inside this controller function?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":575,"user_id":3351067,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uPwp9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ArUn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3351067/arun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570099990,"creation_date":1570099990,"answer_id":58217621,"question_id":58216290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58217621","body_markdown":"Export your sendMail method and import it in your controller.\r\n\r\n**controller function**\r\n\r\n    let sendMail = require(&#39;your nodemailer file&#39;).sendMail;\r\n    exports.createListing = (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n        // Validate request\r\n        if(!req.body.content) {\r\n            return res.status(400).send({\r\n                message: &quot;Fields can not be empty&quot;\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        const listing = new Listing({\r\n            title: req.body.title, \r\n            city: req.body.city,\r\n            street: req.body.street,\r\n            businessname: req.body.businessname,\r\n            description: req.body.description\r\n        });\r\n    \r\n        listing.save()\r\n        .then(data =&gt; {\r\n            sendMail({\r\n            title: req.body.title, \r\n            city: req.body.city,\r\n            street: req.body.street})\r\n            res.send(data);\r\n        }).catch(err =&gt; {\r\n            res.status(500).send({\r\n                message: err.message || &quot;Some error occurred while creating the listing.&quot;\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n**NodeMailer function**\r\n\r\n    var smtpTransport = nodemailer.createTransport({\r\n            service: &#39;Gmail&#39;,\r\n            port: 465,\r\n            auth: {\r\n              user: &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_SERVER&#39;,\r\n              pass: &#39;YOUR_GMAIL_PASSWORD&#39;\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    module.exports.sendmail = (data)=&gt;{\r\n    return new Promise((resolve,reject)=&gt;{\r\n    \r\n          var mailOptions = {\r\n            to: data.email,\r\n            subject: &#39;ENTER_YOUR_SUBJECT&#39;,\r\n            html: `&lt;p&gt;${data.title}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                  &lt;p&gt;${data.city}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                  &lt;p&gt;${data.street}&lt;/p&gt;`,\r\n                  ...\r\n          };\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n          smtpTransport.sendMail(mailOptions,\r\n            (error, response) =&gt; {\r\n              if (error) {\r\n                reject(error);\r\n              } else {\r\n                resolve(&#39;Success&#39;);\r\n              }\r\n              smtpTransport.close();\r\n            });\r\n    });\r\n    };\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216290/how-to-include-this-nodemailer-function-inside-this-controller-function/58217621#58217621","title":"How to include this nodemailer function inside this controller function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":315,"user_id":7603484,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/814353ac5fdbb790297cd5511fceb118?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NewTech Lover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603484/newtech-lover"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58216679,"answer_count":4,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570099990,"creation_date":1570095397,"question_id":58216290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58216290","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a form that will send data to the Mongo DB first then will send that data through the email by Nodemailer.

documentation from the link about GraphDB Javascript Functions uses an non-existing function `xsd:date`. For some reason it didn&#39;t end in the release.\r\n\r\nSome technical notes. \r\n\r\nThe RDF values passed as arguments to the user defined javascript functions undergo a type conversion. The instances of `org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.IRI` and `org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.BNode` are passed &quot;as-is&quot;, but the Literals are converted like: \r\n\r\n- if it is an integer datatype e.g. one of (xsd:integer, xsd:long, xsd:int, xsd:byte, xsd:short, xsd:nonPositiveInteger, xsd:negativeInteger, xsd:nonNegativeInteger, xsd:positiveInteger, xsd:unsignedLong, xsd:unsignedInt, xsd:unsignedShort and xsd:unsignedByte) the value passed is a `long`\r\n \r\n- if it is one of: xsd:decimal, xsd:float or xsd:double the value passed is a  `double`\r\n\r\n- if it is one of: xsd:dateTime, xsd:date, xsd:time, xsd:gYearMonth, xsd:gMonthDay, xsd:gYear, xsd:gMonth or xsd:gDay the value passed is an instance of `javax.xml.datatype.XMLGregorianCalendar`\r\n\r\n- if it is a duration, e.g. one of: xsd:duration, xsd:dayTimeDuration or xsd:yearMonthDuration the value passed is an instance of `javax.xml.datatype.Duration` \r\n\r\n- finally, for xsd:boolean is a `boolean`\r\n\r\n- for anything else, the Literal&#39;s label as `String`\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the return value is also converted.\r\nIf it is an instance of `org.eclipse.rdf4j.Value`, no conversion is done.\r\nOtherwise, conversion to RDF literal depends on its type and also on what is avaliable in RDF4J `ValueFactory` as `createLiteral` methods that can handle these, including the `XMLGregorianCalendar`. So if there is no specific handler, the string value of the result is used to create the Literal. \r\n\r\nIn the example from the first answer, the result of `jsfn:convertDate` is of type `jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeDate` so when the literal of the result is created, the plugin invokes its `toString` and that lead to results like `[Date 2011-02-02T14:45:14.000Z]` \r\n\r\nFurther, the scripting engine in the plugin is restricted to have access only to classes starting with `java.lang.` (excluding `java.lang.Thread`), `org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.` and `com.ontotext.trree.sdk.` \r\n\r\nHaving in mind the above notes and restrictions, a javascript function that converts a `xsd:dateTime` to `xsd:date` need to set the fields of the calendar value which are related to the time to `DatatypeConstants.FIELD_UNDEFINED` which is actually `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and construct a Literal through the RDF4J `ValueFactory`:\r\n\r\n    PREFIX jsfn:&lt;http://www.ontotext.com/js#&gt;\r\n    INSERT DATA {\r\n        [] jsfn:register &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n        function convertDate(value) {\r\n    \t\tvalue.setTime(java.lang.Integer.MIN_VALUE, java.lang.Integer.MIN_VALUE, java.lang.Integer.MIN_VALUE);\r\n    \t\treturn org.eclipse.rdf4j.model.impl.SimpleValueFactory.getInstance().createLiteral(value);\r\n        }\r\n    &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHTH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58216278/how-to-convert-xsddatetime-literal-into-xsddate-in-graphdb/58235609#58235609","title":"How to convert xsd:dateTime literal into

will be the best way to have a full-screen div between my content and my popup?\r\n\r\nMy issue is that I have my page but when the user logins for the first time I want to add a guide highlighting some components and showing an information window and that is done and working, however, the user still able to click on the links in the page and I don&#39;t want it to happen before he finishes the guide so I decided to add a full-screen div in the page.\r\n\r\nAfter adding the div with the following CSS:\r\n\r\n```\r\n.backgroundDiv {\r\n  display: block;\r\n  height: 100%;\r\n  left: 0;\r\n  opacity: 1;\r\n  position: fixed;\r\n  text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;\r\n  top: 0;\r\n  transition: opacity .5s ease-in-out;\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n  z-index: 100000;\r\n  overflow-x: auto;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt works but when my guide highlights some component that is out of view, it does:\r\n`element.nativeElement.scrollIntoView({block: &#39;end&#39;, behavior: &#39;smooth&#39;});`\r\n\r\nBut the scrolling is being applied to the background div instead of my main page and it is breaking the feature.\r\n\r\nMy popup HTML is something like:\r\n```\r\n&lt;ng-container&gt;\r\n  &lt;div *ngIf=&quot;display&quot; class=&quot;backgroundDiv&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ng-container *ngIf=&quot;display&quot;&gt;\r\n     (...) // Popup HTML\r\n    &lt;/ng-container&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/ng-container&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: Is there a way to find out the actual size that my page has? Everything that I could find just gives me the user screen at max.
