This will cause the first 10 Fibonacci numbers to actually be computed and stored in memory, and they will stay in memory for the duration of the program.

It is a so-called eta-expansion of the previous function, and is *semantically* equivalent to it. Yet, operationally, this has drastically worse performance, since memoization here does not take place.\r\n\r\nWhy? Well, your function defines the list `map fib [0..]` _before_ taking the (implicit) input parameter `m`, so there is only one list around, for all `m` we may pass later on as arguments. Instead, in `not_memoized_fib` we first take `m` as input, and then define the list, making the function create a list for every call to `not_memoized_fib`, destroying performance.\r\n\r\nIt is even easier to see if we use `let` and lambdas instead of `where`.

just started a Developer apprenticeship, and I&#39;ve been tasked with creating automated integration tests for the company&#39;s software using Postman. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve spent 2.5 weeks trying to learn all about Postman and the software, and I&#39;m still struggling with how to construct these tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, the software allows you to add an item (with several data fields) into a database. I want to create a test collection that allows me to run requests that create a new entry, update that entry, and delete that entry. I&#39;ve got a get request (GetItems), a post request (NewItem), an update request (UpdateItem), and a delete request (DeleteItem). \r\n\r\nHow do I set this up so that the NewItem request creates an id variable that can be used to update and delete in subsequent requests? \r\n\r\nSo far, the only thing I&#39;ve gotten to work is hard-coding sample data for each item field into the body of the request. This means I then have to edit that data manually in the update and delete requests, and it only works about half the time I run the requests. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve researched this for several days now, and can&#39;t make heads or tails of how to make Postman do what I&#39;m trying to do. \r\n\r\nAny ideas or advice would be amazing, I really want to learn and create useful tests for my new team.

I have both the search and the input prompt working separately but not together. I will show you what I mean. And maybe someone can tell me how to properly pass the date to pandas for the search.\r\n\r\nThis is how I successfully use pandas to extract rows in an excel sheet if any cell in column emr_first_access_date is greater than or equal to &#39;2019-09-08&#39;\r\n\r\nI do this successfully with the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nHISorigFile = &quot;C:\\\\folder\\\\inputfile1.xlsx&quot;\r\n#opens excel worksheet\r\ndf = pd.read_excel(HISorigFile, sheet_name=&#39;Non Live&#39;, skiprows=8)\r\n#locates the columns I want to write to file including  date column emr_first_access_date if greater than or equal to &#39;2019-09-08&#39;\r\ndata = df.loc[df[&#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;] &gt;= &#39;2019-09-08&#39;, [&#39;site_name&#39;,&#39;subs_num&#39;,&#39;emr_id&#39;, &#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;]]\r\n#sorts the data\r\ndatasort = data.sort_values(&quot;emr_first_access_date&quot;,ascending=False)\r\n#this creates the file (data already sorted) in panda with date and time. \r\ndatasort.to_excel(r&#39;C:\\\\folder\\sitesTestedInLastWeek.xlsx&#39;, index=False, header=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the date above is hardcoded of course. So, I need the user running this script to input the date. I created a very basic working input prompt with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport datetime\r\n#prompts for input date\r\nTestedDateBegin = input(&#39;Enter beginning date to search for sites tested in YYYY-MM-DD format&#39;)\r\nyear, month, day = map(int, TestedDateBegin.split(&#39;-&#39;))\r\ndate1 = datetime.date(year, month, day)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously I want to pass TestedDateBegin to pandas, changing the pertinent code line:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = df.loc[df[&#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;] &gt;= &#39;2019-09-08&#39;, [&#39;site_name&#39;,&#39;subs_num&#39;,&#39;emr_id&#39;, &#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nto something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata = df.loc[df[b][&#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;] &gt;= &#39;TestedDateBegin&#39;, [&#39;site_name&#39;,&#39;subs_num&#39;,&#39;emr_id&#39;, &#39;emr_first_access_date&#39;]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this doesn&#39;t work. But how do I proceed? I am very new to programming so I not always clear how to proceed. Does the date inputted in TestedDateBegin need to be added to a return? Or should it be put in a single item list? What is the right approach?

And it is not possible to modify the hash later, because the original code has too much values, that must be changed...\r\n\r\nBoth machines uses DBI 1.642 and DBIx::Log4perl 0.26\r\n\r\nThe only difference is the perl version machine 1 (v5.26.1) vs. machine 2 (v5.14.2)\r\n\r\nSo the big question is, how can I make sure I always get the integer in the hash as the result?\r\n\r\n\r\n**Update 10.10.2019:**\r\n\r\nTo show perhaps better the problem, i improve the above example:\r\n\r\n```perl\r\n...\r\nuse Data::Dumper;\r\nuse JSON;  # &lt;-- Inserted\r\nuse utf8;\r\n...\r\n\r\n...\r\nprint Dumper($row);\r\n\r\n# JSON Output\r\nprint JSON::to_json($row).&quot;\\n&quot;; # &lt;-- Inserted\r\n\r\n$dbh-&gt;disconnect;\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the output on machine 1 with last line the JSON Output:\r\n```bash\r\narties@p51s:~$ perl hashTest.pl \r\nLog4perl: Seems like no initialization happened. Forgot to call init()?\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          &#39;1&#39; =&gt; 1\r\n        };\r\n{&quot;1&quot;:1}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the output on machine 2 with last line the JSON Output:\r\n```bash\r\narties@core3:~$ perl hashTest.pl\r\n$VAR1 = {\r\n          &#39;1&#39; =&gt; &#39;1&#39;\r\n        };\r\n{&quot;1&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou see, that both Data::Dumper AND JSON has the same behavor. And as i wrote bevor, +0 is not an option because the original hash is much more complex.\r\n\r\nBoth machines use JSON 4.02\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312325/perl-fetchrow-hashref-results-are-different-integer-vs-string-values","title":"Perl fetchrow_hashref results are different integer vs. string values"},{"tags":["python","markdown"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1378,"user_id":7554868,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_q0V6XZcS5c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABeM/Bmdf1MpnjTQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jammy Dodger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7554868/jammy-dodger"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570655275,"post_id":58312324,"comment_id":102985701,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312324/can-the-python-markdown-approximate-github-markdown-by-installing-extensions#comment102985701_58312324"},{"owner":{"reputation":770,"user_id":7212665,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KrLoI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Demi-Lune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7212665/demi-lune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570658280,"post_id":58312324,"comment_id":102986638,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312324/can-the-python-markdown-approximate-github-markdown-by-installing-extensions#comment102986638_58312324"},{"owner":{"reputation":1135,"user_id":62709,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/002c19193e3976723d5681cf4864bebb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stuart Axon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62709/stuart-axon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570699435,"post_id":58312324,"comment_id":102998440,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312324/can-the-python-markdown-approximate-github-markdown-by-installing-extensions#comment102998440_58312324"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1135,"user_id":62709,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/002c19193e3976723d5681cf4864bebb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stuart Axon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62709/stuart-axon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570741930,"post_id":58330642,"comment_id":103020106,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312324/can-the-python-markdown-approximate-github-markdown-by-installing-extensions/58330642#comment103020106_58330642"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15263,"user_id":866026,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96fae8527632d33d7bf929fada83e8d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Waylan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/866026/waylan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570739397,"creation_date":1570739397,"answer_id":58330642,"question_id":58312324,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58330642","body_markdown":"&gt; Can the python-markdown approximate github markdown by installing extensions?\r\n\r\nMostly yes. Note that GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM) is built on Commonmark and Python-Markdown is **not** a Commonmark implementation. Therefore, any differences between Commonmark and the [original Markdown rules][0] would need to be addressed by extensions. Those differences are all documented in the Commonmark [spec][1]. However, of concern is Commonmark&#39;s indentation. It is not likely that Python-Markdown could be adapted to match the exact behavior of the Commonmark spec on this point. That said, for most any &quot;well formed&quot; Markdown, it should be doable.\r\n\r\nThen on top of adapting Python-Markdown to Commonmark, you would need extensions to match the various extensions provided by GFM, which are all defined in GitHub&#39;s [spec][2] (the extensions are all highlighted with a blue background). Note that while Fenced Code Blocks are part of Commonmark, and therefore are not an extension to GFM, they are not part of the original Markdown rules and therefore would require use of the [Fenced Code Block extension][3].\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there a list of extensions that adds python-markdown the syntax additions from github flavoured markdown ?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve never seen such a list, which would be off-topic here anyway. That said, you can find a list of all [built-in extensions][4] in the Python-Markdown documentation and a list of all [known third-party extensions][5] on the project&#39;s wiki. I expect you will find extensions which add of of GFM&#39;s add-on behavior, but it will be more difficult to find extensions which match Commonmark&#39;s base behavior.

It compiles, it solves the problem, and it&#39;s probably not going to be a performance bottleneck (unless there are many folders). However, good for you for looking on ways to improve. BTW, there&#39;s a stack exchange site for that - [codereview.stackexchange.com][1].\r\n\r\nTo improve the efficiency a bit, I&#39;d pre-process the folders so I wouldn&#39;t have to iterate over the whole list every time to find the parent by its id. Just put the folders in a `Map&lt;Integer, Folder&gt;` (use the ID as key) so it&#39;ll be easy and quick to find the parent folder by id. \r\n\r\nTo improve readability, I&#39;d also replace the recursion with a simple loop.

From the docs:\r\n\r\n&gt; At a high level, what happens during the whole bootstrap and build\r\n&gt; process is:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  1. Node objects are sourced from whatever sources you defined in gatsby-config.js with plugins as well as in your gatsby-node.js file\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;  2. A schema is inferred from the Node objects\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;  3. Pages are created based off JavaScript components in your site or in installed themes\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;  4. **GraphQL queries are extracted and run to provide data for all pages**\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;  5. Static files are created and bundled in the public directory\r\n\r\nTLDR: In order for gatsby to build properly all your graphql exports have to be in order.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/overview-of-the-gatsby-build-process/#what-happens-when-you-run-gatsby-build","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312296/gatsy-page-query-fails-to-work-when-using-named-export-at-the-end-of-the-page-w/58333633#58333633","title":"Gatsy page query fails to work when using named export at the end of the page.

You will have to implement your own logic. Specifically, you either have access to all of the properties of your `ChangeNotifier` implementation because you add the listener in its scope or you have access to it because you have a reference to it in your scope.\r\n\r\n[`ChangeNotifier`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html) simply implements [`Listenable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html) and provides some utilities for managing listeners. Furthermore, the documentation states the following about it:\r\n\r\n&gt; [ChangeNotifier](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ChangeNotifier-class.html) is optimized for small numbers (one or two) of listeners. It is O(N) for adding and removing listeners and O(N&#178;) for dispatching notifications (where N is the number of listeners).\r\n\r\nI am not sure about options with better runtime complexity for notifying listeners, but you will not run into any issues in a regular Flutter app.\r\n\r\n## ValueNotifier\r\n\r\n[`ValueNotifier`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ValueNotifier-class.html) is a pre-made implementation of `ChangeNotifier` that will notify its listeners when its [`value` property](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/ValueNotifier/value.html) is changed.  \r\nThis is sufficient for most case, but since it appears that you want to create a custom `ChangeNotifier`, you can use the [source code of `ValueNotifier`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/3c521fb980104d7e1b5488fcf9dc8b37fd282be6/packages/flutter/lib/src/foundation/change_notifier.dart#L257) to take a look at an example implementation (it is very straight forward).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you are just looking to do state management in general, `ValueNotifier`s usually work great. However, they are not applicable in every scenario. Hence, here is an [extensive list with different state management options](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/data-and-backend/state-mgmt/options).  \r\nConsidering the questions, I think the techniques that fit your needs best and the most popular options are the following:\r\n\r\n * [InheritedWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedWidget-class.html) as it lets you notify dependents based on what data changed. Additionally, there is [InheritedModel](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedModel-class.html) as an extension of this and [InheritedNotifier](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/InheritedModel-class.html) that works with [`Listenable`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/foundation/Listenable-class.html), just like `ChangeNotifier` does.  \r\n\r\n * The [BLOC](https://medium.com/flutterpub/architecting-your-flutter-project-bd04e144a8f1) pattern, which works with streams.\r\n\r\n * The [`provider` package](https://pub.dev/packages/provider) which is mostly a convenience wrapper for various Flutter state management techniques (`InheritedWidget`, `StatefulWidget`, `ValueNotifier`, etc.).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312255/how-do-i-use-changenotifier/58312587#58312587","title":"How do I use

More specifically, I have 4 columns (M, H, A, &amp; F) from which I need to selectively copy cells based on the same-row value of Column I. E.g. with the below case:\r\n```\r\nWorksheets 2...N  \r\nColumn A_____Column F_____Column H_____Column I_____Column M  \r\n_#####________AAAAAA______AAAAAA_______Rqrmnt_______Date\r\n_#####________AAAAAA______AAAAAA_______Heading_______Blank\r\n```\r\nFor all rows with column I = Rqrmnt across N worksheets, I need to copy the corresponding values in columns A, F, H, and M into worksheet 1, stacking the imports of each sheet top-to-bottom, e.g.:\r\n```\r\nWorksheet 2 Column A...Worksheet 2 Column M  \r\nWorksheet 3 Column A...Worksheet 3 Column M  \r\n... \r\nWorksheet N Column A...Worksheet N Column M  \r\n```\r\nI need to be able to perform limited manipulation on the resulting table, specifically sorting the rows by the value of Column M  \r\n\r\nAs I have several hundred such entries, I would prefer to not build this up by linking cells 1-by-1.

So Im receiving zipCodes and out of this storing this address object:\r\n\r\n    address: {\r\n    suburb: &quot;Neuk&#246;lln&quot;,\r\n    city_district: &quot;Neuk&#246;lln&quot;,\r\n    city: &quot;Berlin&quot;,\r\n    state: &quot;Berlin&quot;,\r\n    postcode: &quot;12053&quot;,\r\n    country: &quot;Deutschland&quot;,\r\n    country_code: &quot;de&quot;,\r\n    lat: &quot;52.4775104&quot;,\r\n    lon: &quot;13.4322809163976&quot;,\r\n    displayName: &quot;Neuk&#246;lln, Berlin, 12053, Deutschland&quot;\r\n    },\r\n\r\nThe user in the frontend then uses autosuggest based on komoot api which gives me something in following format:\r\n\r\n    city: &quot;Berlin&quot;\r\n    country: &quot;Deutschland&quot;\r\n    name: &quot;Berlin&quot;\r\n    osm_id: 240109189\r\n    osm_key: &quot;place&quot;\r\n    osm_type: &quot;N&quot;\r\n    osm_value: &quot;city&quot;\r\n    postcode: &quot;10117&quot;\r\n    state: &quot;Berlin&quot;\r\n\r\nAs you can see I can search now with osm_value and name. So I would search city:Berlin.\r\n\r\nTheoretically this works quite well. But for bigger cities like Berlin nominatim and komoot are giving very bad results. Often times with nomnatim city is missing even tough there is a city_district. (See this issue: https://github.com/openstreetmap/Nominatim/issues/1487)\r\n\r\nMy question would be: How could a proper data structure look like and do you have a better idea to build this? Paid services are fine - I just haven&#39;t found one proper (besides extremely expensive gmaps).\r\n\r\nRequirements are:\r\nSearch for zipCode, city, city_district, village, town, county\r\n\r\nHaving roughly 300k geocodings per month\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312229/how-to-best-store-and-search-address","title":"How to best store and search address?"},{"tags":["python","list","dictionary"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":186531,"user_id":674039,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/leoFi.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/674039/wim"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570655148,"post_id":58312225,"comment_id":102985648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312225/how-can-i-convert-a-list-of-lists-to-a-dictionary-whose-keys-are-integers-and-va#comment102985648_58312225"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24719,"user_id":4001592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXDU3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Mesejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001592/daniel-mesejo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24719,"user_id":4001592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CXDU3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Mesejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001592/daniel-mesejo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570655319,"last_edit_date":1570655319,"creation_date":1570655004,"answer_id":58312272,"question_id":58312225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312272","body_markdown":"You could use [enumerate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#enumerate) + a [dictionary comprehension](https://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/comprehensions/dict_comprehension.html):\r\n\r\n    L = [[0, 4, 5], [2, 3], [1, 6]]\r\n    result = {value: i for i, values in enumerate(L) for value in values}\r\n    print(result)\r\n**Output**\r\n\r\n    {0: 0, 4: 0, 5: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 1: 2, 6: 2}\r\n\r\nWhich is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n    result = {}\r\n    for i, values in enumerate(L):\r\n        for value in values:\r\n            result[value] = i\r\n\r\nThe key here, in my opinion, is to use enumerate to access the indices and the elements of `L`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312225/how-can-i-convert-a-list-of-lists-to-a-dictionary-whose-keys-are-integers-and-va/58312272#58312272","title":"How can I convert a list of lists to a dictionary whose keys are integers and values are the index of the sublist to which the integer belongs?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":181,"user_id":11196108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5a1ec3c09309cb74231ec021f99047b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ymochurad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11196108/ymochurad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":181,"user_id":11196108,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5a1ec3c09309cb74231ec021f99047b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ymochurad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11196108/ymochurad"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570655642,"last_edit_date":1570655642,"creation_date":1570655265,"answer_id":58312330,"question_id":58312225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312330","body_markdown":"    L=[[0,4,5],[2,3],[1,6]]\r\n\r\n    result = dict()\r\n    for i,l  in enumerate(L):\r\n      for item in l:\r\n        result[item]=i\r\n\r\n    print(result)\r\n\r\nThis will produce output like:\r\n\r\n    {0: 0, 1: 2, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 2}\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312225/how-can-i-convert-a-list-of-lists-to-a-dictionary-whose-keys-are-integers-and-va/58312330#58312330","title":"How can I convert a list of lists to a dictionary whose keys are integers and values are the index of the sublist to which the integer belongs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":8162211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-xe3KddExZ-I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAkk/qmiAB1NDOXk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"fishbacp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8162211/fishbacp"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58312330,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570655642,"creation_date":1570654819,"question_id":58312225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58312225","body_markdown":"I have a list of lists, where each integer 0..N belongs to exactly one list within the outer list.

language-all: lang-sql --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe definition of &quot;fillup&quot; is a bit vague. I&#39;ll assume it&#39;s a fillup when the fuel value rises by more than *50*. Replace with a number of your choosing. And it seems like a new tank must start with `fuel = 100` (though that&#39;s an odd condition). I added that as comment - uncomment to activate:\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM  (\r\n       SELECT *, count(*) FILTER (WHERE fillup) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY id) AS tank\r\n       FROM  (\r\n          SELECT *\r\n               , fuel - lag(fuel, 1, 0) OVER (PARTITION BY device_id ORDER BY id) &gt; 50\r\n                 -- AND fuel = 100  -- additional condition(s)?\r\n                 AS fillup\r\n          FROM   tbl\r\n          ) sub1\r\n       ) sub2\r\n    WHERE  device_id = 19\r\n    AND    tank = 1;\r\n\r\n\r\n*db&lt;&gt;fiddle [here](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_12&amp;fiddle=d5808a42c90f834b75c8f6eb46f611bf)*\r\n\r\nIn the subquery **`sub1`**, compute the difference between the preceding fuel entry per device and the current one - using the [window function **`lag()`**][1]. Notably, I use the variant with 3 parameters, providing *0* as default for missing rows to cover the first row per partition. An increase of more than 50 indicates a new fillup.\r\n\r\nIn subquery **`sub2`**, count the number of fillups over time with another window function, thereby assigning a &quot;tank&quot; number to every row.\r\n\r\nIn the outer `SELECT`, pick your device and the number of the &quot;tank&quot; filling. Voil&#225;.\r\n\r\nIf you move the condition `WHERE  device_id = 19` to the innermost suqbquery, you can drop the `PARTITION` clauses. Faster, less versatile.\r\n\r\nAbout the `FILTER` clause:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27136251/how-can-i-simplify-this-game-statistics-query/27141193#27141193\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41796929/conditional-lead-lag-function-postgresql/41797399#41797399\r\n\r\n### Only get last tank for given device\r\n\r\nAccording to your comment, defined by &quot;last time tank was filled from 20 or below to 100&quot;.\r\n\r\nI assume that later points in time correspond to higher `id` values. (Be aware that there can be corner case complications with serial columns under concurrent write load.)\r\n\r\nThe simplest way: **just reverse the order** and count from the bottom:\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM  (\r\n       SELECT *, count(*) FILTER (WHERE fillup) OVER (ORDER BY id DESC) AS tank\r\n      FROM  (\r\n          SELECT *, lag(fuel, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY id DESC) = 100\r\n                    AND fuel &lt;= 20 AS fillup\r\n          FROM   tbl\r\n          WHERE  device_id = 19\r\n          ) sub1\r\n       ) sub2\r\n    WHERE  tank = 0\r\n    -- ORDER  BY id  -- optional to get result in ascending order\r\n\r\n*db&lt;&gt;fiddle [here](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=postgres_12&amp;fiddle=659358f7a727bd3d0202f0b35f9f2ca5)*\r\n\r\nFor this, it&#39;s probably faster to walk through rows procedurally as that only needs a single pass and can stop immediately after the first tank is found.  \r\nSupport it with an index on `tbl(device_id, id DESC)`.\r\n\r\nExample code:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8014577/group-by-and-aggregate-sequential-numeric-values/8014694#8014694\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55173406/how-to-number-consecutive-records-per-island?noredirect=1&amp;lq=1\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-window.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312219/find-all-rows-in-between-a-set-in-postgresql/58314630#58314630","title":"Find all rows in between a set in PostgreSQL"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570675678,"last_edit_date":1570675678,"creation_date":1570675281,"answer_id":58314704,"question_id":58312219,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314704","body_markdown":"```\r\nSELECT min(id) AS first_id,\r\n       max(id) AS last_id,\r\n       deviceid\r\nFROM (SELECT id, deviceid, fuel,\r\n             count(*) FILTER (WHERE refilled)\r\n                OVER (PARTITION BY deviceid ORDER BY id DESC) AS filling\r\n      FROM (SELECT id, deviceid, fuel,\r\n                   fuel &lt;

I am not going to spend time delving into the why, partly because it&#39;s complex, partly because I don&#39;t know the full intricacies of `istream` behavior.\r\n\r\nWhat I will say is that if you want to handle a multi-character input, use cin.get() everywhere and not just sometimes. You can do processing of each character, but again, nothing will go to the screen until the user presses Enter.\r\n\r\nBut here&#39;s code that appears to work:\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;cctype&gt;  // isalpha() and isalnum()\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;  // ch is now a std::string\r\n// ...\r\ncase IDENTIFIER_CHOICE:\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please enter an identifier and press [Enter] immediately after.  &quot;;\r\n\r\n    std::cin.ignore(256, &#39;\\n&#39;);  // needed because of getline behavior\r\n    std::getline(std::cin, ch);\r\n    if (!(isalpha(ch[0]) || ch[0] == &#39;_&#39;)) {\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Not valid.\\n&quot;;\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 1; i &lt; ch.size(); ++i) {\r\n        if (!isalnum(ch[i])) {\r\n            cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Not valid.\\n&quot;;\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Valid.\\n&quot;;\r\n    break;\r\n// ...\r\n```\r\nWith `cin`, when you press Enter, that keystroke is saved in the input stream. `getline()` doesn&#39;t behave the way we expect because while `cin` will typically ignore that keystroke, `getline` does not. So I just tell `cin` to ignore an arbitrary (but sufficient in this case) amount of characters in the stream up to and including the Enter keystroke (Mac and Linux, should still behave for Windows (I think)). \r\n\r\nThis is still far from bulletproof input validation (that&#39;s impossible), but I think it suffices for what you&#39;re working on.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312202/c-while-loop-insight-request/58312701#58312701","title":"C++ while loop insight request"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12191441,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/70c6b10cfc62af43ae7fac7b7dc3c645?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Boxsteam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191441/boxsteam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43551,"user_id":44729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tyWaU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"genpfault","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/44729/genpfault"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570657400,"creation_date":1570654727,"last_edit_date":1570657400,"question_id":58312202,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58312202","body_markdown":"basically I am having weird trouble with my while loop near the beginning of the program which checks for user validation on their choice of activity.

Rather than look up what support is available from various operating systems, though, I would propose that your approach is flawed.\r\n\r\nDebugging typically uses a debug build that has most optimizations turned off (to make it easier to do things like set breakpoints accurately). Timings on a non-optimized build lack practical value. Hence any timings of your program should usually be ignored when you are using breakpoints&amp;ndash;even if the breakpoint is outside the timed section.\r\n\r\nTo combine using breakpoints with timings, I would do the debugging in two phases. In one phase, you set breakpoints and look at what is happening in the debug build. In the other phase, you use identical input (redirect a file into `std::cin` if it helps) and time the process in the release build. There may be some back-and-forth between the stages as you work out what is going on. That&#39;s fine; the point is not to have exactly two phases, but to keep breakpoints and timings separate.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312194/c-c-elapsed-process-cycles-not-including-at-breakpoints/58313965#58313965","title":"C/C++ elapsed process cycles, not including at breakpoints"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9005776,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X7XkgjzojQ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABQk/5IrfXRyNwt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michael Colsch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9005776/michael-colsch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9005776,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X7XkgjzojQ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABQk/5IrfXRyNwt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michael Colsch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9005776/michael-colsch"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570669119,"last_edit_date":1570669119,"creation_date":1570668804,"answer_id":58314009,"question_id":58312194,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314009","body_markdown":"Although JaMit gives a better answer ([here][1]), it is possible but it depends entirely on your compiler and the amount of overhead this creates will probably slow down your program too much to get an accurate result.

would need some method on the server side (cloud function) to give me a &#39;changing&#39; url when an image is updated with same file name.

When thumbnails are generated, I store the download urls on firestore for access in my mobile app\r\n\r\nAs per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58310843/difference-between-getsignedurl-and-getdownloadurl I use getSignedUrl(). \r\n\r\nBut this method gives me &#39;same&#39; url even when the underlying image changes.

Also, clicking the button to execute requestPermission on that screen will do nothing, as the OS will block requestPermission().\r\n\r\nIn the examples I have seen, requestPermission is called whenever the permission is not enabled (with no custom screen like this); and so either the dialog pops up, or it doesn&#39;t. However, in the flow that I am trying to achieve, I want to navigate to this custom screen *only* if the user does not have permission because they have not been asked. If they have been asked and declined, they should not be navigated to that screen.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to achieve that using the functions in firebase.messaging(), or do I have to use persistent storage like async-storage to track on my own whether the dialog has been shown?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312176/how-to-know-if-firebase-messaging-requestpermission-has-been-previously-called","title":"How to know if firebase.messaging().requestPermission has been previously called using react-native-firebase"},{"tags":["ssis","wql"],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":11380579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aFiSwzhE2GE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reDt9FKt2eNlyE0UXj7OY74RFlbsQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mason Chambers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11380579/mason-chambers"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570654606,"creation_date":1570654606,"question_id":58312173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58312173","body_markdown":"I have a WMI Event watcher Task that watches for the creation of a file in a folder.

So which technique or algorithm can i use to solve this problem.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312147/unlabeled-text-data-containing-messages","title":"Unlabeled text data containing messages"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570654943,"post_id":58312145,"comment_id":102985572,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312145/path-to-input-files-in-vs-2019#comment102985572_58312145"},{"owner":{"reputation":7054,"user_id":487892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Leb5B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"drescherjm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/487892/drescherjm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570655674,"post_id":58312145,"comment_id":102985847,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312145/path-to-input-files-in-vs-2019#comment102985847_58312145"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9005776,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-X7XkgjzojQ0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABQk/5IrfXRyNwt4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Michael Colsch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9005776/michael-colsch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7054,"user_id":487892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Leb5B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"drescherjm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/487892/drescherjm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570655749,"last_edit_date":1570655749,"creation_date":1570655064,"answer_id":58312276,"question_id":58312145,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312276","body_markdown":"![Visual Studio Working Directory][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/iQLFd.png\r\n\r\nThere is a setting in the current project settings for working directory.\r\nWhen you build a project in visual studio, the executable is run in this directory, regardless of which directory the executable is in.\r\nThe working directory is found under Project Settings &gt;&gt; Configuration Properties &gt;&gt; Debugging\r\nMore information about properties pages: \r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/working-with-project-properties?view=vs-2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312145/path-to-input-files-in-vs-2019/58312276#58312276","title":"Path to input files in VS 2019"}],"owner":{"reputation":180,"user_id":1505713,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c325b88c929eab279dfbd4e5f4e8c26e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1505713","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1505713/user1505713"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58312276,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570655749,"creation_date":1570654490,"question_id":58312145,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58312145","body_markdown":"Visual Studio does not seem to be finding input files when I try to compile under &quot;Debug&quot;:\r\n\r\n    /* in.dat exists in \r\n    \r\n    \\ProjectName\\\r\n    \\ProjectName\\Debug\\\r\n    \\Debug\\\r\n\r\n    */\r\n\r\n    string name = &quot;in.dat&quot;;\r\n    ifstream ifs(name); // nullptr...\r\n\r\n\r\nAre there specific places VS looks for input files?

I created Apple Pay feature for my website and it has been working great in Safari browser in iOS devices but stopped working after updating the iOS to the latest version, iOS13.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that the Apple Pay sheet no longer appears on iOS13.\r\nI do not see any errors in the logs.

There is no `computerName` attribute. The attribute you&#39;re after is called [`sAMAccountName`][1], which is the same attribute used for the username for user accounts. However, for computers, it is the computer name followed by the `$` character. So your search should look like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\r\n\r\n    (&amp;(objectClass=computer)(sAMAccountName=MACHINE_NAME$))\r\n\r\n2. Attribute names never have spaces. You want the [`canonicalName`][2] attribute. I see you are assigning it to a property called `OU`. Just be aware that the `canonicalName` includes the name of the object itself at the end, not just the OU.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- --&gt;\r\n\r\n    search.PropertiesToLoad.Add(&quot;canonicalName&quot;);\r\n    ...\r\n    objSurveyComputers.OU = (String)result.Properties[&quot;canonicalName&quot;][0];\r\n\r\n3. You are calling `.Dispose()` on a couple objects, which is fine (although not absolutely needed). But the most important one to dispose is `resultCol`, because the [documentation for `SearchResultCollection`][3] says:\r\n\r\n&gt;Due to implementation restrictions, the SearchResultCollection class cannot release all of its unmanaged resources when it is garbage collected. To prevent a memory leak, you must call the Dispose method when the SearchResultCollection object is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nYou can also put it in a [`using` statement][4] instead of calling `.Dispose()` manually, which would have the same effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-samaccountname\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-canonicalname\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.searchresultcollection?view=netframework-4.8\r\n  [4]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58312129/list-not-outputting-any-data-system-directoryservices/58313206#58313206","title":"List not outputting any data (System.DirectoryServices)"}],"owner":{"reputation":131,"user_id":10624812,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922b3e027d151b5d3ef62a8984bb0c7f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rad_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10624812/rad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58313206,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570660980,"creation_date":1570654418,"last_edit_date":1570655048,"question_id":58312129,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58312129","body_markdown":"I currently have a method that queries for Canonical Name and the CN of a specified machine.
