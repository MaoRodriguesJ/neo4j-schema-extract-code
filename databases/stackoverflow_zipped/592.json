If you use `move`, instead of copying the whole string you just have a couple pointer/integer swaps.  This means it can be much faster.  It is safe to use `getline` to populate the moved from string on each iteration so there is no concern there ([source][1]).\r\n\r\nThe only way it isn&#39;t faster is if the string has short string optimization and if the data you are putting in the string is short enough to qualify for it.  Then you are dealing with an actually array of characters and you must do a copy since arrays cannot be moved.  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46673520/ok-to-use-stdgetline-with-a-moved-from-stdstring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400055/is-there-any-copy-when-constructing-a-vector-of-strings/58400132#58400132","title":"Is there any copy when constructing a vector of strings?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12196394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f12e17f4aadaea553a751f08e944e1a1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jojolatino","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12196394/jojolatino"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571164380,"creation_date":1571161507,"question_id":58400055,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400055","body_markdown":"The following code splits &quot;my string&quot; in a `vector&lt;string&gt;`:\r\n```cpp\r\nstd::stringstream ss{&quot;my string&quot;};\r\nstd::vector&lt;std::string&gt; vec;\r\nstd::string tmp;\r\n\r\nwhile (std::getline(ss, tmp, &#39; &#39;)) {\r\n  vec.push_back(tmp);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I understand is that `getline` writes its result into `tmp` and then `tmp` get pushed into the vector by copying it.

way:\r\n\r\n - `(?:Abb|Ms)` Match either `Abb` or `Ms` literally\r\n - `\\.\\s+` Match the literal `.` character, followed by one or more whitespace characters.\r\n - `\\d{1,3}` Match between 1 and 3 digits\r\n - `(?:,\\s+\\d{1,3}\\b)*` Match the following non-capture group any number of times:\r\n     - `,\\s+\\d{1,3}\\b` Match `,`, followed by a whitespace character one or more times, then by 1 to 3 digits and assert the end of the digit using a word boundary\r\n - `(*SKIP)` control verb that causes the regex to give up on the current match if it tries to backtrack past its position (which means that it did match this string and will prevent the second option from matching)\r\n - `(*FAIL)` control verb that forces this match to fail causing the current match to be excluded from the results\r\n\r\nThe second option is what actually matches: `\\b\\d{1,3}\\b` - match between 1 and 3 digits asserting each side as a word boundary.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf `\\b` doesn&#39;t properly match every location, you may want to replace `\\b` with `(?:(?&lt;=\\D)|^)` for preceding and `(?=\\D|$)` for proceeding word boundaries respectively:\r\n\r\n[See regex in use here][2]\r\n\r\n

requested in a comment (below), **here is a limited implementation for binary sequences only:**\r\n\r\n    eg.binary &lt;- function(n, digits=0:1) {\r\n      if (n &lt;= 0) return(matrix(0,0,0))\r\n      if (n == 1) return(matrix(digits, 2))\r\n      x &lt;- eg.binary(n-1)\r\n      rbind(cbind(digits[1], x), cbind(digits[2], x))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAfter taking care of an initial case that `R` cannot handle correctly, it treats the &quot;base case&quot; of n=1 and then recursively obtains all n-1-digit binary strings and prepends each digit to each of them.  The digits are prepended so that the binary strings end up in their usual lexicographic order (the same as `expand.grid`).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n&gt;     eg.binary(3)\r\n\r\n         [,1] [,2] [,3]\r\n    [1,]    0    0    0\r\n    [2,]    0    0    1\r\n    [3,]    0    1    0\r\n    [4,]    0    1    1\r\n    [5,]    1    0    0\r\n    [6,]    1    0    1\r\n    [7,]    1    1    0\r\n    [8,]    1    1    1\r\n\r\nA general explanation (with a more flexible solution) follows.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nDistill the problem down to the basic operation of tacking the values of an array `y` onto the rows of a dataframe `X`, associating a whole copy of `X` with each value (*via* `cbind`) and appending the whole lot (*via* `rbind`):\r\n\r\n    cross &lt;- function(X, y) {\r\n      do.call(&quot;rbind&quot;, lapply(y, function(z) cbind(X, z)))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n&gt;     cross(data.frame(A=1:2, b=letters[1:2]), c(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;))\r\n\r\n      A b z\r\n    1 1 a X\r\n    2 2 b X\r\n    3 1 a Y\r\n    4 2 b Y\r\n\r\n(Let&#39;s worry about the column names later.)\r\n\r\nThe recursive solution for a list of such arrays `y` assumes you have already carried out these operations for all but the last element of the list.  It has to start somewhere, which evidently consists of converting an array into a one-column data frame.  Thus:\r\n\r\n      eg_ &lt;- function(y) {\r\n        n &lt;- length(y)\r\n        if (n &lt;= 1) {\r\n          as.data.frame(y) \r\n        } else {\r\n          cross(eg_(y[-n]), y[[n]])\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWhy the funny name?  Because we might want to do some post-processing, such as giving the result nice names.  Here&#39;s a fuller implementation:\r\n\r\n    eg &lt;- function(y) {\r\n      # (Define `eg_` here to keep it local to `eg` if you like)\r\n      X &lt;- eg_(y)\r\n      names.default &lt;- paste0(&quot;Var&quot;, seq.int(length(y)))\r\n      if (is.null(names(y))) {\r\n        colnames(X) &lt;- names.default\r\n      } else {\r\n        colnames(X) &lt;- ifelse(names(y)==&quot;&quot;, names.default, names(y))\r\n      }\r\n      X\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n&gt;     eg(replicate(3, 0:1, simplify=FALSE))\r\n\r\n      Var1 Var2 Var3\r\n    1    0    0    0\r\n    2    1    0    0\r\n    3    0    1    0\r\n    4    1    1    0\r\n    5    0    0    1\r\n    6    1    0    1\r\n    7    0    1    1\r\n    8    1    1    1\r\n\r\n&gt;     eg(list(0:1, B=2:3))\r\n\r\n      Var1 B\r\n    1    0 2\r\n    2    1 2\r\n    3    0 3\r\n    4    1 3\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400824/how-to-create-matrix-of-all-2n-binary-sequences-of-length-n-using-recursion-in/58401191#58401191","title":"How to create matrix of all 2^n binary sequences of length n using recursion in R?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11357641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5409477a292b53d198cdebecf3fb46e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11357641/michael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571246210,"post_id":58418302,"comment_id":103179607,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400824/how-to-create-matrix-of-all-2n-binary-sequences-of-length-n-using-recursion-in/58418302#comment103179607_58418302"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":55,"user_id":11357641,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5409477a292b53d198cdebecf3fb46e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11357641/michael"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571245177,"creation_date":1571245177,"answer_id":58418302,"question_id":58400824,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418302","body_markdown":"Apparently this was the desired recursive code:\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nbinseq &lt;- function(n){\r\n  if(n == 1){\r\n    binmat &lt;- matrix(c(0,1), nrow = 2, ncol = 1)\r\n  }else if(n &gt; 1){\r\n    A &lt;- binseq(n-1)\r\n    B &lt;- cbind(rep(0, nrow(A)), A)\r\n    C &lt;- cbind(rep(1, nrow(A)), A)\r\n    binmat &lt;- rbind(B,C)\r\n  }\r\n  return(binmat)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically for n = 1 we create a [0, 1] matrix.

Also, what&#39;s the best practice here for seeing what will be changed, before making the change permanent?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400048/update-values-from-another-table","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Update values from another table"},{"tags":["domain-driven-design","cqrs","event-sourcing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":725,"user_id":10296119,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9512b71a521000002356a25078824d0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CPerson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10296119/cperson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571162287,"post_id":58400041,"comment_id":103145744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400041/how-to-update-bunch-of-data-with-event-sourcing#comment103145744_58400041"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26282,"user_id":54734,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea91774321962f70f19362f43568cda9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VoiceOfUnreason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/54734/voiceofunreason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571162922,"creation_date":1571162922,"answer_id":58400401,"question_id":58400041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400401","body_markdown":"&gt; In traditional application I would take some data such as name, date of birth etc. and put them into existing object; as I understand, in ES concept this approach is wrong,\r\n\r\nShort answer: that approach is fine -- what changes in event sourcing is how you keep track of the changes in your service.\r\n\r\nA way to think of a stream of events is a sequence of patch-documents.

You should google “event sourcing basics in azure” to find detailed articles, github projects, videos, and other responses to these questions.\r\n\r\nIn general, in Event Sourcing there two main ideas you need – Messages and Events.  A typical process (not the only option, but a common one) is as follows. A message is created by your UI which makes a request for a change to be made to an AR.  Validation for that message is done on the message creation source.  \r\n\r\nThe message is then sent to an API, where it is validated again since you can&#39;t trust all possible senders.  The request is processed, resulting in changes made to an AR.  An event is then created describing the changes made, and that event is placed on an event source (Azure Event Hub, Kafka, Kinesis, a DB, whatever). This list of events is kept forever and describes each and every change made to that AR throughout time, including the initial creation request.  To get the current state of the AR, just add up all the events.\r\n\r\nThe key idea that is confusing when learning Event Sourcing is the two different types of “events”.  Messages ask for a change to be made, Events record that a change has been made. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400041/how-to-update-bunch-of-data-with-event-sourcing/58407853#58407853","title":"How to update bunch of data with Event Sourcing"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":734,"user_id":318097,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3aff072553eb8df8ed3dde5892e00e05?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roman Eremin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/318097/roman-eremin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571216964,"creation_date":1571216964,"answer_id":58409719,"question_id":58400041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58409719","body_markdown":"As already answered, the batch update approach is fine. \r\n\r\nI suggest to focus on the event consumption code.

Say that I am a Robot and I can shoot people all around around me. But, the issue is I don&#39;t have a gun. I also don&#39;t understand how a gun works. But I know that a gun is an object which has a trigger which when pressed kills people. So, the code for this will look something like below:-\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Robot{\r\n   \r\n    public void ShootPeopleWith( weapon IWeapon ){\r\n        weapon.PressTrigger()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IWeapon{\r\n   PressTrigger()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou see the Robot expects anyone who wants it to shoot people to provide him with a weapon first. Now, he doesn&#39;t know what weapon. Whatever you provide me, it should have a trigger because I only know to press the trigger and I know it serves my purpose. If you provide me with something that doesn&#39;t have a trigger, I cannot function.\r\n\r\nNow, there comes a drone that instructs the Robot to shoot people. It also provides it with a gun.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Drone{\r\n    List&lt;Robots&gt; allRobotsInArea = someList\r\n\r\n    public void DelegateARobot(){\r\n        robot = select a robot from allRobotsInArea\r\n        IWeapon weapon = new MachineGun();    //procuring a machine gun\r\n        robot.ShootPeopleWith(weapon);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see here that IWeapon is an agreement between the Robot and Drone. It says that whatever you give me must have a trigger. So, machine gun must have a trigger. Let&#39;s implement few weapons:-\r\n```\r\npublic class MachineGun : IWeapon{\r\n    public void PressTrigger(){\r\n        Fire40RoundsPerSecond();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class Sniper() : IWeapon{\r\n    public void PressTrigger(){\r\n        SayQuackQauck();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Drone can now easily pass in any weapon like Sniper and MachineGun to the Robot.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class Pumpkin{\r\n    public void FreakPeopleOut(){\r\n        GlowInTheDark();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe drone cannot pass in a Pumpkin even though it can be used as a weapon as `robot.ShootPeopleWith(new Pumpkin());` because it doesn&#39;t have a trigger and breaches the contract that Robot expects.\r\n\r\nIn your case, the Android Operating System is possibly the Robot in the above story which expects anything of type INativePages so when it consumes your NativePages object, it will try to call StartActivityInAndroid(). It doesn&#39;t know the activity or how to start it, so you must specify it in the method. Pressing Alt + Enter in Windows will auto-generate this method for you. You will have to then write logic on how to Start the Activity in Android.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400040/does-not-implement-interface-member-startactivityinandroid/58401017#58401017","title":"Does not implement interface member StartActivityInAndroid"}],"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":10012733,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VrDdN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bruno Gomes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10012733/bruno-gomes"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58400119,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571166334,"creation_date":1571161433,"question_id":58400040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400040","body_markdown":"I am trying to open an activity in MainPage through dependency and have the following error:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/55iyy.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/azkqg.png\r\n\r\nCan you help me?

Is it just because this question has (likely) been answered or because it&#39;s considered obvious?  \r\n\r\nNow that that&#39;s out of the way...  \r\n\r\nNothing being executed on the CPU is from a &quot;process&quot; or anything else. They&#39;re all threads, scheduled and entirely managed by the kernel using a variety of algorithms to reach expected performance for any given application. The CPU only allows n threads, where n equals (cores * hyperthreads). In most cases hyperthreads will be 2 so you have double the core count to get logical CPU count. What this really means is that instead of 4 (for example) threads being run at once, it can support up to 8. Now the OS may have hundreds of threads at any given time, how is that possible? Well the kernel uses a variety of checks such as how frequently and long the thread sleeps to assign it a priority. Whenever the CPU triggers a timer interrupt the OS will swap out threads appropriately if they&#39;ve reached their alotted time slice based on the OS determination of its priority.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400016/what-is-the-relation-between-threads-and-concurrency/58408464#58408464","title":"What is the relation between threads and concurrency?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39172,"user_id":2805305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/442d249754d1725d9510cf06fa46b964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805305/bolov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39172,"user_id":2805305,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/442d249754d1725d9510cf06fa46b964?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"bolov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2805305/bolov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571214584,"last_edit_date":1571214584,"creation_date":1571214049,"answer_id":58408809,"question_id":58400016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58408809","body_markdown":"Threads are one way to achieve concurrency.

I reload the page in browser, Header is rendered with &quot;loggedinUser&quot; correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400014/vue-component-is-not-getting-re-rendered-refreshed","title":"Vue component is not getting

This is why even [`deactivate`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/6b93efdd857d2acb54b61dfbf63c24540d3ccb63/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart#L872) has a [`mustCallSuper` annotation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/meta/mustCallSuper-constant.html).  \r\n*Additionally*, some `mixin`s expect that you call the super methods of those lifecycle methods at a particular point in the function.\r\n\r\nThis means that you should follow the documentation and call `super.dispose` **at the end** of your `dispose` method because `mixin`s on `State` in the framework expect that this is the case.  \r\nFor example: [`TickerProviderStateMixin`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TickerProviderStateMixin-mixin.html) and [`SingleTickerProviderStateMixin`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/SingleTickerProviderStateMixin-mixin.html) [assert](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/fb33b7a1b86aacae45145e40f7946a4de62e3e9a/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/ticker_provider.dart#L183) `super.dispose` at the end:\r\n\r\n&gt; All Tickers must [..] be disposed before calling super.dispose().\r\n\r\nAnother example: [`AutomaticKeepAliveMixin`](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/fb33b7a1b86aacae45145e40f7946a4de62e3e9a/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/automatic_keep_alive.dart#L344) executes logic in `initState` and `dispose`.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\n[Start your `initState` with `super.initState`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/initState.html) and [end your `dispose` with `super.dispose`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/dispose.html) if you want to be on the easy and safe side adding `mixin`s to your `State`.  \r\nFurthermore, follow the documentation for other lifecycle methods (any method you overwrite in `State`) because the framework will expect that you call the super methods as described in the documentation.\r\n\r\nThus, the following is what you should do:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nvoid initState() {\r\n  super.initState();    \r\n  //DO OTHER STUFF\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not *really* matter for `State`, which I will explain in the following and even for mixins, it only matters for assertions judging from what I could find - so it would not affect your production app.\r\n\r\n## It does not matter for `State`\r\n\r\nI think that the previous two answers from [Pablo Barrera](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938462/) and [CopsOnRoad](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6618622) are *misleading* because the truth of the matter is that it really does not matter and you do not need to look far.\r\n\r\nThe only actions that [`super.initState`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/initState.html) and [`super.dispose`](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/State/dispose.html) take in the `State` class itself are **assertions** and since `assert`-statements are only evaluated in *debug mode*, it does not matter at all once build your app, i.e. in production mode.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn the following, I will guide you through what `super.initState` and `super.dispose` do in `State`, which is all the code that will be executed when you have no additional mixins.\r\n\r\n### `initState`\r\n\r\nLet us look exactly what code is executed in `super.initState` first ([source](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/fb33b7a1b86aacae45145e40f7946a4de62e3e9a/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart#L1017)):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@protected\r\n@mustCallSuper\r\nvoid initState() {\r\n  assert(_debugLifecycleState == _StateLifecycle.created);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there is only a lifecycle assertion and the purpose of it is to ensure that your widget works correctly. So as long as you call `super.initState` **somewhere** in your own `initState`, you will see an `AssertionError` if your widget is not working as intended. It does not matter if you took some prior action because the `assert` is only meant to report that something in your code is wrong anyway and you will see that even if you call `super.initState` at the very end of your method.\r\n\r\n### `dispose`\r\n\r\nThe `dispose` method is analogous ([source](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/fb33b7a1b86aacae45145e40f7946a4de62e3e9a/packages/flutter/lib/src/widgets/framework.dart#L1209)):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n@protected\r\n@mustCallSuper\r\nvoid dispose() {\r\n  assert(_debugLifecycleState == _StateLifecycle.ready);\r\n  assert(() {\r\n    _debugLifecycleState = _StateLifecycle.defunct;\r\n    return true;\r\n  }());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it also only contains assertions that handle **debug** lifecycle checking. The second `assert` here is a nice trick because it ensures that the `_debugLifecycleState` is only changed in debug mode (as `assert`-statements are only executed in debug mode).  \r\nThis means that as long as you call `super.dispose` *somewhere* in your own method, you will not lose any value without mixins adding additional functionality.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400001/should-i-call-super-initstate-at-the-end-or-at-the-beginning/58400324#58400324","title":"Should I call super.initState at the end or at the beginning?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17518,"user_id":6509751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/260caa996ae8ac9fcee35487aa8d7c81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"creativecreatorormaybenot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6509751/creativecreatorormaybenot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571165687,"post_id":58400989,"comment_id":103147212,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400001/should-i-call-super-initstate-at-the-end-or-at-the-beginning/58400989#comment103147212_58400989"},{"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":11144200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2331954870177756/picture?type=large","display_name":"Anirudh Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11144200/anirudh-sharma"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17518,"user_id":6509751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/260caa996ae8ac9fcee35487aa8d7c81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"creativecreatorormaybenot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6509751/creativecreatorormaybenot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571166229,"post_id":58400989,"comment_id":103147435,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400001/should-i-call-super-initstate-at-the-end-or-at-the-beginning/58400989#comment103147435_58400989"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97,"user_id":11144200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2331954870177756/picture?type=large","display_name":"Anirudh Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11144200/anirudh-sharma"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571165538,"creation_date":1571165538,"answer_id":58400989,"question_id":58400001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400989","body_markdown":"initState called up by default whenever a new stateful widget is added into a widget tree. \r\nNow the super.initState performs the default implementation of the  base class of your widget.If you call anything before super.initState that depends on the base class then this might cause problem.\r\nThat&#39;s why it&#39;s recommended that you call initState in this fashion:\r\n```\r\n@override\r\nvoid initState() {\r\n  super.initState();\r\n  // DO STUFF\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58400001/should-i-call-super-initstate-at-the-end-or-at-the-beginning/58400989#58400989","title":"Should I call super.initState at the end or at the beginning?"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":9554350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Nl3j9NPOgVc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADg/6kAoB_gUaws/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"K Vij","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9554350/k-vij"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17518,"user_id":6509751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/260caa996ae8ac9fcee35487aa8d7c81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"creativecreatorormaybenot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6509751/creativecreatorormaybenot"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58400324,"answer_count":4,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571167544,"creation_date":1571161220,"last_edit_date":1571165287,"question_id":58400001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58400001","body_markdown":"I am confused as to where to call the `super.initSate()` in flutter?

Because of its examples, documentation, and support, I decided to go with Dropbox API 2.0.\r\nI am using the code from [Dropbox API-2.0 Examples-SimpleTest][1] to implement an asynchronous file uploader. The file simply uploads a pseudo-randomly named *.json file to an app folder /nullJSON. The uploaded files are simply *.json files that contain a json string.\r\nBelow is my code. Since Unity uses .NetCore, I cannot use WebRequestHandler when setting up the http Client:\r\n\r\n**API Calls:**\r\n```c#\r\n    //For Game\r\n    using System.Collections;\r\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n    using UnityEngine;\r\n    using UnityEngine.UI;\r\n    using System.Xml;\r\n    using UnityEngine.Networking;\r\n    using System.IO;\r\n    using UnityEngine.EventSystems;\r\n    using System.Net;\r\n    using UnityEngine.Networking.NetworkSystem;\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Net.Sockets;\r\n    //For Dropbox API\r\n    using System.Threading;\r\n    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;\r\n    using System.Net.Http;\r\n    using System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n    using System.Linq;\r\n    using Newtonsoft.Json;\r\n    using Dropbox.Api;\r\n    using Dropbox.Api.Common;\r\n    using Dropbox.Api.Files;\r\n    using Dropbox.Api.Team;\r\n```\r\n**Client Initializer (responsible for setting up the HTTP/Dropbox Client):**\r\n```c#\r\n    public void dBoxSetup()\r\n    {\r\n        //Only run if the dropbox client doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n        if (dBoxClient == null)\r\n        {\r\n            //Connect to Dropbox\r\n            DropboxCertHelper.InitializeCertPinning();\r\n            httpClient = new HttpClient()\r\n            {\r\n                Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20)\r\n            };\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                var config = new DropboxClientConfig(&quot;nullificationApp&quot;)\r\n                {\r\n                    HttpClient = httpClient\r\n                };\r\n                dBoxClient = new DropboxClient(accessToken, config);\r\n            }\r\n            catch (HttpException e)\r\n            {\r\n                StartCoroutine(ShowMessage(&quot;Application Error: Exception reported from RPC layer&quot;, 5));\r\n                Debug.Log(&quot;Exception reported from RPC layer&quot;);\r\n                Debug.Log(&quot;    Status code: &quot; + e.StatusCode);\r\n                Debug.Log(&quot;    Message    : &quot; + e.Message);\r\n                if (e.RequestUri != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    Debug.Log(&quot;    Request uri: &quot; + e.RequestUri);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n ```\r\n\r\nThis code seems to work as the API analytics show that it is successfully connecting, and I am not getting any exception errors on its setup.\r\n**Create A New JSON File:**\r\n```c#\r\npublic async void dBoxCreate()\r\n    {\r\n        //This fucntion creates a new JSON file.\r\n        if (!IPaddr.text.Equals(&quot;&quot;))\r\n        {\r\n            //Naming convention should have already been checked.\r\n            string defenderInfo = pathJSON();\r\n            //Create Page to Upload\r\n            await ChunkUpload(dBoxClient, jsonPath, fileName + &quot;.json&quot;, defenderInfo);\r\n            Debug.Log(&quot;Creating file &quot; + fileName);\r\n            StartCoroutine(ShowMessage(&quot;Creating file&quot; + fileName, 5));\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            Debug.Log(&quot;Please provide an Opponent IP Address&quot;);\r\n            StartCoroutine(ShowMessage(&quot;Please provide an Opponent IP Address&quot;, 5));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nThis code also work fine with no errors.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n**The actual Uploader (Where the Error Actually Occurs):**\r\n```c#\r\n    /// &lt;summary&gt;\r\n    /// Uploads a big file in chunk.

not sure of the validation you are doing, but can it be moved to the front-end? Typically validation in the front-end is more for user experience. (Eg. Incorrect Formats, fields left blank, incorrect data type in field). If that&#39;s the case I&#39;d move it to the front-end, if not you can leave it in the back-end.\r\n\r\nYou could validate the fields in the form using AJAX when they leave focus. This can guarantee that when they submit the form, the fields in the form will always be correct. I find a healthy mix of front-end and server side validation works best and not have everything in the back-end. \r\n\r\nThe crude example below sends off an ajax request to the controller to validate the input field when the `onblur` method fires. It will set the border to either green or red if it passed validation and display a message if there is one to display. Just make sure your model matches up with what you would be sending in your request:\r\n\r\nJS:\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n        function validate() {\r\n            var input = { input: $(&#39;#one&#39;).val() };\r\n    \r\n            $.ajax({\r\n                url: &#39;ValidateTextBox/&#39;,\r\n                type: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n                contentType: &#39;application/json&#39;,\r\n                data: JSON.stringify(input),\r\n                success: function (data) {\r\n                    if (JSON.parse(data.Result)) {\r\n                        $(&#39;#one&#39;).css(&#39;border&#39;, &#39;5px solid green&#39;);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        $(&#39;#one&#39;).css(&#39;border&#39;, &#39;5px solid red&#39;);\r\n                    }\r\n                    $(&#39;#result&#39;).text(data.Message);\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n        }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;input id=&quot;one&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; onblur=&quot;validate()&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;label id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\r\n\r\nController.cs\r\n\r\n    [HttpPost]\r\n    public ActionResult ValidateTextBox(Dummy data)\r\n    {\r\n        int result = 0;\r\n    \r\n        if (!int.TryParse(data.input, out result)) {\r\n            return Json(new { Result = false, Message = &quot;Please enter in numbers&quot; });\r\n        }\r\n        return Json(new { Result = true, Message = &quot;Success&quot; });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nModel.cs\r\n\r\n    public class Dummy\r\n    {\r\n        public string input { get; set; }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399967/how-to-handle-validation-errors-server-side-when-a-file-is-uploaded/58400300#58400300","title":"How to handle validation error(s) Server Side when a file is uploaded"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21142,"user_id":3215948,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRU0y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Racil Hilan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3215948/racil-hilan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4742,"user_id":4830196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcatD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan Wilson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4830196/ryan-wilson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571171350,"post_id":58400860,"comment_id":103149390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399967/how-to-handle-validation-errors-server-side-when-a-file-is-uploaded/58400860#comment103149390_58400860"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21142,"user_id":3215948,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRU0y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Racil Hilan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3215948/racil-hilan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21142,"user_id":3215948,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRU0y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Racil Hilan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3215948/racil-hilan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571171271,"last_edit_date":1571171271,"creation_date":1571164947,"answer_id":58400860,"question_id":58399967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400860","body_markdown":"As you guessed, for security reasons, no major browsers gives you access to the actual path to the file selected by the user. Your server code will not receive the real path, and even JavaScript is not allowed access to it. Instead, the browser generates a fake path, and the only real value in it is the file name.\r\n\r\nFor that reason, the only way to keep the file in your current design (i.e. standard form) after the form is submitted is the way you did it as you described it in your question. Obviously, this is not a good way especially if the file is too big, then each round trip to the server will take a long time.\r\n\r\nTo solve it differently, you&#39;ll need to change the design. You need to make the browser retain the real path value. The only way to do this is by not submitting the form. So you need to submit the form values without submitting the form. The only way to do this I can think of is by submitting the form using Ajax. This means that the result of the server-side validation will have to come back as an Ajax response (usually JSON, but can be serialized in other ways if you like) and then JavaScript will take that response and display the errors on the form as required. In this way, the file is still re-submitted every time to the server, but at least the server doesn&#39;t need to send it back to the client like the way described in the question. That saves half of the bandwidth, but will require more programming. It is still not recommended if the file can be big. In that case, it is probably better to let the user reselect the file again rather than having to wait a long time for the file to be uploaded again.\r\n\r\nTo add the Ajax helper to .Net Core, you can simply download the JavaScript file from the [project GitHub](https://github.com/aspnet/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive) and link to it in the header of your HTML. However, I prefer to only link to it on the pages where I need it, because most pages don&#39;t need it. What I do is, first create a partial view for it:\r\n\r\n    &lt;environment names=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;script src=&quot;~/lib/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/environment&gt;\r\n    &lt;environment exclude=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;script src=&quot;~/lib/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/environment&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can use CDN if you like. I cannot find a CDN other than cdn.jsdelivr.net, and I cannot find a good fallback test so I left `asp-fallback-test` empty:\r\n\r\n    &lt;environment names=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;script src=&quot;~/lib/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/environment&gt;\r\n    &lt;environment exclude=&quot;Development&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive@3.2.6/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.min.js&quot;\r\n            asp-fallback-src=&quot;~/lib/jquery-ajax-unobtrusive/dist/jquery.unobtrusive-ajax.min.js&quot;\r\n            asp-fallback-test=&quot;&quot;\r\n            crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;\r\n            integrity=&quot;sha256-PAC000yuHt78nszJ2RO0OiDMu/uLzPLRlYTk8J3AO10=&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/environment&gt;\r\n\r\nEither way, call this file anything you like, let&#39;s say `_AjaxScriptsPartial.cshtml`. Now in the view where you need it, add it like this:\r\n\r\n    @section Scripts {\r\n        @{ await Html.RenderPartialAsync(&quot;_AjaxScriptsPartial&quot;); }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is a good explanation on how to use it: [Using Unobtrusive Ajax In Razor Pages](https://www.mikesdotnetting.com/article/326/using-unobtrusive-ajax-in-razor-pages).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can keep your current design, but instead of serializing the file and send it back to the browser, save it on the server and send the URL to the browser. Now, in the JavaScript, replace the file input field with a simple message like &quot;File uploaded successfully&quot; or any other way to indicate to the user that the file doesn&#39;t need to be re-selected. When the form is re-submitted and all server validation succeed, get the physical file on the server. Your code will have to know whether to upload the file or get it from the server (by checking if the file input field has a file). It also needs to know where to get it on the server. This way will work fine for all file sizes, because the files is only uploaded once, but it requires some work.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399967/how-to-handle-validation-errors-server-side-when-a-file-is-uploaded/58400860#58400860","title":"How to handle validation error(s) Server Side when a file is uploaded"}],"owner":{"reputation":4742,"user_id":4830196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xcatD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ryan Wilson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4830196/ryan-wilson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21142,"user_id":3215948,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mRU0y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Racil Hilan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3215948/racil-hilan"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":72,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58400860,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571171271,"creation_date":1571161090,"last_edit_date":1571169134,"question_id":58399967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399967","body_markdown":"  I have a form which is validated server side and if the form has invalid items, the model is returned to the View and JavaScript then highlights fields which are invalid. This is a multi-part form which contains an input type file for a file upload. I am using Visual Studio 2017, ASP.Net Core 2.1 and ASP.Net MVC design pattern.\r\n\r\n  **Problem**: User submits the form and has a file attached but the form is invalid due to one or many input fields.

This Will go on until the device reconnects physically and is able to create the serial Port an receive Data on it.\r\n\r\nIs there a more elegant way to permanently check for a specific device using the HardwareString?\r\n\r\nThank you very much.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399964/how-to-permanently-check-if-serial-device-connects-disconnects-in-uwp-c","title":"How to permanently check If serial device connects/disconnects in UWP C#?"},{"tags":["javascript","html","json","database","web"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22892,"user_id":1291492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f914cd02166793195d9d950503f8f739?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ControlAltDel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1291492/controlaltdel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571161189,"post_id":58399963,"comment_id":103145283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399963/what-are-some-easy-lightweight-ways-to-write-and-save-small-quantities-of-data#comment103145283_58399963"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2034,"user_id":5784924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LC3Oq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5784924/nicolas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571161196,"creation_date":1571161196,"answer_id":58399993,"question_id":58399963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58399993","body_markdown":"You could save it into the [Html5 localstorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage).\r\n\r\n`window.localStorage.setItem(&#39;counter&#39;, yourCounterVariable)`.\r\n\r\nAnd then retreive it using \r\n\r\n`window.localStorage.getItem(&#39;counter&#39;)`\r\n\r\nThis information will be saved localy by the browser and will be available until the user clear it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399963/what-are-some-easy-lightweight-ways-to-write-and-save-small-quantities-of-data/58399993#58399993","title":"What are some easy, lightweight ways to write and save small quantities of data for a dirt simple web app?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10496206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ERkzafAF92g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABQw/LifZngLH1zc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gabe Santos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10496206/gabe-santos"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571161440,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571161196,"creation_date":1571161071,"question_id":58399963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399963","body_markdown":"I literally just need to save/write one number.

If they have an apple, they can store its name (&quot;Apple&quot;), value ($2.99), and quantity (1) to localStorage.\r\n\r\nThere are three input fields:\r\n\r\nName, Value, and Quantity.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;text&quot; name = &quot;name&quot; placeholder = {props.name ? props.name : &quot;Name&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n                    \r\n&lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;number&quot; name = &quot;value&quot; placeholder = {props.value ? props.value : &quot;Value ($)&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n                    \r\n&lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;number&quot; min = &quot;0&quot; name = &quot;quantity&quot; placeholder = {props.quantity !== null ? props.quantity : &quot;Quantity&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n```\r\nThe Name input always records and sends to state, but the others *inconsistently* come up ```null``` or ```NaN```. The Quantity Input does this the most frequently (for some reason).\r\n\r\nNow, I have absolutely no idea how this could possibly happen or where I&#39;d even begin debugging. I tried changing ```handleInputChange``` to be more specific, but the error still *inconsistently* persists.\r\n\r\nThis is my handleInputChange method: \r\n```\r\nhandleInputChange = (event) =&gt; {\r\n        this.setState({\r\n            [event.target.name] : event.target.value\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPretty straight forward. It used to have ```const {name, value} = event.target```, but that&#39;s what I changed. It had no effect.\r\n\r\nThe state values that are supposed to be recorded begin like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nname: null,\r\nvalue: null,\r\nquantity: null,\r\nid: null,\r\n```\r\nThe component &quot;Modal&quot; is directly inside the main return block on ```Home.js```, where the state and most of the functions are.\r\n\r\nMy main problem, the thing that confuses me so much, is the fact that I made the ```handleInputChange``` function do ```console.log()``` for both the ```event.name``` and ```event.value```, and *that* is where the issue came from. The ```console.log()``` inconsistently *doesn&#39;t log the results*, meaning that ```onChange``` isn&#39;t running in those instances. Ignoring all modal functions, an ```onChange``` event should *always* run the function on the change.\r\n\r\nSo, since ```&lt;input type = &quot;text&quot;&gt;``` worked, but not ```&lt;input type = &quot;number&quot;&gt;```, I thought to just change the input type to &quot;text&quot; for Value and Quantity. That didn&#39;t fix it. \r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity and scope, here is the series of ternary methods I use to render the different types of content that should appear in the modal (this includes the inputs listed above):\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n props.modalType !== &quot;pocketbook&quot; ?\r\n            \r\n      &lt;form id = &quot;modal-content&quot;&gt; \r\n        {props.modalType === &quot;tax&quot; /// For triggering the Tax Input Modal\r\n          ? &lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;number&quot; name = &quot;tax&quot; placeholder = {props.tax ? \r\n               `${parseFloat(props.tax).toFixed(2)}%` : &quot;Sales Tax (%)&quot;}&gt;\r\n            &lt;/input&gt;\r\n          : // If it&#39;s not for taxes, it&#39;s for items\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;input  type = &quot;text&quot; name = &quot;name&quot; placeholder = {props.name ? props.name : &quot;Name&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n            &lt;br/&gt;\r\n            &lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;text&quot; name = &quot;value&quot; placeholder = {props.value ? props.value : &quot;Value ($)&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n            &lt;br/&gt;\r\n    \r\n            &lt;div id = &quot;qty-editors&quot;&gt; // This allows the user to set the quantity value via input or by pressing + or - buttons\r\n                &lt;input onChange = {props.handleInputChange} type = &quot;text&quot; name = &quot;quantity&quot; placeholder = {props.quantity !== null ? props.quantity : &quot;Quantity&quot;}&gt;&lt;/input&gt;\r\n                        \r\n                &lt;div className = &quot;div-button&quot; id = &quot;addition&quot; onClick = {() =&gt; \r\n                {props.quantityEdit(&quot;add&quot;)}}&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p className = &quot;centered-XY&quot;&gt;+&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        \r\n                &lt;div className = &quot;div-button&quot; id = &quot;subtraction&quot; onClick = {() =&gt;{props.quantityEdit(&quot;sub&quot;)}}&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p className = &quot;centered-XY&quot;&gt;-&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            \r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            }\r\n      &lt;/form&gt;\r\n            \r\n      :\r\n\r\n       &lt;div id = &quot;pocketbook&quot;&gt; // This is simply for &quot;pocket&quot; creation, has nothing to do with the inputs.\r\n         {\r\n           allPockets.map(item =&gt; {\r\n            return (\r\n                            \r\n            &lt;Pocket \r\n             name = {item}\r\n             subtitle = {item}\r\n             func = {&quot;pocketbook&quot;}\r\n             pocketMethod = {props.pocketMethod}\r\n            /&gt;\r\n                            \r\n            );\r\n           })\r\n         }\r\n       &lt;/div&gt;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt can be argued that I&#39;m relying too much on ternary operators. Unless that&#39;s causing the problem, however, don&#39;t address it in your answer.\r\n\r\nAs much information as I&#39;ve given, in reality, the problem lies directly in the ```onChange``` functionality, because the ```console.log()``` doesn&#39;t run (again, inconsistently) when the input field is changed. I&#39;ve tried avoiding using tab to cycle through the inputs, the issue persists. I&#39;ve tried avoiding pressing the shift key inside the number inputs, the issue persists. I&#39;ve tried setting the ```onChange``` method on the parent element(s), the issue persists. If anybody can tell me what exactly is going on and how I can fix it, it would absolutely save this project.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399944/react-handleinputchange-function-inconsistently-not-working-with-some-inputs","title":"React &quot;handleInputChange&quot; function inconsistently not working with some inputs"},{"tags":["python-3.x","jupyter-notebook","ipython"],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":624048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R15ai.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"robot11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/624048/robot11"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571160984,"creation_date":1571160984,"question_id":58399943,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399943","body_markdown":"It seems I can&#39;t use Jupyter notebook at all.

doesn&#180;t responds and it&#180;s font size doesn&#180;t get changed (`doneBtnToDecorate`):\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language:

array size first\r\n    int index;\r\n    for (index = 0; index &lt; 4; index++)\r\n        {\r\n        ptr[index]=index;\r\n        printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, ptr[index]);\r\n        }\r\n    return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can also use `malloc()` if you want to allocate it on the heap, but make sure to `free()` it, to free the memory, or there will be a memory leak.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    int main(void)\r\n    {\r\n    int *ptr = malloc(4*sizeof(int));\r\n    int index;\r\n    for (index = 0; index &lt; 4; index++)\r\n        {\r\n        ptr[index]=index;\r\n        printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, ptr[index]);\r\n        }\r\n    free(ptr);\r\n    return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis should solve your problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399936/simple-question-on-pointers-and-how-to-initialize-an-array-in-c/58400893#58400893","title":"Simple question on pointers and how to

After a lot of reading I found I could use the [ChainedTransactionManager][1] to coordinate the DataSource and JMS resources:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\npublic class TransactionConfiguration {\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public ChainedTransactionManager transactionManager(JpaTransactionManager jpaTm, JmsTransactionManager jmsTm) {\r\n        return new ChainedTransactionManager(jmsTm, jpaTm);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public JpaTransactionManager jpaTransactionManager(EntityManagerFactory emf) {\r\n        return new JpaTransactionManager(emf);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public JmsTransactionManager jmsTransactionManager(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {\r\n        return new JmsTransactionManager(connectionFactory);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nQueue listener:\r\n```\r\n    @Transactional(transactionManager = &quot;transactionManager&quot;)\r\n    @JmsListener(...)\r\n    public void process(@Payload String message) {\r\n        //Write to db\r\n        //Send to output queue\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    START MESSAGING TX\r\n    START DB TX\r\n    READ MESSAGE\r\n    WRITE DB\r\n    SEND MESSAGE\r\n    COMMIT DB TX\r\n    COMMIT MESSAGING TX\r\n\r\n- If the db commit fails the message will be reprocesed again\r\n- If the db commit succeeds but the messaging commit fails the message will be reprocessed. This it not a problem since I can guarantee the idempotency of the db write operation\r\n\r\nNow my doubt is, let&#39;s suppose I hadn&#39;t configured the `ChainedTransactionManager` and the listener were like this (no `@Transactional`):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @JmsListener(...)\r\n    public void process(@Payload String message) {\r\n        //Write to db\r\n        //Send to output queue\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoesn&#39;t this behave the same as the other example despite not coordinating the commits? (I&#39;ve verified that on SQL exceptions the message is redelivered)\r\n\r\n```\r\n    RECEIVE MESSAGE\r\n    WRITE DB + COMMIT\r\n    SEND MESSAGE + COMMIT\r\n```\r\n\r\n- If the DB commit failed the message would be reprocessed\r\n- If it succeeded and the send message operation failed it would be reprocessed again.\r\n\r\nSo is the `ChainedTransactionManager` really necessary in this case?\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**: Debugging the Spring Boot autoconfiguration (`JmsAnnotationDrivenConfiguration`)...\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Bean\r\n\t@ConditionalOnMissingBean(name = &quot;jmsListenerContainerFactory&quot;)\r\n\tpublic DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory jmsListenerContainerFactory(\r\n\t\t\tDefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer configurer, ConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {\r\n\t\tDefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory factory = new DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactory();\r\n\t\tconfigurer.configure(factory, connectionFactory);\r\n\t\treturn factory;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n... the `DefaultJmsListenerContainerFactoryConfigurer` is configuring the factory with `factory.setSessionTransacted(true);` because there is no `JtaTransactionManager` defined:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if (this.transactionManager != null) {\r\n\t\t\tfactory.setTransactionManager(this.transactionManager);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\telse {\r\n\t\t\tfactory.setSessionTransacted(true);\r\n\t\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith setSessionTransacted(true), according to the [Spring doc][2] I would get the message rollback and redelivery behaviour I need on DB (or any) exceptions:\r\n\r\n&gt; Local resource transactions can simply be activated through the\r\n&gt; sessionTransacted flag on the listener container definition. Each\r\n&gt; message listener invocation will then operate within an active JMS\r\n&gt; transaction, with message reception rolled back in case of listener\r\n&gt; execution failure. Sending a response message (via\r\n&gt; SessionAwareMessageListener) will be part of the same local\r\n&gt; transaction, but any other resource operations (such as database\r\n&gt; access) will operate independently. This usually requires duplicate\r\n&gt; message detection in the listener implementation, covering the case\r\n&gt; where database processing has committed but message processing failed\r\n&gt; to commit.\r\n\r\nThat explains I&#39;m getting the behaviour I expect without needing to configure the `ChainedTransactionManager`. \r\n\r\nAfter all this, could you tell me if it makes sense (it adds some guarantee I&#39;m missing) to use the `ChainedTransactionManager` in this case?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

If I run pytest like this:\r\n` $ pytest ./tests/ ` I get: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ pytest ./tests/\r\n============================= test session starts ==============================\r\nplatform linux -- Python 3.7.4, pytest-5.2.1, py-1.8.0, pluggy-0.13.0\r\nrootdir: /home/whlt/repos/tj-image-resizer/tests, inifile: pytest.ini\r\ncollected 5 items                                                              \r\n\r\ntests/test_file1.py .

I&#39;ve tried `$ pytest ./tests/ -W ignore::DeprecationWarning:urllib3.*:` and I&#39;ve tried `$ pytest ./tests/ -W ignore::DeprecationWarning:botocore.*:`. Both of these result in the same output as the first example with no filtering.\r\n\r\nHow can I filter out DeprecationWarnings from the version of `urllib3` packaged with the vendored version of `requests` included with `botocore` (which gets called when I run commands with the `boto3` library)?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399870/pytest-suppress-deprecationwarning-from-specific-3rd-party-modules","title":"pytest - Suppress DeprecationWarning from specific 3rd party modules"},{"tags":["python","pandas","pivot-table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571161135,"post_id":58399869,"comment_id":103145252,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399869/pandas-pivot-and-group-by-dont-match#comment103145252_58399869"},{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":5112032,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/783e405a36a8ee5012167acffe82f578?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"eljusticiero67","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5112032/eljusticiero67"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571161221,"post_id":58399869,"comment_id":103145294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399869/pandas-pivot-and-group-by-dont-match#comment103145294_58399869"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23929,"user_id":4238408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RWkmO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Quang Hoang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4238408/quang-hoang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571161291,"creation_date":1571161291,"answer_id":58400010,"question_id":58399869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58400010","body_markdown":"`pivot_table` drops `nan` by default.

That gets in the way because you want to be able to bind to properties of the real datacontext, which is the row object, `ImportColumn`. \r\n\r\nWe can fix this by using the same RelativeSource you&#39;re using for the DataContext inside your multibinding, which leaves us free to bind ComboBox.SelectedItem to `FileColumnHeader` on the `ImportColumn` for that row. \r\n\r\n```XAML\r\n&lt;DataTemplate&gt;\r\n    &lt;ComboBox \r\n        VerticalAlignment=&quot;Center&quot; \r\n        SelectedItem=&quot;{Binding FileColumnHeader}&quot;\r\n        SelectionChanged=&quot;ComboBox_SelectionChanged&quot;\r\n        &gt;\r\n        &lt;ComboBox.ItemsSource&gt;\r\n            &lt;MultiBinding Converter=&quot;{StaticResource listFilterConverter}&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Binding \r\n                    Path=&quot;DataContext.ListOfWorksheetColumns.UnselectedWorksheetColumns&quot;\r\n                    RelativeSource=&quot;{RelativeSource AncestorType={x:Type ListView}}&quot;\r\n                    /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Binding RelativeSource=&quot;{RelativeSource Self}&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/MultiBinding&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ComboBox.ItemsSource&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ComboBox&gt;\r\n&lt;/DataTemplate&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve learned in comments that the SelectionChanged handler is being used for other stuff that can and arguably should be done in MVVM, but it gets a bit involved. \r\n\r\nFor that to work right, `ImportColumn.FileColumnHeader` needs to properly raise PropertyChanged when its value changes. Since you&#39;ve got `ImportColumn` inheriting from something called `BaseViewModel`, I&#39;m going to guess that you may have omitted that detail for the sake of brevity. \r\n\r\nA bit off topic: I&#39;m confident that your `listFilterConverter` should be taking something other than a `ComboBox` as its second parameter. Whatever properties it&#39;s getting from the ComboBox, you should be just binding those properties instead. A converter is much harder to reuse if the consumer needs to wrap its parameters in a `ComboBox`. But that&#39;s not of the essence right now. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58399860/access-comboboxes-inside-a-listview-via-c/58400696#58400696","title":"Access ComboBoxes inside a ListView via C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":8820567,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5a7f0a93952c46753e0a2cd0bfcbd96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Quasimodo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8820567/quasimodo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":8820567,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5a7f0a93952c46753e0a2cd0bfcbd96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Quasimodo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8820567/quasimodo"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58400696,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571165866,"creation_date":1571160591,"last_edit_date":1571164667,"question_id":58399860,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58399860","body_markdown":"I have a ListView which contains 2 columns.
