will describe the simplest use case in which I fail to use numpy in a way that seems quite intuitive to me, and would require some extra level of abstraction:\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n\r\n 1. Assume an object `MyObj` which has some fields, namely `x, y, z`. Thee fields are numpy ndarrays:\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    x_shape = (1,2,3)\r\n    y_shape = (5,6,7,8,9)\r\n\r\n    def MyObj(object):\r\n        def init(self):\r\n            self.x = np.zeros(x_shape)\r\n            self.y = np.zeros(y_shape)\r\n\r\n 2. I would like to manage these objects in a container that allows me to add objects one by one, efficiently, \r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\n    my_obj1 = MyObj()\r\n    my_obj2 = MyObj()\r\n    my_obj3 = MyObj()\r\n    my_obj4 = MyObj()\r\n    objs = MyContainer()  # this is what the question is about\r\n    objs.append(my_obj1)\r\n    objs.append(my_obj2)\r\n    objs.append(my_obj3)\r\n    objs.append(my_obj4)\r\n\r\n 3. The container should support **efficient** access to its fields, as if it were a numpy ndarray whose shape is the same as the desired field, with an extra first dimension, with the same size as the objects in the container:\r\n\r\nexample: \r\n\r\n    assert objs.x.shape == (len(objs),) + x_shape  # (4,1,2,3)\r\n    assert objs.y.shape == (len(objs),) + y_shape  # (4,5,6,7,8,9)\r\n    access_to_field = objs.x[:, 0,0,0] # access to the first element in X of all objects in the container. **This has to be efficient, just like a numpy view**\r\n\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nI could not find a native way to do this in numpy, and I want to know the best practice for this standard use case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265767/how-to-create-a-container-that-supports-addition-of-objects-and-numpy-slicing","title":"How to create a container that supports addition of objects and numpy slicing?"},{"tags":["arrays","swift","uicollectionview","youtube-api"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":7233049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-YQ3oXUZI0RY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABE/Qh5wDN9ZApA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Team chang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7233049/team-chang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570437058,"post_id":58265820,"comment_id":102899444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265766/collectionview-displays-last-data-only/58265820#comment102899444_58265820"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":4854891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WEK2n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakir Hossain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4854891/jakir-hossain"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":4854891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WEK2n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakir Hossain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4854891/jakir-hossain"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570437593,"last_edit_date":1570437593,"creation_date":1570436532,"answer_id":58265820,"question_id":58265766,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265820","body_markdown":"Your `CollectionView` displays only the last data because you are not creating `new instance` for each video data.

Surprisingly it works more than what I had imagined, but without further ado here&#39;s the code:\r\n\r\n```bash \r\n## Remove dependencies for twistlock.\r\nRUN rm -r /opt/jboss/wildfly/modules/system/layers/base/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/jackson-databind/\r\nRUN rm -r /opt/jboss/wildfly/modules/system/layers/base/org/apache/commons/beanutils/\r\nRUN rm -r /opt/jboss/wildfly/modules/system/layers/base/org/picketlink/\r\nRUN rm -r /opt/jboss/wildfly/bin/client\r\n```\r\n\r\nI decided to manually try to remove the dependencies associated with WildFly itself, **but** without surprise, this resulted in the applications failing to successfully deploy. \r\n\r\n## Additional\r\nEven if I specify the dependencies in the pom file like so, it still doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;!-- ...

does not do what you think it does.\r\n\r\nThe actual password validation is done before the User object is saved, by calling the `django.contrib.auth.password_validation.validate_password` method. \r\nThis method calls every validator in your settings `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS`, and raises an exception when any of these validators fail. This can be any kind of validation, like whether the new password is complex enough, or whether it is different enough from the username.\r\n\r\nAccording to [the docs][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; By default, validators are used in the forms to reset or change\r\n&gt; passwords and in the createsuperuser and changepassword management\r\n&gt; commands. \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Validators aren’t applied at the model level, for example in\r\n&gt; User.objects.create_user() and create_superuser(), because we assume\r\n&gt; that developers, not users, interact with Django at that level and\r\n&gt; also because model validation doesn’t automatically run as part of\r\n&gt; creating models.\r\n\r\nSo, the User save model doesn&#39;t do any validation on the User&#39;s password, the Forms and commands do. If you manually set the password in the code somewhere, make sure you do that validation yourself.\r\n\r\n**So what does `password_validation.password_changed(self._password, self)` do?**\r\n\r\nSimply said, it informs all active validators that the user has changed their password, along with the actual *raw* new password. Why is this necessary? Suppose I write a validator that checks whether a user tries to change their password to a password they have used before. This validator will need to know which passwords the user has had in the past, so I&#39;ll need to save a list of (hashed) original passwords per user.\r\n\r\n`password_changed` is basically a way for Django to say to all password validators: *&quot;Hey, take note, the user&#39;s password has been changed to this value, so if you need to keep track of for some reason, do it now, because after this, I&#39;ll destroy the unhashed version of this password&quot;*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/auth/passwords/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265752/django-user-model-what-is-the-purpose-of-password-changes-in-the-save-method/58267450#58267450","title":"Django User model: what is the purpose of password changes in the save() method"}],"owner":{"reputation":1841,"user_id":2897115,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2624b65b6cff84369e57413b62c75e46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Santhosh Yedidi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2897115/santhosh-yedidi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1841,"user_id":2897115,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2624b65b6cff84369e57413b62c75e46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Santhosh Yedidi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2897115/santhosh-yedidi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570485761,"creation_date":1570436226,"last_edit_date":1570485761,"question_id":58265752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265752","body_markdown":"Sometimes i want to set the password programmatically.

For example (for integers), `1, 2` scaled by a factor of 2 (using &quot;a)&quot; above) would be `1, 1.5, 2` but `1.5` isn&#39;t an integer and is &quot;equally close&quot; to both `1` and `2`. There are 5 possibilities here (round to negative infinity, round to zero, round away from zero, round to even, round to positive infinity).\r\n\r\nNow...\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume there are 4 integer data types (8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit) and 3 floating point data types (32-bit, 64-bit and 80-bit) and therefore there are &quot;`7*3*5= 105`&quot; possible permutations of data type, scaling method and rounding.\r\n\r\n**Would you want to add 105 different functions to the C standard library to cover all of these permutations?**\r\n\r\nIf you do; then what about scaling 2D arrays, and scaling &quot;array of structure/bitfield&quot;, and ...? Surely these things are all more frequently desired.\r\n\r\n**How many millions of rarely needed functions would need to be added to the standard library before scaling 2D arrays of primitive numbers becomes the &quot;next least infrequently desired&quot; feature in a library that currently doesn&#39;t even support extremely basic stuff (like `beep(frequency)`)?**\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265745/scale-and-interpolate-an-array/58268889#58268889","title":"Scale and interpolate an array"}],"owner":{"reputation":2392,"user_id":1138160,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/76ba5bd954a4f842d93c7eaba0b39227?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elmi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1138160/elmi"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1570454777,"accepted_answer_id":58268711,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570448551,"creation_date":1570436187,"question_id":58265745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265745","body_markdown":"I have a simple 1D array with some numbers (which do NOT represent anything that have to do with an image), and four elements containing e.g.\r\n\r\n    1 5 9 13\r\n\r\nNow I want to scale this array by a factor of 3 to a size of 12 elements and interpolate the contained numbers in the new array elements linearly.

[MSDN documentation][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; The system also sends WM_PARENTNOTIFY messages when it creates and\r\n&gt; destroys a window, but not for controls created from a dialog box\r\n&gt; template. The system prevents these messages by specifying the\r\n&gt; WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY style when creating the controls. An application\r\n&gt; cannot override this default behavior unless it creates its own\r\n&gt; controls for the dialog box.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to this, all buttons that are created from dialog template will not receive `WM_PARENTNOTIFY`. (your code in `DerivedDialog::OnInitDialog()` has no affect).\r\n\r\nThe `WM_PARENTNOTIFY` works if you dynamically create a button (or child control).\r\n\r\nSample (add to your existing code):\r\n\r\n1. Add `CButton m_sampleButton` member in the dialog header.\r\n2.

I am lost, please help!\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KN3HC.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ImMbo.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265709/sumifs-with-dates-returning-0-for-values","title":"SUMIFS with dates returning 0 for values"},{"tags":["javascript","html","d3.js"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":12171106,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ea2e646cf47800d7eb0e4309ba7013e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"malemir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12171106/malemir"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570437693,"creation_date":1570437693,"answer_id":58266082,"question_id":58265706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58266082","body_markdown":"You can check out [this example][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/bradparks/d3-Simple-Line-Graph-with-Points-and-Tooltip-Hoverstate/blob/master/index.html\r\n\r\nnote the : .style(&quot;visibility&quot;, &quot;hidden&quot;) in tooltip options.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265706/how-to-hide-and-show-points-on-a-line-graph/58266082#58266082","title":"How to hide and show points on a line graph"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":9611462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1808042309246039/picture?type=large","display_name":"Chew Kah Meng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9611462/chew-kah-meng"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570492596,"post_id":58266467,"comment_id":102923148,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265706/how-to-hide-and-show-points-on-a-line-graph/58266467#comment102923148_58266467"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"last_editor":{"reputation":76227,"user_id":5768908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PjGM7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gerardo Furtado","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5768908/gerardo-furtado"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570455791,"last_edit_date":1570455791,"creation_date":1570439222,"answer_id":58266467,"question_id":58265706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58266467","body_markdown":"The problem is the way you track the clicked state. Specifically, this variable for the line...\r\n\r\n    //Determine if current line is visible\r\n    var active = blueLine.active ? false : true;\r\n\r\n... and this variable for the circles:\r\n\r\n    // Determine if dots are visible\r\n    var active = blackDot.active ? false : true;\r\n\r\nThe line (actually, a `&lt;path&gt;` element) has an id named `blueLine`. Because of that, the element itself is a property of the `window` object, that is, a global variable. For instance, have a look at this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    console.log(window.foo)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThus, `blueLine.active` works, even if you never declared `blueLine` anywhere in the code.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the line has an id, your circle&#39;s don&#39;t (be it `blackDot` or not). Also, the line in question is **just one** and therefore can have an id, but you have **several circles** and, because of that, an id cannot be used (more on that below).\r\n\r\nSo, the solution is tracking the clicked state another way. For instance, using a property of the datum:\r\n\r\n    .on(&quot;click&quot;, function(d){\r\n\t    // Determine if dots are visible\r\n\t\tvar active   = d.active ? false : true;\r\n\r\nHere is the code with that change:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var data = [{\r\n        x: 0,\r\n        y: 0\r\n      }, {\r\n        x: 5,\r\n        y: 30\r\n      }, {\r\n        x: 10,\r\n        y: 40\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        x: 15,\r\n        y: 60\r\n      }, {\r\n        x: 20,\r\n        y: 70\r\n      }, {\r\n        x: 25,\r\n        y: 100\r\n      }\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    const margin = {\r\n      left: 20,\r\n      right: 20,\r\n      top: 20,\r\n      bottom: 80\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    const svg = d3.select(&#39;svg&#39;);\r\n    svg.selectAll(&quot;*&quot;).remove();\r\n\r\n    const width = 200 - margin.left - margin.right;\r\n    const height = 200 - margin.top - margin.bottom;\r\n\r\n    const g = svg.append(&#39;g&#39;).attr(&#39;transform&#39;, `translate(${margin.left},${margin.top})`);\r\n\r\n\r\n    var x = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n      .domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) {\r\n        return d.x;\r\n      })])\r\n      .range([0, width])\r\n      .nice();\r\n\r\n    var y = d3.scaleLinear()\r\n      .domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) {\r\n        return d.y;\r\n      })])\r\n      .range([0, height])\r\n      .nice();\r\n\r\n    const xAxis = d3.axisTop()\r\n      .scale(x)\r\n      .ticks(5)\r\n      .tickPadding(5)\r\n      .tickSize(-height)\r\n\r\n    const yAxis = d3.axisLeft()\r\n      .scale(y)\r\n      .ticks(5)\r\n      .tickPadding(5)\r\n      .tickSize(-width);\r\n\r\n    svg.append(&quot;g&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;x axis&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;transform&quot;, `translate(20,${height-margin.top-60})`)\r\n      .call(xAxis);\r\n\r\n    svg.append(&quot;g&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;y axis&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;transform&quot;, &quot;translate(20,20)&quot;)\r\n      .call(yAxis);\r\n\r\n    var lineFunction = d3.line()\r\n      .x(function(d) {\r\n        return x(d.x);\r\n      })\r\n      .y(function(d) {\r\n        return y(d.y);\r\n      })\r\n      .curve(d3.curveLinear);\r\n\r\n    //defining and plotting the lines\r\n    var path = g.append(&quot;path&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;path1&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;id&quot;, &quot;blueLine&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;d&quot;, lineFunction(data))\r\n      .attr(&quot;stroke&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;stroke-width&quot;, 2)\r\n      .attr(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;none&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;clip-path&quot;, &quot;url(#clip)&quot;);\r\n\r\n    // plot a circle at each data point\r\n    g.selectAll(&quot;.dot&quot;)\r\n      .data(data)\r\n      .enter().append(&quot;circle&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;cx&quot;, function(d) {\r\n        return x(d.x);\r\n      })\r\n      .attr(&quot;cy&quot;, function(d) {\r\n        return y(d.y);\r\n      })\r\n      .attr(&quot;r&quot;, 3)\r\n      .attr(&quot;class&quot;, &quot;blackDot&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;clip-path&quot;, &quot;url(#clip)&quot;);\r\n\r\n    //************* Legend ***************\r\n    var legend = svg.selectAll(&quot;.legend&quot;)\r\n      .data(data)\r\n      .enter().append(&quot;g&quot;)\r\n\r\n    legend.append(&quot;rect&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;x&quot;, width + 65)\r\n      .attr(&quot;y&quot;, 50)\r\n      .attr(&quot;width&quot;, 18)\r\n      .attr(&quot;height&quot;, 4)\r\n      .style(&quot;fill&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;)\r\n\r\n    legend.append(&quot;text&quot;)\r\n      .attr(&quot;x&quot;, width + 60)\r\n      .attr(&quot;y&quot;, 50)\r\n      .attr(&quot;dy&quot;, &quot;.35em&quot;)\r\n      .style(&quot;text-anchor&quot;, &quot;end&quot;)\r\n      .on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {\r\n        // Determine if current line is visible\r\n        var active = blueLine.active ?

It doesn&#39;t have to be a single record, or even a single type of message. So, you can collect a bunch of different messages from a single data source, and process them all individually.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not the node above the &#39;final/bottom&#39; node per se, since an envelope can contain a bunch of other types (in case you want to do some validation on the receiving part).\r\n\r\nThe example from your [first link][1] allows pretty much any XML below the body, since it&#39;s using an `Any` element. That means I could just add a `Warning` record to their example:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Envelope xmlns=&quot;http://BasicXMLEnvelope&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;Error&gt;\r\n        &lt;ID&gt;102&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n        &lt;Type&gt;0&lt;/Type&gt;\r\n        &lt;Priority&gt;High&lt;/Priority&gt;\r\n        &lt;Description&gt;Sprocket query fails.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n        &lt;ErrorDateTime&gt;1999-05-31T13:20:00.000-05:00&lt;/ErrorDateTime&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Error&gt;\r\n      &lt;Error&gt;\r\n        &lt;ID&gt;16502&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n        &lt;Type&gt;2&lt;/Type&gt;\r\n        &lt;Priority&gt;Low&lt;/Priority&gt;\r\n        &lt;Description&gt;Time threshold exceeded.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n        &lt;ErrorDateTime&gt;1999-05-31T13:20:00.000-05:00&lt;/ErrorDateTime&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Error&gt;\r\n      &lt;Warning&gt;\r\n        &lt;ID&gt;333&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n        &lt;Description&gt;Just a warning.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n        &lt;WarningDateTime&gt;2019-10-07T15:15:00.000+02:00&lt;/WarningDateTime&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Warning&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Envelope&gt;\r\n\r\nUsing the described debatching method, this single incoming message will result in three messages in the message box;\r\n\r\n    &lt;Error&gt;\r\n      &lt;ID&gt;102&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n      &lt;Type&gt;0&lt;/Type&gt;\r\n      &lt;Priority&gt;High&lt;/Priority&gt;\r\n      &lt;Description&gt;Sprocket query fails.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n      &lt;ErrorDateTime&gt;1999-05-31T13:20:00.000-05:00&lt;/ErrorDateTime&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Error&gt;\r\n\r\n... and ...\r\n\r\n    &lt;Error&gt;\r\n      &lt;ID&gt;16502&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n      &lt;Type&gt;2&lt;/Type&gt;\r\n      &lt;Priority&gt;Low&lt;/Priority&gt;\r\n      &lt;Description&gt;Time threshold exceeded.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n      &lt;ErrorDateTime&gt;1999-05-31T13:20:00.000-05:00&lt;/ErrorDateTime&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Error&gt;\r\n\r\n... and ...\r\n\r\n    &lt;Warning&gt;\r\n      &lt;ID&gt;333&lt;/ID&gt;\r\n      &lt;Description&gt;Just a warning.&lt;/Description&gt;\r\n      &lt;WarningDateTime&gt;2019-10-07T15:15:00.000+02:00&lt;/WarningDateTime&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Warning&gt;\r\n\r\n... to which you can then subscribe to.\r\n\r\nThis is - in my opinion - particularly useful if you have a single source of messages where each message is meant for another destination (e.g. different customers), or where the destination requires that each message is sent individually (e.g. a target invoice schema that allows only one invoice per file).\r\n\r\nThe alternative to this method would be to just select one record at a time from the source.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/core/walkthrough-using-xml-envelopes-basic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265674/explanation-of-biztalk-envelope-schemas-and-debatching/58270393#58270393","title":"Explanation of BizTalk envelope schemas and debatching"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":11862538,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9963c8f8f7c5dc1b51bbd374e96adeea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mrc85","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11862538/mrc85"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58270393,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570454270,"creation_date":1570435861,"question_id":58265674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265674","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently self-studying BizTalk as part of a new role, and have picked up the core concepts of developing Orchestrations and configuring pipelines.\r\nRecently I&#39;ve been trying to get my head around debatching resultsets containing multiple records into separate messages using Envelope Schemas, and finally got it working last week by using the below tutorials;\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/biztalk/core/walkthrough-using-xml-envelopes-basic\r\nhttps://blog.tallan.com/2014/12/23/typed-polling-with-wcf-adapters/\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking for if possible is for someone kind enough to give me an understanding of the mechanics involved so that I can confirm my understanding of the process to incorporate fully into my solutions.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is:\r\nThe Receive Pipeline is using the XML Disassembler to break apart my message on the basis that I&#39;ve flagged the receiving schema as an Envelope.\r\n\r\n**This is where my question kicks in.** On the schema, I&#39;m setting the parent node&#39;s Body XPath to that of the node ABOVE the final node containing the result elements.

setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n\r\n    observeLiveData();\r\n\r\n    initViewsAndListeners();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void initViewsAndListeners() {\r\n    tinderStackLayout = findViewById(R.id.activity_main_tinder_stack_layout);\r\n    mDeleteButton = findViewById(R.id.activity_main_delete_button);\r\n    mPassButton = findViewById(R.id.activity_main_pass_button);\r\n    mApproveButton = findViewById(R.id.activity_main_approve_button);\r\n    mDeleteButton.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n    mApproveButton.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n    mPassButton.setOnClickListener(this);\r\n    listener = new OnCardSwipedListener() {\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void send(Object object) {\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      @Override\r\n      public void onNext(Integer integer) {\r\n\r\n\r\n        if (integer == 1) {\r\n          addCards(1);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n\r\nprivate void observeLiveData() {\r\n    userViewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this).get(UserViewModel.class);\r\n    userViewModel.getAllUsers().observe(this, users -&gt; {\r\n      //update a new list of users\r\n      usersList = (ArrayList) users;\r\n      addCards(-1);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void addCards(int stackSizeToAdd) {\r\n    TinderCardView tinderCardView;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = index; index &lt; i + (STACK_SIZE + stackSizeToAdd); index++) {\r\n      if (index &gt;= usersList.size()) {\r\n        index = 0;\r\n        i = 0;\r\n        addCards(-1);\r\n      }\r\n      tinderCardView = new TinderCardView(this, listener);\r\n      tinderCardView.bind(usersList.get(index));\r\n      tinderStackLayout.addCard(tinderCardView);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI am for sure doing something wrong with my loop but I can&#39;t figure out what. \r\n\r\n\r\nmy variables at start - \r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate static final int STACK_SIZE = 2;\r\n\r\n  private TinderStackLayout tinderStackLayout;\r\n  private OnCardSwipedListener listener;\r\n  private UserViewModel userViewModel;\r\n  private ArrayList&lt;User&gt; usersList;\r\n  private int index = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my issue actually is getting one more card than needed. The first card when starting the application is being duplicated, so this is why I though I am not getting the right stack size. but when swipping and deleting some cards, there is no more duplication. So my issue is understanding why the first card is being duplicated.

At the same time for a regular input field, it works correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265615/selenium-sendkeys-for-contenteditable-in-chrome-works-not-correct","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Selenium sendKeys for contenteditable in Chrome works not correct"},{"tags":["javascript","vue.js","pagination","vuex"],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":11847253,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3dedbecfdad69bfd7fe19566513d86d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iamPanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11847253/iampanda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":84,"user_id":11847253,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3dedbecfdad69bfd7fe19566513d86d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"iamPanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11847253/iampanda"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570690409,"creation_date":1570435544,"last_edit_date":1570690409,"question_id":58265612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265612","body_markdown":"I am paginating the data.

For eg. if you say:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Route path=&quot;/animals/:animal&quot; component={AnimalPage} /&gt;\r\n```\r\nwill render the `AnimalPage` when URLs like `/animals/cat` or `/animals/dog` is taken.

And than it will be a single thread program\r\n2) You need, that your index will be correct in each iteration(thought you still can run all iterations parallel).\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s see example for my problem:\r\n \r\n     int new_index = 0;\r\n\r\n     #pragma omp parallel for\r\n     for (int i = 0; i&lt;10; i++)\r\n     {\r\n        &lt;mutex lock&gt;          \r\n        new_index++  \r\n        &lt;mutex unlock&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n        //do_something_1\r\n        //do_something_2\r\n        //do_something_3\r\n        my_array[new_index] = 5; //correct\r\n        my_array[i] = 5; //not correct\r\n     }\r\n\r\nSo, there will be still 10 iterations, but now it should be a correct index each time for my_array.\r\nThe problem is : thread_1 increments  new_index(new_index = 1), complete do_something_1, and then switched to  thread_2.\r\nThread_2 completes it&#39;s loop completely(new_index = 2), but now , when OS switch back to thread_1, there is no correct new_index(new_index = 1) and my_array stays unchanged. \r\nSo, I thought if it possible to tall to OS, don&#39;t switch threads in a middle of iteration.

It shows the loss function `J` as a function of the parameter `W`. Here it is a simplified representation with `W` being the only parameter. So, for a convex loss function, the curve looks as shown.\r\n\r\nNote that the learning rate is positive. On the left side, the gradient (slope of the line tangent to the curve at that point) is negative, so the product of the learning rate and gradient is negative. Thus, subtracting the product from `W` will actually increase `W` (since 2 negatives make a positive). In this case, this is good because loss decreases.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand (on the right side), the gradient is positive, so product of the learning rate and gradient is positive, so the product of the learning rate and gradient is positive. Thus, subtracting the product from `W` reduces `W`. In this case also, this is good because the loss decreases.\r\n\r\nWe can extend this same thing for more number of parameters (the graph shown will be higher dimensional and won&#39;t be easy to visualize, which is why we had taken a single parameter `W` initially) and for other loss functions (even non-convex ones, though it won&#39;t always converge to the global minima, but definitely to the nearest local minima).\r\n\r\nNote : This explanation can be found in Andrew Ng&#39;s courses of deeplearning.ai, but I couldn&#39;t find a direct link, so I wrote this answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbAvD.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265580/what-does-a-sub-lra-grad-actually-do/58266479#58266479","title":"What does a.sub_(lr*a.grad) actually do?"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11525116,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-uYQdmaRg8Pg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfjLZetPuGKaD-XIjdNtKT0D2RzUg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luis Anaya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11525116/luis-anaya"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58266479,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570439240,"creation_date":1570435426,"question_id":58265580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265580","body_markdown":"I am doing the course of fast-ai, SGD and I can not understand.....\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subtracts the coefficients by (learning rate * gradient)...\r\n\r\nBut why is it necessary to subtract?\r\n\r\nhere is the code:\r\n\r\n    def update(): \r\n      y_hat = x@a  \r\n      loss = mse(y_hat, y) \r\n      if t % 10 == 0: print (loss)\r\n      loss.backward() \r\n      with torch.no_grad(): \r\n        a.sub_(lr * a.grad) \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265580/what-does-a-sub-lra-grad-actually-do","title":"What does a.sub_(lr*a.grad) actually do?"},{"tags":["html","countdowntimer","downloadfile"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570455013,"post_id":58265817,"comment_id":102908167,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265579/html-countdown-time-is-not-stopping-after-specified-time/58265817#comment102908167_58265817"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570437239,"last_edit_date":1570437239,"creation_date":1570436521,"answer_id":58265817,"question_id":58265579,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265817","body_markdown":"Quite a few issues.\r\n\r\nStudy the simplified code below\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the element with id=linkout is supposed be\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function getQueryVariable(variable) {\r\n      var query = window.location.search.substring(1);\r\n      var vars = query.split(&quot;&amp;&quot;);\r\n      for (var i = 0;
