Both directly\r\n&gt; expose the underlying native platform response object interface. When\r\n&gt; using them, you should also import the typings for the underlying\r\n&gt; library (e.g., @types/express) to take full advantage. Note that when\r\n&gt; you inject either @Res() or @Response() in a method handler, you put\r\n&gt; Nest into Library-specific mode for that handler, and you become\r\n&gt; responsible for managing the response. When doing so, you must issue\r\n&gt; some kind of response by making a call on the response object (e.g.,\r\n&gt; res.json(...) or res.send(...)), or the HTTP server will hang.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing#testing-utilities\r\n  [2]: https://docs.nestjs.com/controllers#appendix-library-specific-approach\r\n  [3]: https://docs.nestjs.com/fundamentals/testing\r\n\r\nHope it helps, don&#39;t hesitate to comment, or share your solution if it helped finding another one ! :)\r\n\r\nWelcome to StackOverflow platform by the way !","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135998/how-to-use-value-which-returned-from-controller-testing-controllers-on-nestjs/58193272#58193272","title":"How to use value which returned from controller?

want to create a dataframe full of UUID values. Obviously, each UUID in the dataframe should be unique. Furthermore, my end use requires that each UUID value be enclosed in braces (e.g.: {e681b500-dafb-11e9-9912-1319dd65aab1}).\r\n\r\nI am using the package [uuid](http://www.rforge.net/uuid/). Unfortunately, I&#39;ve found that in some scenarios, the command [UUIDgenerate()](https://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/uuid/UUIDgenerate.html) does not generate unique UUID values.\r\n\r\nThe code below initializes a data frame of desired size, then uses a for loop to call UUIDgenerate() for each index in the dataframe. I&#39;ve called the command within the paste() command to enclose each UUID value in braces.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(&#39;uuid&#39;)\r\n\r\nNoOfRows = 5\r\nNoOfCols = 150\r\ndf_UUIDs = data.frame(matrix(ncol=NoOfCols,nrow=NoOfRows))\r\n\r\nfor (i in c(1:NoOfRows)){\r\n    for (j in c(1:NoOfCols)){\r\n        df_UUIDs[i,j] = paste(&quot;{&quot;,UUIDgenerate(FALSE),&quot;}&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n```\r\nThe code above does successfully generate a dataframe full of UUIDs enclosed in braces, but the values are not all unique! \r\n\r\nTo show this, the code below counts the number of entries in the dataframe, then counts the number unique values in the dataframe. The test reveals that the code above generates only between 2-38 unique UUIDs when there should be 750.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(&#39;dplyr&#39;)\r\ndim(as.data.frame(unlist(df_UUIDs)))[1]\r\ndim(distinct(as.data.frame(unlist(df_UUIDs))))[1]\r\n```\r\nHere are some additional clues:\r\n\r\n1. The number of unique values generated is different every time I run the code\r\n2. The error does not occur when argument use.time=TRUE\r\n3.

If one of the zones fails, the total size of cluster becomes between two and eight nodes.\r\n\r\nBut there are limitations.\r\n\r\n&gt;Occasionally, cluster autoscaler cannot scale down completely and an extra node exists after scaling down. This can occur when required system Pods are scheduled onto different nodes, because there is no trigger for any of those Pods to be moved to a different node. See [I have a couple of nodes with low utilization, but they are not scaled down. Why?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#i-have-a-couple-of-nodes-with-low-utilization-but-they-are-not-scaled-down-why). To work around this limitation, you can configure a [Pod disruption budget](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/disruptions/).\r\n\r\nHere are the reasons why the nodes might not be scaled down:\r\n&gt;-   the node group already has the minimum size,\r\n&gt;    \r\n&gt;-   node has the scale-down disabled annotation (see  [How can I prevent Cluster Autoscaler from scaling down a particular node?](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/blob/master/cluster-autoscaler/FAQ.md#how-can-i-prevent-cluster-autoscaler-from-scaling-down-a-particular-node))\r\n&gt;    \r\n&gt;-   node was unneeded for less than 10 minutes (configurable by  `--scale-down-unneeded-time`  flag),\r\n&gt;    \r\n&gt;-   there was a scale-up in the last 10 min (configurable by  `--scale-down-delay-after-add`  flag),\r\n&gt;    \r\n&gt;-   there was a failed scale-down for this group in the last 3 minutes (configurable by  `--scale-down-delay-after-failure`  flag),\r\n &gt;  \r\n&gt;-   there was a failed attempt to remove this particular node, in which case Cluster Autoscaler will wait for extra 5 minutes before considering it for removal again,\r\n&gt;    \r\n&gt;-   using large custom value for  `--scale-down-delay-after-delete`  or  `--scan-interval`, which delays CA action.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135974/is-there-a-way-to-resize-a-gke-cluster-to-0-nodes-after-a-certain-amount-of-idle/58136327#58136327","title":"Is there a way to resize a GKE cluster to 0 nodes after a certain amount of idle time?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1830,"user_id":9231144,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63da0be227b72dd9dfdda45972952fde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patrick W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9231144/patrick-w"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569638176,"creation_date":1569638176,"answer_id":58142927,"question_id":58135974,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58142927","body_markdown":"A GKE cluster can never scale down to 0 because of the system pods running in the cluster.

And that works fine for regular exceptions. But how do you deal with this situation if nested exceptions occur?\r\n\r\nConsider this example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef test():\r\n\ttry:\r\n\t\ta = 0\r\n\t\tb = 5 / a\r\n\texcept Exception as ee1:\r\n\t\tassert False\r\n\r\ntest()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example prints two exceptions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;./test4d.py&quot;, line 12, in test\r\n    b = 5 / a\r\nZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n\r\nDuring handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:\r\n\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;./test4d.py&quot;, line 18, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    test()\r\n  File &quot;./test4d.py&quot;, line 14, in test\r\n    assert False\r\nAssertionError\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo information about both exceptions is known to the interpreter. I therefore like to retrieve these two pieces of information from Python: The stack trace of the assert statement (used as an example here to cause an exception) and the stack trace of the division by zero exception (used as an example here to cause an exception). *How can I do that?*\r\n\r\nAnd the second part of the question: How can I do that in a structured way? The module `traceback` can be used to get more information about an existing exception. But I do not want to print the exception, I want to store it. Therefore I&#39;d like to get the stack trace as a tuple of instances of some class where each instance represents the data within each stack frame. How can I do *that*?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135953/how-to-get-the-stack-trace-of-a-nested-exeption-in-python","title":"How to get the stack trace of a nested exeption in python?"},{"tags":["git","tfs","report","pull-request"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42937,"user_id":781754,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ee1072483e3ab3c7302820d04935328?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Mann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/781754/daniel-mann"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569598114,"post_id":58135952,"comment_id":102661486,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135952/tfs-git-pull-request-report#comment102661486_58135952"},{"owner":{"reputation":2460,"user_id":26447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbaeb252415d6123214e1b98c17117ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Evgeny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/26447/evgeny"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":42937,"user_id":781754,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ee1072483e3ab3c7302820d04935328?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Mann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/781754/daniel-mann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569690129,"post_id":58135952,"comment_id":102681178,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135952/tfs-git-pull-request-report#comment102681178_58135952"},{"owner":{"reputation":34064,"user_id":5391065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b615692abd82961458da80dd640f3300?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PatrickLu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5391065/patricklu-msft"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570010387,"post_id":58135952,"comment_id":102776618,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135952/tfs-git-pull-request-report#comment102776618_58135952"},{"owner":{"reputation":2460,"user_id":26447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbaeb252415d6123214e1b98c17117ac?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Evgeny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/26447/evgeny"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570098804,"post_id":58135952,"comment_id":102810623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135952/tfs-git-pull-request-report#comment102810623_58135952"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34064,"user_id":5391065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b615692abd82961458da80dd640f3300?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PatrickLu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5391065/patricklu-msft"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569827098,"creation_date":1569827098,"answer_id":58162972,"question_id":58135952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58162972","body_markdown":"It&#39;s not hard if you want to obtain a report of pending pull requests, or even completed pull requests, you can use widget available here in your dashboards. \r\n\r\nSuch as this 3rd-party extension-- [Pull Request Dashboard][1] \r\n\r\nHowever, if you want a custom report, you can use [REST API][2] and create your own report.

While I understand that generally the type of the std::function parameter can&#39;t be deduced as it is a non-deduced context.\r\n\r\nIt is not a non-deduced context. Quite the contrary. Because deduction for the parameter of `std::function` is attempted, but the argument is *not* a `std::function`, deduction fails. The deduction of template arguments from function arguments must agree for all function arguments. If it fails for one, it fails entirely.\r\n\r\n&gt; **[temp.deduct.type]**\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [2][2] In some cases, the deduction is done using a single set of\r\n&gt; types P and A, in other cases, there will be a set of corresponding\r\n&gt; types P and A. Type deduction is done independently for each P/A pair,\r\n&gt; and the deduced template argument values are then combined. If type\r\n&gt; deduction cannot be done for any P/A pair, or if for any pair the\r\n&gt; deduction leads to more than one possible set of deduced values, or if\r\n&gt; different pairs yield different deduced values, or if any template\r\n&gt; argument remains neither deduced nor explicitly specified, template\r\n&gt; argument deduction fails.\r\n\r\nMaking the type of the second function parameter into a non-deduced context is actually how one can overcome the error.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n    \r\n    template&lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    struct type_identity {\r\n        using type = T;\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename&gt; \r\n    struct S { };\r\n    \r\n    void g(S&lt;int&gt; ) {}\r\n    \r\n    template &lt;typename T&gt;\r\n    void f(T, typename type_identity&lt;std::function&lt;void(S&lt;T&gt;)&gt;&gt;::type) {}\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n        f(0, g);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n`T` is deduced successfully from the first function argument, and there is nothing left to deduce.

In this case, 3 threads try to write to the same address of the global memory (`y[0]`) at the same time. To avoid data race, you should 1) use `atomicAdd` or 2) use `cupy.ReductionKernel` for reduction.\r\n\r\nActually, the `kernel_conv` also has a data race. The first thread running `y[2] += x[2]` may conflict with the second thread running `y[2] += x[0]`. Since the first one was slightly lagged in the actual execution, the result was not affected, but this is a timing problem and not guaranteed in general*. To correct it, you can use `atomicAdd` here again, or you can also change the way to run the computation by multiple threads (e.g. launching 5 threads each of which computes a distinct element of `y`).\r\n\r\n\\* Indeed, in the above example of `kernel_conv`, I guess the correctness IS guaranteed when all the threads are running in the same warp, i.e., the number of threads is not larger than 32. It is because all the threads in the same warp are running synchronously until divergence by control flows. If the number of threads is set to a larger value, a data race may happen at a warp boundary.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135930/problem-with-summing-entries-using-the-elementwise-kernel-in-cupy/58142425#58142425","title":"Problem with summing entries using the elementwise kernel in cupy"}],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":2777802,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8cd98f5dc766d3e18a7612a967a44bf3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DerJFK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2777802/derjfk"},"last_editor":{"reputation":264257,"user_id":68587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7d9fd158e03cbde94f7e0b33b78222af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Kugelman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/68587/john-kugelman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569629773,"creation_date":1569592295,"last_edit_date":1569592562,"question_id":58135930,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58135930","body_markdown":"In the first code example (kernel_conv), I programmed a simple convolution and it worked with the expected result [1,1,2,1,1]. \r\n\r\nThen I used the elementwise kernel to sum all entries of a vector.

I was running Apache 16.04 and hadn&#39;t noticed the requirement to update to 18.04.\r\nFor other people having similar problems, here are a few issues I encountered:\r\n\r\n - [This article][1], which someone mentioned in the comments, was useful. ALTHOUGH, this step didn&#39;t work: &quot;sudo a2dismod php7.2&quot;. The error was that php7.2 isn&#39;t a module. Ignoring this step caused no problems.\r\n - The do-release-upgrade step of upgrading from 16.04 to 18.04 kept aborting. [This answer][2] on Linode helped.\r\n - Finally, all my Wordpress sites broke temporarily because the new installation didn&#39;t come with mysql as default. Using apt-get install php7.2-mysql fixed that.\r\n\r\nHopefully that&#39;s useful to someone, and you experience less stress than I did!\r\n\r\n**ORIGINAL QUESTION:**\r\n\r\n\r\nI have used    \r\n```\r\na2enmod http2\r\n```\r\nTo enable http2 on my server. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever my sites are still loading on http1.1. After reading several StackOverflow answers I think I&#39;ve narrowed this down to mpm_prefork not being compatible with http2.\r\n\r\nWhen I disable mpm_prefork and enable mpm_event, then attempt to restart my server, I get the following issue:\r\n\r\n```\r\nJob for apache2.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See &quot;systemctl status apache2.service&quot; and &quot;journalctl -xe&quot; for details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nApache2cl configtest showed the following and suggested that I recompile PHP:\r\n\r\n```\r\nApache is running a threaded MPM, but your PHP Module is not compiled to be threadsafe. You need to recompile PHP.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter reading this I disabled mpm_event and reenabled mpm_prefork which has allowed me to restart Apache, but the underlying issue remains.\r\n\r\nHow can I properly configure PHP to allow http2 to work as intended?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://helgeklein.com/blog/2018/11/enabling-http-2-in-apache-on-ubuntu-18-04/\r\n  [2]: https://www.linode.com/community/questions/17813/errors-when-upgrading-from-1604-to-1804","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135926/http2-enabled-but-site-is-served-by-http1","title":"HTTP2 enabled but site is served by HTTP1"},{"tags":["java","html","regex","jsoup"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14775,"user_id":2191572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWbVr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MonkeyZeus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2191572/monkeyzeus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597707,"post_id":58135924,"comment_id":102661307,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input#comment102661307_58135924"},{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6231856,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208939094464352/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oleg Shankovskyi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6231856/oleg-shankovskyi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14775,"user_id":2191572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWbVr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MonkeyZeus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2191572/monkeyzeus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569599573,"post_id":58135924,"comment_id":102662166,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input#comment102662166_58135924"},{"owner":{"reputation":14775,"user_id":2191572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TWbVr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MonkeyZeus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2191572/monkeyzeus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569607040,"post_id":58135924,"comment_id":102665283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input#comment102665283_58135924"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6231856,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208939094464352/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oleg Shankovskyi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6231856/oleg-shankovskyi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569600065,"post_id":58137418,"comment_id":102662415,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input/58137418#comment102662415_58137418"},{"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11861129"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51,"user_id":6231856,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208939094464352/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oleg Shankovskyi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6231856/oleg-shankovskyi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569600467,"post_id":58137418,"comment_id":102662592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input/58137418#comment102662592_58137418"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user11861129"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569597876,"creation_date":1569597876,"answer_id":58137418,"question_id":58135924,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58137418","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n    import Torello.HTML.*;\r\n    import Torello.HTML.NodeSearch.TagNodeFind;\r\n    import Torello.HTML.Tools.ReplaceNodes;\r\n    import Torello.Java.FileRW;\r\n    \r\n    import java.util.*;\r\n    import java.io.*;\r\n    \r\n    public class Scrape\r\n    {\r\n        static final String html =\r\n            &quot;&lt;p&gt;Some text here with already existing tags and it&amp;#39;s escaped symbols.\\n&quot;

+\r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;    More text here:&lt;br/&gt;\\\\r\\\\n---&lt;br/&gt;\\\\r\\\\n&quot; +\r\n\t\t\t\t&quot;    &lt;img src=\\&quot;/attachments/a0d4789a-1575-4b70-b57f-9e8fe21df46b\\&quot; sha256=\\&quot;2957635fcf46eb54d99f4f335794bd75a89d2ebc1663f5d1708a2fc662ee065c\\&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;

I can do it easily with Jsoup like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\t\tDocument doc = Jsoup.parse(html);\r\n\t\tElements elementsByAttribute = doc.select(&quot;img[src]&quot;);\r\n\t\telementsByAttribute.forEach(x -&gt; x.attr(&quot;src&quot;, &quot;/usr/myfolder/&quot; + x.attr(&quot;sha256&quot;) + &quot;.zip&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut there is a problem. Incoming text already has some formatting, html tags, escaping etc that need to be preserved. But Jsoup removes tags / adds tags / unescapes / escapes and does some other modifications to the original input.\r\n\r\nFor example, `System.out.println(doc);` or `System.out.println(doc.html());` gives me following:\r\n```\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;\r\n &lt;body&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Some text here with already existing tags and it&#39;s escaped symbols. More text here:&lt;br&gt;\\r\\n---&lt;br&gt;\\r\\n &lt;img src=&quot;/usr/myfolder/2957635fcf46eb54d99f4f335794bd75a89d2ebc1663f5d1708a2fc662ee065c.zip&quot; sha256=&quot;2957635fcf46eb54d99f4f335794bd75a89d2ebc1663f5d1708a2fc662ee065c&quot;&gt; It was img tag with attr to replace above&lt;/p&gt;\\r\\n\\r\\n\r\n  &lt;p&gt;More text here and here.&lt;br&gt;\\r\\n---&lt;/p&gt;\r\n &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy `src` attribute is replaced, but a lot more html-tags are added, `it&amp;#39;s` is escaped to `it&#39;s`.\r\n\r\nIf I use `System.out.println(doc.text());` i receive following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSome text here with already existing tags and it&#39;s escaped symbols. More text here: \\r\\n--- \\r\\n It was img tag with attr to replace above\\r\\n\\r\\n More text here and here. \\r\\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy tags are removed here, `it&amp;#39;s` is escaped to `it&#39;s` again.\r\n\r\nI tried some other Jsoup features but didn&#39;t find how to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nQuesion: is there any way to replace only some attributes with Jsoup without changing other tags? Maybe there is some othere library for that purpose? Or my only way is regex?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135924/replace-some-html-attributes-with-jsoup-without-changing-rest-of-input","title":"Replace some HTML attributes with Jsoup without changing rest of input"},{"tags":["android","bitmap","android-storage"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2708,"user_id":2548988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a64c4d3033369ce36d4252ddbfa6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"esentsov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2548988/esentsov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569596874,"post_id":58135922,"comment_id":102660912,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135922/cant-save-image-to-gallery#comment102660912_58135922"},{"owner":{"reputation":4893,"user_id":8274756,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207212471548575/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tamir Abutbul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8274756/tamir-abutbul"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2708,"user_id":2548988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a64c4d3033369ce36d4252ddbfa6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"esentsov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2548988/esentsov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597093,"post_id":58135922,"comment_id":102661011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135922/cant-save-image-to-gallery#comment102661011_58135922"},{"owner":{"reputation":2708,"user_id":2548988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a64c4d3033369ce36d4252ddbfa6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"esentsov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2548988/esentsov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569597239,"post_id":58135922,"comment_id":102661077,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135922/cant-save-image-to-gallery#comment102661077_58135922"},{"owner":{"reputation":4893,"user_id":8274756,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207212471548575/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tamir Abutbul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8274756/tamir-abutbul"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2708,"user_id":2548988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a64c4d3033369ce36d4252ddbfa6983?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"esentsov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2548988/esentsov"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569599280,"post_id":58135922,"comment_id":102662048,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135922/cant-save-image-to-gallery#comment102662048_58135922"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4893,"user_id":8274756,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10207212471548575/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tamir Abutbul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8274756/tamir-abutbul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569917708,"post_id":58137490,"comment_id":102741386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135922/cant-save-image-to-gallery/58137490#comment102741386_58137490"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":63,"user_id":6568980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-WwYrAUa-FSY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAwQ/sRt2r7QI8Us/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pasan Bhanu Guruge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6568980/pasan-bhanu-guruge"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569598183,"creation_date":1569598183,"answer_id":58137490,"question_id":58135922,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58137490","body_markdown":"I tried this but not worked for me too.

Then the value would be &#39;02019&#39; so that when the strings are concatenated you will end up with your desired &#39;Z_0201905&#39;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135880/why-is-there-a-space-when-concatenating-varchars-in-this-sql-2008-query/58136015#58136015","title":"Why is there a space when concatenating varchars in this SQL 2008 query?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":3100124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7224b3fe80d1f95b76eafead073b56c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"uberbloke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3100124/uberbloke"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569593007,"creation_date":1569593007,"answer_id":58136134,"question_id":58135880,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58136134","body_markdown":"Short answer\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @Mon char(2),\r\n            @Year char(5)\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve updated your script and changed the output so you can see what is going on.\r\n\r\n    DECLARE @Mon char(3),\r\n            @Year char(6)\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = &#39;5&#39;\r\n    SET @Year = &#39;2019&#39;\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Mon as varchar(2))), 2)\r\n    SET @Year = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Year AS varchar(4))), 5)\r\n    --SELECT @Year\r\n    --SELECT @Mon\r\n    --SELECT @Year+@Mon\r\n    SELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + @Year + @Mon ;\r\n    SELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + &#39;--&gt;&#39; + @Year + &#39;&lt;-- --&gt;&#39; + @Mon + &#39;&lt;--&#39; as [has extra spaces] ;\r\n    \r\n    go\r\n    \r\n    DECLARE @Mon char(2),\r\n            @Year char(5)\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = &#39;5&#39;\r\n    SET @Year = &#39;2019&#39;\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Mon as varchar(2))), 2)\r\n    SET @Year = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Year AS varchar(4))), 5)\r\n    --SELECT @Year\r\n    --SELECT @Mon\r\n    --SELECT @Year+@Mon\r\n    SELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + @Year + @Mon ;\r\n    SELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + &#39;--&gt;&#39; + @Year + &#39;&lt;-- --&gt;&#39; + @Mon + &#39;&lt;--&#39; as [no extra spaces] ;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135880/why-is-there-a-space-when-concatenating-varchars-in-this-sql-2008-query/58136134#58136134","title":"Why is there a space when concatenating varchars in this SQL 2008 query?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":10591336,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd6a4a1ff7fd6acd625bb736ca02bb30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akGuntuku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10591336/akguntuku"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569593288,"creation_date":1569593288,"answer_id":58136207,"question_id":58135880,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58136207","body_markdown":"    DECLARE @Mon varchar(3),\r\n            @Year varchar(5)\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = &#39;5&#39;\r\n    SET @Year = &#39;2019&#39;\r\n    \r\n    SET @Mon = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Mon as varchar(2))), 2)\r\n    SET @Year = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Year AS varchar(4))), 5)\r\n    SELECT @Year\r\n    SELECT @Mon\r\n    SELECT @Year+@Mon\r\n    \r\n    SELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + @Year + @Mon ;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58135880/why-is-there-a-space-when-concatenating-varchars-in-this-sql-2008-query/58136207#58136207","title":"Why is there a space when concatenating varchars in this SQL 2008 query?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":852661,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qqb7t.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mat Landers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/852661/mat-landers"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58136015,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569593288,"creation_date":1569592093,"question_id":58135880,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58135880","body_markdown":"I was tasked with setting up a control number based on month and date that are passed into a stored procedure.

Specifically ```SELECT RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM( CAST( DATEPART( MONTH, GETDATE() ) AS varchar(2)) ) , 2)```.\r\n\r\nMy issues is that I somehow get a space inserted when I concatenate a month and a year even though each variable individually does NOT include a space.\r\n\r\nConsider:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDECLARE @Mon char(3),\r\n        @Year char(6)\r\n\r\nSET @Mon = &#39;5&#39;\r\nSET @Year = &#39;2019&#39;\r\n\r\nSET @Mon = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Mon as varchar(2))), 2)\r\nSET @Year = RIGHT(&#39;00&#39; + RTRIM(CAST(@Year AS varchar(4))), 5)\r\nSELECT @Year\r\nSELECT @Mon\r\nSELECT @Year+@Mon\r\n\r\nSELECT &#39;Z_&#39; + @Year + @Mon ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected result is that I would get ```Z_0201905``` but I get ```Z_02019 05```.\r\nInitially I thought it is because I declared @Mon as char(3) but even changing that to char(2) has the same behavior.\r\nChanging @Year to char(5) and adding a 0 to ```SELECT &#39;Z_0&#39; + @Year + @Mon;``` yields the same result.\r\nSetting @Mon variable to something higher than 9, such as 12, still yields the same result of having a space.\r\n\r\nRunning ```SELECT @@VERSION``` yields: ```Microsoft SQL Server 2008 (SP3) - 10.0.5538.0 (X64)   Apr  3 2015 14:50:02   Copyright (c) 1988-2008 Microsoft Corporation  Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows NT 6.1 &lt;X64&gt; (Build 7601: Service Pack 1) (VM) ```\r\n\r\nI tried using CONCAT but through Stack Overflow found that the function isn&#39;t available until SQL Server 2012.\r\n\r\nWhat is causing the space?
