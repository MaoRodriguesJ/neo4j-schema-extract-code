Use qsize() == 0\r\n        as a direct substitute, but be aware that either approach risks a race\r\n        condition where a queue can grow before the result of empty() or\r\n        qsize() can be used.\r\n        To create code that needs to wait for all queued tasks to be\r\n        completed, the preferred technique is to use the join() method.\r\n        &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n        with self.mutex:\r\n            return not self._qsize()\r\n\r\n~snip\r\n```\r\n\r\nMust have missed this helpful docstring when I was originally looking. The `qsize` bool is not tied to the state of the queue once it&#39;s evaluated. So the user is doing processing against a queue based on an already out-of-date state.\r\n\r\nLike checking the existence of a file, it&#39;s more pythonic to just handle the exception:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    task = _queue.get(timeout=4)\r\nexcept Empty as e:\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince the exception/success against `get` *is* the state of the queue.\r\n\r\nLikewise, we would not do:\r\n```python\r\nif os.exists(file):\r\n    with open(file) as fh:\r\n        # do processing\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we would do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    with open(file) as fh:\r\n        # do processing\r\nexcept FileNotFoundError as e:\r\n    # do something else\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suppose the intentional leaving-out of the `__bool__` method by the author is to steer the developer *away* from leaning against such a paradigm, and treating the queue like you would any other object that might be of questionable state.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176203/why-doesnt-python-queue-have-falsey-behavior/58206546#58206546","title":"Why doesn&#39;t python Queue have falsey behavior"}],"owner":{"reputation":5736,"user_id":7867968,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c6976c101b7e5d81ad398cedf6a2ab9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C.Nivs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7867968/c-nivs"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58176248,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570037797,"creation_date":1569884144,"question_id":58176203,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176203","body_markdown":"In python, I have gotten quite used to container objects having truthy behavior when they are populated, and falsey behavior when they are not:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# list\r\na = []\r\nnot a\r\nTrue\r\n\r\na.append(1)\r\nnot a\r\nFalse\r\n\r\n# deque\r\nfrom collections import deque\r\nd = deque()\r\nnot d\r\nTrue\r\n\r\nd.append(1)\r\nnot d\r\nFalse\r\n\r\n# and so on\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, [queue.Queue](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html#queue.Queue) does not have this behavior. To me, this seems odd and a contradiction against almost any other container data type that I can think of. Furthermore, the method `empty` on queue seem to go against coding conventions that avoid race conditions on any other object (checking if a file exists, checking if a list is empty, etc). For example, we would generally say the following is bad practice:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_queue = []\r\n\r\nif not len(_queue):\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd should be replaced with\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_queue = []\r\n\r\nif not _queue:\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\nor to handle an `IndexError`, which we might still argue would be better with the `if not _queue` statement:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    x = _queue.pop()\r\nexcept IndexError as e:\r\n    logger.exception(e)\r\n    # do something else\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, `Queue` requires someone to do one of the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n_queue = queue.Queue()\r\n\r\nif _queue.empty():\r\n    # do something\r\n    # though this smells like a race condition\r\n\r\n\r\n# or handle an exception\r\ntry:\r\n    _queue.get(timeout=5)\r\nexcept Empty as e:\r\n    # do something else\r\n    # maybe logger.exception(e)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there documentation somewhere that might point to *why* this design choice was made? It seems odd, especially when [the source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/queue.py) shows that it was built on top of `collections.deque` (noted that Queue does *not* inherit from `deque`)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176203/why-doesnt-python-queue-have-falsey-behavior","title":"Why doesn&#39;t python Queue have falsey

Deliberately, `countDown()` is never called on this latch.\r\n\r\nI have a `ShutdownHook` that interrupts the thread that calls `myLatch.await()`, and I have a catch block that deals with the subsequent `InterruptedException`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m observing that when my shutdown hook is invoked, the latch &quot;wakes up&quot; normally.  That is, the `await()` method returns, the thread is not interrupted, and its interrupted status (as reported by `isInterrupted()`) is `false`.\r\n\r\n**My understanding from the `CountDownLatch` documentation is that this scenario is impossible.  What am I missing?**\r\n\r\nThe code where the latch is awaited looks like this:\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        myLatch.await();\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;*** done via unblock&quot;);\r\n    } catch (final InterruptedException interruptedException) {\r\n        Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;*** done via interrupt&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI see `*** done via unblock` when I CTRL-C my application.  My read of the documentation is that this is impossible because `CountDownLatch` instances are not subject to spurious wakeups.\r\n\r\nThe shutdown hook code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    // t is the thread that is doing the await() call above\r\n    final Thread t = Thread.currentThread();\r\n    Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(() -&gt; {\r\n          t.interrupt();\r\n          try {\r\n              t.join();\r\n          } catch (final InterruptedException interruptedException) {\r\n            Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\r\n          }\r\n     }));","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176200/how-can-a-countdownlatch-that-is-not-counted-down-to-zero-return-without-being-i","title":"How can a CountDownLatch that is not counted down to zero return without being interrupted?"},{"tags":["android","transactions","deprecated"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":816527,"user_id":115145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDnd8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CommonsWare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569884599,"post_id":58176199,"comment_id":102733076,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176199/how-to-change-deprecated-room-transaction-without-spoiling-fuctionality#comment102733076_58176199"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11307510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50de7b1c5956c8a76641b6b9caba64a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mantas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11307510/mantas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":816527,"user_id":115145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDnd8.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CommonsWare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569925818,"post_id":58176199,"comment_id":102745540,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176199/how-to-change-deprecated-room-transaction-without-spoiling-fuctionality#comment102745540_58176199"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11307510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50de7b1c5956c8a76641b6b9caba64a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mantas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11307510/mantas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11307510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/50de7b1c5956c8a76641b6b9caba64a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mantas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11307510/mantas"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570526743,"creation_date":1569884102,"last_edit_date":1570526743,"question_id":58176199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176199","body_markdown":"So room has deprecated the beginTransaction/setTransactionSuccessful/endTransaction and allows to use runnables and callables as replacement with runInTransaction() function. \r\n\r\nBut as far as i know, i can&#39;t get a return value from runnable or callable.

Based on the `request.user` I try to switch who of the two the other user is depending on who is logged in. The thing is that in the template I feel bound to use `chat.other_user`, which to my knowledge, can only be added as a property to the model.\r\n\r\nNow, I know this is an anti-pattern, the model should not carry request-specific properties. I just don&#39;t know how else to solve it.. I&#39;ve considered context_processors, template_tags, remodeling. One of the solutions I&#39;ve found is to use middleware to store `request.user` in a variable, but that doesn&#39;t sound right to me. The following code will not work but gives an idea of what I am trying to do:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Chat(models.Model):\r\n    user1 = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, null=True, related_name=&#39;+&#39;, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\r\n    user2 = models.ForeignKey(settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, null=True, related_name=&#39;+&#39;, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\r\n    start_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)\r\n\r\n    def other_user(self, request):\r\n        if request.user == self.user1:\r\n            return self.user2\r\n        elif request.user == self.user2:\r\n            return self.user1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% for chat in chat_list %}\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Chat with: {{ chat.other_user.username }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried to make it work with class-based views but I saw no way so I ended up doing the following. However, this feels hacky and I am trying to find a solution which is reusable for several views.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef other_user(chat_object, request):\r\n    if request.user == chat_object.user1:\r\n        return chat_object.user2\r\n    elif request.user == chat_object.user2:\r\n        return chat_object.user1\r\n\r\ndef chat_list(request):\r\n    chats = Chat.objects.filter(id__in=Message.objects.values(&#39;chat&#39;))\r\n\r\n    for chat in chats:\r\n        chat.other_user = other_user(chat, request)\r\n\r\n    return render(request, &#39;website/chat_list.html&#39;, {&#39;chat_list&#39;: chats})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a more straightforward way to be able to work with a chat model instance in the template, that has a &#39;shortcut&#39; to know which of the two is the other user?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176193/django-current-request-user-in-model-method","title":"Django current request.user in model method"},{"tags":["php","yii2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1344,"user_id":3689364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wGCo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EliteRaceElephant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689364/eliteraceelephant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569898486,"post_id":58176191,"comment_id":102735457,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages#comment102735457_58176191"},{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1344,"user_id":3689364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wGCo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EliteRaceElephant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689364/eliteraceelephant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569899507,"post_id":58176191,"comment_id":102735639,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages#comment102735639_58176191"},{"owner":{"reputation":779,"user_id":6592881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ciVbN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sfili_81","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6592881/sfili-81"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569912031,"post_id":58176191,"comment_id":102738704,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages#comment102738704_58176191"},{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569971335,"post_id":58176191,"comment_id":102765840,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages#comment102765840_58176191"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570360226,"post_id":58233914,"comment_id":102882333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages/58233914#comment102882333_58233914"},{"owner":{"reputation":1827,"user_id":897266,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRBmk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harry B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/897266/harry-b"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570435795,"post_id":58233914,"comment_id":102898946,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages/58233914#comment102898946_58233914"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1827,"user_id":897266,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pRBmk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Harry B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/897266/harry-b"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570182529,"creation_date":1570182529,"answer_id":58233914,"question_id":58176191,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58233914","body_markdown":"You will never stop people from using the browser&#39;s default navigation options. Whether than be browser back buttons, or swiping to navigate backwards. I&#39;ve seen people in user experience testing sessions swipe to navigate backward by mistake.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to lock the door, we need to deal with what happens on the previous page(s) should they achieve the back navigation. Let&#39;s deal with the posibility that it may happen.\r\n\r\nThere are two pieces to what you&#39;re trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nThe first is to stop the browser from caching the previous page(s). This means any back navigation will trigger a request to the server to get the information.\r\n\r\nWe can stop this by adding headers to the page content of sensitive pages:\r\nSend `cache control: no-cache`, `pragma: no-cache` and `expire: -1` headers.\r\n\r\nThe second part is to decide what to do if somebody does navigate back, and the server gets a request for that page again.\r\n\r\nYou certainly want to mark the session as &#39;resident&#39; on the first hit of the resident page. From there if the session has a &#39;resident&#39; marker in the session, you may choose to show a warning with a link back to the page they should be visiting, or simply redirect them back to it without intereaction. Personally I think the warning with a link is clearer and will stop confusion.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176191/prevent-user-from-navigating-through-other-pages/58233914#58233914","title":"Prevent user from navigating through other pages"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7,"user_id":6733715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb62d5d0f8f72fb611cd9f789c010598?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsnight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6733715/fsnight"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":6,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-6,"last_activity_date":1570182529,"creation_date":1569884000,"last_edit_date":1569971296,"question_id":58176191,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176191","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s the scenario, I have 2 user which is the Employee and Resident.\r\n\r\nThe Employee has an account on our website wherein they can see all the Residents&#39; documents and they can select those documents so that the Resident can fill it up.\r\n\r\nBTW the Resident doesn&#39;t have an account on the website. The only way they can fill up the said documents is by sending an email to them which contains an API or through a device that will be given to them onsite and has a login session of an Employee.\r\n\r\nHow can I prevent the Resident from navigating through other pages (Go back) once the device is given to them because the Employee cannot always monitor the Resident&#39;s action.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nEdit: So what I&#39;ve done previously is I have separate accounts for these users but after thinking thoroughly, an account for the Resident is unnecessary specially when they&#39;re too old to use devices.

Like the above answer says, you could use `new Date(element.start)` to actually get a date object. You can then call `getTime()` on that object and use it to compare.

For each messenger, for each contact, I want to get a list of all messages sent and received (since installing my app). The key thing here, is that I want the list of messages to be in order. My app should support as many messengers as possible. What would be the best way to do this?\r\n\r\nI researched and found a few ways to access messengers&#39; messages:\r\n\r\n- Using accessibility services\r\n(Related: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35842762/how-to-read-window-content-using-accessibilityservice-and-evoking-ui-using-dra)\r\n  - to read the screen content of other apps that is annotated with accessibility labels\r\n  - caveats:\r\n      - the messenger needs to have accessibility implemented correctly\r\n      - I have to filter which text blobs are relevant\r\n- Using `NotificationListenerService`\r\n  - to get the content of notifications for received messages\r\n  - caveats:\r\n     - only gets content of messages for which there was a notification\r\n     - except for their time, there is no order of the messages given\r\n\r\n- taking screenshots and doing optical character recognition\r\n  - caveats:\r\n     - probably insane\r\n\r\nWhen I get the messages, I still have to order them. For this, I think, the accessibility services are my best bet as I could use the date information on screen in most messages, and also their position on the screen.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is still an edge case. As I understand it, accessibility services can only see the content currently on the screen. The user might also use another device to chat while the device with the app installed is powered off. Thus, once the device with the app installed is powered on again, the app might not be able to see the old messages written while the device was powered off (until the user scrolls up again).\r\n\r\nAre my assumptions correct?

   return\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nthe problem is that my API&#39;s randomly got this error:\r\n\r\n    java.net.SocketTimeoutException\r\nand every time is one of my API&#39;s that get this error although i get my requests response immediately on postman and there is no error on my server side application.\r\ndo you think this is because of the serveo thing and it will be solved if i run it on a real server or it is because of my android code?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176133/http-request-timeout-on-error-android-app","title":"http request timeout on error android

depends on the specific `List` implementation.\r\nLet&#39;s look at what `Object.equals` does:\r\n\r\n    public static boolean equals(Object a, Object b) {\r\n        return (a == b) || (a != null &amp;&amp; a.equals(b));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo it checks for a couple of trivial cases, then calls `a.equals(b)`, which means that it will call the `equals` method of your list. But if you&#39;re using some custom `List` or just some list that doesn&#39;t compare the elements one by one, then the two implementation will be different.\r\n\r\nFor any sane implementation, `equals` should iterate over the elements and compare each one using `equals`. This is what `AbstractList` does.\r\n\r\nAlso note that your hash code will probably change between implementations.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176130/hashcode-and-equals-with-a-list-property/58176187#58176187","title":"hashCode and equals with a list property"}],"owner":{"reputation":1427,"user_id":1279180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59873d5c010ca863c32c41281faf81bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279180/nimo23"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1427,"user_id":1279180,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/59873d5c010ca863c32c41281faf81bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nimo23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279180/nimo23"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58176187,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569912302,"creation_date":1569883450,"last_edit_date":1569912302,"question_id":58176130,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176130","body_markdown":"I have a class with a **for-loop within the equals/hashCode**:\r\n\r\n    class User {\r\n    \r\n    private List&lt;Task&gt; tasks;\r\n    private ZonedDateTime date;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {    \r\n    \tint hash = 17;\r\n    \thash = 31 * hash + (date != null ? date() : 0);\r\n    \tfor (var task : tasks) {\r\n    \t\thash = 31 * hash + task.hashCode();\r\n         }\r\n    \r\n    \treturn hash;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t@Override\r\n    \tpublic boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n    \t\tif (this == obj) return true;\r\n    \t\tif (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;\r\n    \r\n    \t\tfinal User other = (User) obj;\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (tasks.size() != other.tasks.size()) return false;\r\n\r\n            // needed?\r\n    \t\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; tasks.size(); i++) {\r\n    \t\t\tif (!tasks.get(i).equals(other.tasks.get(i))) {\r\n    \t\t\t\treturn false;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\treturn Objects.equals(timeStamp, other.timeStamp) &amp;&amp; Objects.equals(tasks, other. tasks);\r\n    \r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI am used to have this version **(version 2)** of equals/hashCode, which is shorter and faster:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int hashCode() {\r\n        return Objects.hash(date, tasks);\r\n    }\r\n        \r\n    @Override\r\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\r\n        if (this == obj) return true;\r\n        if (obj == null || getClass() != obj.getClass()) return false;\r\n        \r\n        final User other = (User) obj;\r\n        return Objects.equals(timeStamp, other.timeStamp) &amp;&amp; Objects.equals(tasks, other. tasks);\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nCan I replace the former equals/hashCode with the version 2 without worrying about correctness? \r\n\r\nAre both versions return the same result?\r\n\r\n**To sum up:**\r\n\r\nfor typcial List implementation we can use version 2 instead of version 1. \r\n\r\n**One additional question related to this:**\r\n\r\nWill **version 2** be also valid, if the property `task` is not a `List` but a `Stream`?

I have also tried .DisposeOf, .Free and :=nil.\r\n```\r\nListView.BeginUpdate;\r\nfor i:=0 to ListView.Items.Count -1 do\r\nbegin\r\n    try\r\n      ThumbBit := TBitmap.Create(0,0);\r\n      tbit2 :=  TBitmap.Create(0,0);\r\n      aitem := ListView.items.AppearanceItem[i];\r\n      draw2 := ListView.Items.Item[i].View.FindDrawable(&#39;thumbpath&#39;);\r\n      thumbpath:= draw2.Data.ToString;\r\n      LThumb := (AItem.Objects.FindDrawable(&#39;imagethumb&#39;) as TListItemImage);\r\n      try\r\n          ThumbBit.LoadThumbnailFromFile(thumbpath, 60, 90, true);\r\n          Tbit2.Assign(ThumbBit);\r\n          LThumb.Bitmap:=Tbit2;\r\n      finally\r\n          FreeAndNil(tbit2);\r\n      end;\r\n    finally\r\n      FreeAndNil(ThumbBit);\r\n    end;\r\nend;\r\nListView.EndUpdate;\r\n```\r\nApplication works fine but results in the error &#39;Unexpected Memory Leak error occurs&#39; when closing the application on windows.

It disconnects the serve.\r\n\r\nI am thinking the issues are on `file.choose()` since the interactive file selection dialog wouldn&#39;t show up.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how to get the `file.choose()` working, or any other solutions?\r\n\r\nAgain I am trying to push a local file to an FTP server through an online Shiny App.\r\n_________________\r\n&lt;b&gt;Update:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nI have checked the log and I get this error:\r\n````\r\nWarning in file(what, &quot;rb&quot;) : cannot open file &#39;xt&#39;: No such file or directory\r\nWarning: Error in file: cannot open the connection\r\n````\r\n\r\nI am using a windows. and this error won&#39;t appear when I run the app locally from my RStudio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176070/error-when-using-file-choose-in-shiny-web-app-deployed-online","title":"Error when using file.choose() in Shiny Web App (deployed online)"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":618,"user_id":3903479,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecfc19ef8fc5b356429814cb785bec8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GammaGames","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3903479/gammagames"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569884570,"post_id":58176068,"comment_id":102733070,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176068/nested-modals-zoom-blurring-issue-with-closing-modals#comment102733070_58176068"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":2675647,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3998c5fd3776be1a41b14ba99c68c96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2675647","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2675647/user2675647"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":618,"user_id":3903479,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecfc19ef8fc5b356429814cb785bec8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GammaGames","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3903479/gammagames"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570043337,"post_id":58176068,"comment_id":102793729,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176068/nested-modals-zoom-blurring-issue-with-closing-modals#comment102793729_58176068"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":2675647,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":17,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3998c5fd3776be1a41b14ba99c68c96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2675647","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2675647/user2675647"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569882896,"creation_date":1569882896,"question_id":58176068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176068","body_markdown":"I am trying to add some functionality to this setup.\r\nAs you will see, it is an attempt to make a nested modal setup, that on every click on a modal link, it recedes and blurs everything behind the modal.\r\n\r\nI have managed to make it work, but I am trying to do two things:\r\n\r\n1.

TraverseController is form&#39;s class name.\r\n\r\nThis looks like a VB default form instance issue.  It is apparent that you are trying to properly marshal control interaction back to the UI thread by using checking `TraverseController.InvokeRequired`.  However, due to the way these default instance are created, `TraverseController.InvokeRequired` is creating a new instance of `TraverseController` on the secondary thread and all subsequent code is modifying that instance and not the one created on the UI thread.\r\n\r\nOne way to deal with this is to pass a synchronizing control instance to the class where `PositionChanged` changed method is defined and check that control&#39;s `InvokeRequired` method instead of `TraverseController.InvokeRequired`.

It is simply a matter of timing or in other words when things get executed. In your code (which isn&#39;t very well structured but onto that later) you execute\r\n\r\n `let clothes = document.getElementById(&#39;cloth&#39;).value;`\r\n\r\nat the very beginning of the script. In this case you are not obtaining some form of reference that would allow you to read the value at later stage but the actual value at the time. Since your `input` field has `value` attribute set to empty string, this is all you will ever get no matter how many times you execute the function later.\r\n\r\nIn order to get value of the input at the time of calling your method **you would have to move it into the function itself**.\r\n\r\nBut as I mentioned earlier your code is overall structured poorly so allow me to provide a few suggestions.\r\n\r\n1. `button` of type submit by default executes submission of the form if placed within the form; you are not taking advantage of that (this has benefits such ability to submit form with &quot;Enter&quot; key e.g.\r\n\r\n2. placing `&lt;script&gt;` in the middle of your document is poor choice as it blocks rendering of the rest of the document. Best options are to place it either within `&lt;head&gt;` when used with `defer` attribute or at the end of the document just before closing `&lt;/body&gt;` tag.\r\n\r\n3. Nesting your function within each other has not benefit here. You can easily define them independently and call one within the other if needed.\r\n\r\n4. heading element `&lt;h4&gt;` cannot appear within `&lt;p&gt;` tag\r\n\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;Madder Libs&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n        &lt;form action=&quot;/&quot; onsubmit=&quot;return showThis()&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;label for=&quot;cloth&quot;&gt;Piece of clothing:&lt;/label&gt;\r\n            &lt;input id=&quot;cloth&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;div id=&quot;madlibs&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Show Message&lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;script&gt;\r\n          // let&#39;s get references to our elements, so we don&#39;t have to\r\n          // do it multiple times\r\n          let clothes = document.getElementById(&#39;cloth&#39;);\r\n          let madlibs = document.getElementById(&#39;madlibs&#39;);\r\n\r\n          // let&#39;s define our functions\r\n          function display(message) {\r\n            let sayThis = `I wear a ${message.a} on sundays.`;\r\n            return sayThis;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          function showThis() {\r\n            const clothesValue = clothes.value;\r\n            let libs = {\r\n                a: clothesValue,\r\n                /*b: firstBodyPart,\r\n                c: secondBodyPart,\r\n                d: verbOne,\r\n                e: thirdBodyPart,\r\n                f: verbTwo,\r\n                g: firstNoun,\r\n                h: secondNoun,\r\n                i: verbThree,*/\r\n            };\r\n            madlibs.innerHTML += &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot; + display(libs);\r\n            return false;\r\n          }\r\n        &lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176037/how-to-display-html-from-input-box/58179285#58179285","title":"How to display HTML from input box"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11986135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e9bc7c4d5c0690634e8d3d07104f3de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"p4yner56","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11986135/p4yner56"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569913652,"creation_date":1569882673,"question_id":58176037,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176037","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to display a message that appears after the user has input some details into input boxes.

The state register should be declared as an `int`. The tape should be declared as a variable of a doubly-linked list type defined as a C++ class, where each node corresponds to one cell on the tape. The action table should be declared as a variable of an array-based list type defined as a C++ class, where each item corresponds to a struct consisting of five members corresponding to: (1) the current state, (2) the symbol read from the tape, (3) the next state, (4) the symbol to be written to the tape, and (5) the direction to move the read/write pointer, respectively. Each item in the action table corresponds to a “command” with the following format:\r\n\r\n&gt; (current state, symbol read) -&gt; (next state, symbol to write) -&gt; direction to next cell\r\n\r\n&gt; The current state and next state members should be of type `int`. The symbol read and symbol to write members should be of type `char`. The values of current state, symbol read, next state and symbol to write are problem dependent. The symbol B is a reserved symbol used to indicate that a cell is empty (i.e., blank). The direction to next cell member should be of type `char`, where L, - (i.e., the dash character), R, and H correspond to moving the read/write pointer to the left, no movement, moving to the right, and halting the computation (i.e., the problem is solved), respectively. Your C++ classes should be implementations of the doubly-linked list algorithms given on the CS210 Algorithms web page. Do not waste your time implementing any algorithms that you don&#39;t actually need.\r\n\r\n&gt; Prior to solving a problem using your Turing machine, the tape, state register, and action table must be initialized, and the read/write pointer must be positioned over a cell. To make your Turing machine capable of solving multiple problems, read the initial values from a text file containing data of the following format:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```none\r\ninitial_state_register_value \r\ninitial_tape_values\r\nfirst_row_of_action_table_values\r\n.  \r\n.  \r\n.  \r\nlast_row_of_action_table_values\r\n-1 // action table terminator\r\ninitial_read_write_pointer_position\r\n&gt;```\r\n\r\n&gt; For example, a text file containing the following values will &quot;program&quot; your Turing machine to count to 16 in binary.\r\n\r\n&gt;```none\r\n0 // initial state\r\nB 0 0 0 0 B // initial cell values on tape\r\n0 0 0 0 R // move right\r\n0 1 0 1 R // move right\r\n0 B 1 B L // when a blank at the right is found, change to state 1 and move left\r\n1 0 0 1 R // if a 0 is changed to 1, change to state 0 and move right\r\n1 1 1 0 L // if a 1 is changed to 0, move left\r\n1 B 0 1 H // if a B is changed to 1, stop\r\n-1 // end of action table\r\n6 // initial position of read/write pointer\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\n&gt; Your program should print out the contents of the tape (and the position of the read/write pointer), from left to right: (1) after it is initialized, (2) after each intermediate computation (i.e., after an individual action is completed), and (3) after the computation halts. For example, the initial cell values on the tape and the initial position of the read/write pointer (represented by the character ^) would print as follows:\r\n\r\n&gt; ```none\r\nB 0 0 0 0 B\r\n          ^\r\n&gt; ```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve understood what the action table takes in as values. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m having difficulty with now is trying to get just the first line read into an integer variable, the second line into the linked list class, the third to the &#39;-1&#39; line into the list by array class and the last line gets read in as an argument for a function that sets the pointer in the linked list. \r\n\r\nBasically, my question is how can I get the end of a line and then set where that line is read to? \r\n\r\nMost of what I know of reading from a file involves reading the entire file and then reading that to one variable.

The object here is getting an odd value indicating that the memory mapping was bad. My thought on this is because it is being copied into the function instead of a reference update. The original answer showed the manipulation under a scoped function that allowed the reference and memory re-use. \r\n\r\nIn particular, from the [`armadillo` docs on advanced ctors](http://arma.sourceforge.net/docs.html#Mat): \r\n\r\n&gt; Create a matrix using data from writable auxiliary (external) memory, where ptr_aux_mem is a pointer to the memory. By default the matrix allocates its own memory and copies data from the auxiliary memory (for safety). **However, if copy_aux_mem is set to false, the matrix will instead directly use the auxiliary memory (ie. no copying); this is faster, but can be dangerous unless you know what you are doing!**\r\n\r\nThe latter part is my emphasis.\r\n\r\nSo, here under a pass-by-copy paradigm, the object needs to be fully copied vs. a reference update if writing a common cast function.\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\narma::mat matrixxd_to_armamat(Eigen::MatrixXd eigen_A) {\r\n    arma::mat arma_B = arma::mat(eigen_A.data(), eigen_A.rows(), eigen_A.cols(),\r\n                                 true,   // changed from false to true.\r\n                                 false); \r\n    return arma_B;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if you are okay with linking back to the original `Eigen` object through a reference, then this should work: \r\n\r\n```cpp\r\narma::mat matrixxd_to_armamat2(Eigen::MatrixXd&amp; eigen_A) {\r\n    arma::mat arma_B = arma::mat(eigen_A.data(), eigen_A.rows(), eigen_A.cols(),\r\n                                 false, false);\r\n    return arma_B;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning both yields:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntester()\r\n# 1 -1\r\n# 2 -2\r\n#   1.0000  -1.0000\r\n#   2.0000  -2.0000\r\n#\r\n#   1.0000  -1.0000\r\n#   2.0000  -2.0000\r\n#\r\n#     [,1] [,2]\r\n#[1,]    1   -1\r\n#[2,]    2   -2\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176022/converting-eigenmatrixxd-to-armamat-and-make-a-copy-on-a-new-object/58176164#58176164","title":"Converting Eigen::MatrixXd to arma::mat and make a copy on a new object"}],"owner":{"reputation":7453,"user_id":2775630,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sViwd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkln","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2775630/mkln"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7453,"user_id":2775630,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sViwd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mkln","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2775630/mkln"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58176164,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569883833,"creation_date":1569882489,"last_edit_date":1569882896,"question_id":58176022,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176022","body_markdown":"I have a function within which I want to convert an `Eigen::MatrixXd` object to `arma::mat`. \r\n\r\nI am aware of [this question][1] but I can&#39;t seem to be able to correct the behavior that I&#39;m getting.

The result runs, but I have a stiff time ahead of me to do a regression test to see if it doesn&#39;t crash in some cases now.

(and to practice clojure)\r\n\r\nlet&#39;s start with simple conversion function:\r\n\r\n    (defn convert [rules data]\r\n      (if-let [res (some (fn [[condition rewrite]]\r\n                           (when (condition data) (rewrite data)))\r\n                         rules)]\r\n        res\r\n        data))\r\n\r\nit finds first rule that suits your input (if any) and applies it&#39;s transformation function:\r\n\r\n    (def my-rules [[sequential? (fn [data] (map #(convert my-rules %) data))]\r\n                   [number? inc]\r\n                   [keyword? (comp clojure.string/upper-case name)]])\r\n    #&#39;user/my-rules\r\n\r\n    user&gt; (convert my-rules [:hello :guys &quot;i am&quot; 30 [:congratulate :me]])\r\n    ;;=&gt; (&quot;HELLO&quot; &quot;GUYS&quot; &quot;i am&quot; 31 (&quot;CONGRATULATE&quot; &quot;ME&quot;))\r\n\r\nwith this approach, your rules would look something like this:\r\n\r\n    (def rules\r\n      [[(every-pred coll? (comp #{&#39;not} first)) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [[#{&#39;not} (constantly &#39;nor)]]) data))]\r\n       [(every-pred coll? (comp #{&#39;or} first)) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [[#{&#39;or} (constantly &#39;nor)]]) data))]\r\n       [(every-pred coll? (comp #{&#39;and} first)) (fn [[_ &amp; t]] (cons &#39;nor (map #(list &#39;nor %) t)))]])\r\n    #&#39;user/rules\r\n\r\n    user&gt; (convert rules &#39;(and x y z))\r\n    ;;=&gt; (nor (nor x) (nor y) (nor z))\r\n\r\nok it works, but looks rather ugly. Still we can elimnate some repetitions introducing couple of basic functions for checkers and transformers:\r\n\r\n    (defn first-is \r\n      &quot;returns a function checking that the input is collection and it&#39;s head equals to value&quot;\r\n      [value]\r\n      (every-pred coll? (comp #{value} first)))\r\n\r\ntransforming your rules to:\r\n\r\n    (def rules\r\n      [[(first-is &#39;not) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [[#{&#39;not} (constantly &#39;nor)]]) data))]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;or) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [[#{&#39;or} (constantly &#39;nor)]]) data))]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;and) (fn [[_ &amp; t]] (cons &#39;nor (map #(list &#39;nor %) t)))]])\r\n    #&#39;user/rules\r\n    \r\n    user&gt; (convert rules &#39;(and x y z))\r\n    ;;=&gt; (nor (nor x) (nor y) (nor z))\r\n\r\nand then introducing replacing rewrite rule:\r\n\r\n    (defn replacing\r\n      ([new] [(constantly true) (constantly new)])\r\n      ([old new] [#{old} (constantly new)])) \r\n\r\nleading us to \r\n\r\n    (def rules\r\n      [[(first-is &#39;not) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [(replacing &#39;not &#39;nor)]) data))]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;or) (fn [data] (map (partial convert [(replacing &#39;or &#39;nor)]) data))]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;and) (fn [[_ &amp; t]] (cons &#39;nor (map #(list &#39;nor %) t)))]])\r\n\r\nnow we can see that there is a demand on a function, transforming every item in collection. let&#39;s introduce it:\r\n\r\n    (defn convert-each [rules]\r\n      (fn [data] (map #(convert rules %) data)))\r\n\r\n    (def rules\r\n      [[(first-is &#39;not) (convert-each [(replacing &#39;not &#39;nor)])]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;or) (convert-each [(replacing &#39;or &#39;nor)])]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;and) (fn [[_ &amp; t]] (cons &#39;nor (map #(list &#39;nor %) t)))]])\r\n\r\n    user&gt; (convert rules &#39;(or x y z))\r\n    ;;=&gt; (nor x y z)\r\n\r\n    user&gt; (convert rules &#39;(and x y z))\r\n    ;;=&gt; (nor (nor x) (nor y) (nor z))\r\n\r\nnow it is much better, but the last clause is still kind of ugly. I can think of introducing the function that transforms head and tail with separate rules and then conses transformed head and tail:\r\n\r\n    (defn convert-cons [head-rules tail-conversion]\r\n      (fn [[h &amp; t]] (cons (convert head-rules h) (tail-conversion t))))\r\n\r\n    (defn transforming [transformer]\r\n      [(constantly true) transformer])\r\n\r\n    (def rules\r\n      [[(first-is &#39;not) (convert-each [(replacing &#39;not &#39;nor)])]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;or) (convert-each [(replacing &#39;or &#39;nor)])]\r\n       [(first-is &#39;and) (convert-cons [(replacing &#39;nor)]\r\n                                      (convert-each [(transforming #(list &#39;nor %))]))]])\r\n\r\n    user&gt; (convert rules &#39;(and x y z))\r\n    ;;=&gt; (nor (nor x) (nor y) (nor z))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58176014/how-to-iterate-through-a-list-and-make-lists-of-the-elements/58185885#58185885","title":"How to iterate through a list and make lists of the elements"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"anon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11582,"user_id":1562315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db68e51797a2382e185b42ce6534b7a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thumbnail","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1562315/thumbnail"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":109,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570379624,"creation_date":1569882421,"last_edit_date":1570379624,"question_id":58176014,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58176014","body_markdown":"I am trying to convert logical functions in clojure.

You cannot attach, detach, modify, or delete this policy.&quot;. There might be a way to filter down to the service-linked policies in the AWS Console or CLI when desribing policies other than inspecting the paths, but it alludes me right now.\r\n\r\nYou can see their usage described here \r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/using-service-linked-roles.html.\r\n\r\nHere also is the blog post that describes what a service-linked role is https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/introducing-an-easier-way-to-delegate-permissions-to-aws-services-service-linked-roles/. Basically these are roles that can only be assumed by a specific service type.\r\n\r\nThe AWS managed policies in the `service-role` path are policies that can be attached to any role including &quot;normal/basic&quot; roles. These types of roles can be assumed by users, EC2 instances, or anywhere else roles are assumed.\r\n\r\nFor example you could give someone permission to attach a linked-service role that has the policy `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role/AWSLambdaReplicator` attached which is only attachable to a linked-role linked to the Lambda service. They would be able to use this role in the Lambda execution role, but they would not be able to use this role with another service like EC2 or an IAM user. This supports an admin allowing users to assign out permissions to new resources that users spins up (a new Lambda) that that the admin trusts the linked AWS service to use, but don&#39;t want to allow that user to access directly through their user account or give them to other custom applications running in AWS.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58175997/difference-between-policy-path-arnawsiamawspolicy-aws-service-role-and/58177033#58177033","title":"Difference between policy path &quot;arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/aws-service-role&quot;
