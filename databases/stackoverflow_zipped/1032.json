The central loading code is as below:\r\n\r\n    if (!DirectoryCatalogExists(catalog, dir)) TryLoadingCatalog(catalog, new DirectoryCatalog(dir));\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my case, the &#39;dir&#39; has a valid path such as: `C:\\dev\\Source\\bin\\Debug\\Plugins\\`. The `DirectoryCatalog` is supposed to find and load all of the DLLs in that folder. It indeed finds all of the DLL files, but it failed to load the main DLL (that references other support DLLs), so subsequently the `Parts.Any()` test will always fail, hence nothing is added to the overall catalog.

The example just uses 1 function per file as an example.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296920/node-js-use-modules-without-assigning-them-to-variables","title":"node.js use modules without assigning them to variables"},{"tags":["javascript","html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":11728928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2397435613656409/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fabio Assuncao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11728928/fabio-assuncao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594088,"post_id":58296919,"comment_id":102956903,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296919/open-toggle-div-when-scrolled#comment102956903_58296919"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12185797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB8kHuBlKSRvRc6L-hBAU1no7gBzrWp0xVZB_va=k-s128","display_name":"Marc Santos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12185797/marc-santos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":316,"user_id":11728928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2397435613656409/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fabio Assuncao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11728928/fabio-assuncao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594245,"post_id":58296919,"comment_id":102956930,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296919/open-toggle-div-when-scrolled#comment102956930_58296919"},{"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":11728928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2397435613656409/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fabio Assuncao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11728928/fabio-assuncao"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594564,"post_id":58296919,"comment_id":102956982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296919/open-toggle-div-when-scrolled#comment102956982_58296919"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12185797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB8kHuBlKSRvRc6L-hBAU1no7gBzrWp0xVZB_va=k-s128","display_name":"Marc Santos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12185797/marc-santos"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570594534,"post_id":58296978,"comment_id":102956973,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296919/open-toggle-div-when-scrolled/58296978#comment102956973_58296978"},{"owner":{"reputation":551,"user_id":11700321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/REacU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EGC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11700321/egc"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12185797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mB8kHuBlKSRvRc6L-hBAU1no7gBzrWp0xVZB_va=k-s128","display_name":"Marc Santos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12185797/marc-santos"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594586,"post_id":58296978,"comment_id":102956984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296919/open-toggle-div-when-scrolled/58296978#comment102956984_58296978"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":551,"user_id":11700321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/REacU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EGC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11700321/egc"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570594460,"creation_date":1570594460,"answer_id":58296978,"question_id":58296919,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58296978","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a really basic Javascript sample I whipped up: [JSFiddle][1]\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var divToOpen = document.getElementById(&#39;divToOpen&#39;);\r\n    divToOpen.style.display = &#39;none&#39;;\r\n\r\n    document.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, function(e){\r\n    \tdivToOpen.style.display = &#39;block&#39;;\r\n    }, true);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #divToOpen {\r\n      background-color: green;\r\n      height: 250px;\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n      color: white;

How can I achieve this?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296914/salesforce-passing-values-to-multipicklist-based-on-another-object","title":"Salesforce passing values to Multipicklist based on another object"},{"tags":["postgresql","psql"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25444,"user_id":1056563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc888aa658ab0e0d2a4d305ad7f69123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"javadba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1056563/javadba"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594471,"post_id":58296960,"comment_id":102956964,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296910/how-to-turn-off-output-to-file-in-postgresql/58296960#comment102956964_58296960"},{"owner":{"reputation":655,"user_id":6689725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qsOMmN7fB4g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/vTvjt2dZck4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Z4-tier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6689725/z4-tier"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25444,"user_id":1056563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc888aa658ab0e0d2a4d305ad7f69123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"javadba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1056563/javadba"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594705,"post_id":58296960,"comment_id":102957002,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296910/how-to-turn-off-output-to-file-in-postgresql/58296960#comment102957002_58296960"},{"owner":{"reputation":25444,"user_id":1056563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc888aa658ab0e0d2a4d305ad7f69123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"javadba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1056563/javadba"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570594788,"post_id":58296960,"comment_id":102957018,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296910/how-to-turn-off-output-to-file-in-postgresql/58296960#comment102957018_58296960"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":655,"user_id":6689725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qsOMmN7fB4g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/vTvjt2dZck4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Z4-tier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6689725/z4-tier"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570594302,"creation_date":1570594302,"answer_id":58296960,"question_id":58296910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58296960","body_markdown":"give it another `\\o` with no argument.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296910/how-to-turn-off-output-to-file-in-postgresql/58296960#58296960","title":"How to turn off &quot;output to file&quot; in postgresql"}],"owner":{"reputation":25444,"user_id":1056563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc888aa658ab0e0d2a4d305ad7f69123?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"javadba","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1056563/javadba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":655,"user_id":6689725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qsOMmN7fB4g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEI/vTvjt2dZck4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Z4-tier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6689725/z4-tier"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58296960,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570594739,"creation_date":1570593858,"last_edit_date":1570594739,"question_id":58296910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296910","body_markdown":"The directive\r\n   \r\n    \\o &lt;output_file&gt;\r\n\r\nsends subsequent outputs to the specified file.

3 (Mini calculator) In this question, you are asked to write a simple calculator. The user inputs the expression to be evaluated using the following format: Operand#1 operation Operand# 2 (without spaces.) For example 123+321 The operands are integer and your program should extract the operation and operands from the String and then print the result. For the sake of simplicity, the user should not use the space between the operand and operation. The operations are addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. User is free to enter any value but those values should not be negative. Here is an example of the output to illustrate the expected behavior of your program. The yellow highlights are your input to the program and the green highlights are the program output Hello to mini calculator program.

My guess is because the `transform: translateY()` is being modified so frequently (although i kinda thought that was part of the main reason for using `requestAnimationFrame()`... to be sure the browser only made the updates when it could handle it). I know removing the the `transition` from the CSS will stop this but then I lose my &quot;chase&quot; effect.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to set a delay as I could with `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`... or is there a different way I should be going about achieving that effect? or if not, can anything be done about the flickering or is that just the nature of the beast?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codepen.io/daveh0/pen/pooJRNL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296868/can-a-delay-be-set-on-requestanimationframe","title":"can a delay be set on requestAnimationFrame()?"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","keras"],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":3443033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bfd6578e70f3d6739c5d38d6a11a467?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3443033","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3443033/user3443033"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570593512,"creation_date":1570593512,"question_id":58296864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296864","body_markdown":"I am using Keras to train the generative adversarial network.

The problem is, my data table messes it up to where there are some NaN values in a different row in comparison to another column where it may or may not have a NaN value. For example: \r\n\r\n```\r\n# I use num1 as my y-coordinate and num1-num2 for my x-coordinate.\r\nnum1 num2 num3 \r\n1    NaN  25 \r\nNaN  7    45\r\n3    8    63\r\nNaN  NaN  23\r\n5    10   42\r\nNaN  4    44\r\n\r\n#So in this case, there should be only 2 data point on the graph between num1 and num2. For num1 and num3, there should be 3. There should be 4 data points between num2 and num3.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe Matplotlib doesn&#39;t graph the rows of the column that contain NaN values since its null (please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I can only tell this due to no dots being on the 0 coordinate of the x and y axes). In the beginning, I thought I could get away with using .count() and find the smaller of the two columns and use that as my tracker, but realistically that won&#39;t work as shown in my example above because it can be even LESS than that since one may have the NaN value and the other will have an actual value. Some examples of code I did: \r\n\r\n```\r\n# both x and y are columns within the DataFrame and are used to &quot;count&quot; how many data points are # being graphed.\r\ndef findAmountOfDataPoints(colA, colB):\r\n    if colA.count() &lt; colB.count():\r\n         print(colA.count())           # Since its a smaller value, print the number of values in colA.\r\n    else: \r\n         print(colB.count())              # Since its a smaller value, print the number of values in colB.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, I thought about using .value_count() but I&#39;m not sure if thats the exact function I&#39;m looking for to complete what I want. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nEdit 1: Changed Data Frame names to make example clearer hopefully.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296857/how-many-data-points-are-plotted-on-my-matplotlib-graph","title":"How many data points are plotted on my matplotlib graph?"},{"tags":["objective-c","dji-sdk"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12185728,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2Y6JBelMnKA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcyfpRcsjbua2lFuCDflBeZKphoUw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bryan O&#39;Rourke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12185728/bryan-orourke"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570593466,"creation_date":1570593466,"question_id":58296855,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296855","body_markdown":"I am trying, without success so far, to adapt the TimeLine Mission Objective-C [iOS example in the DJI Mobile SDK](https://github.com/dji-sdk/Mobile-SDK-iOS/blob/master/Sample%20Code/ObjcSampleCode/DJISdkDemo/Demo/MissionManager/TimelineMissionViewController.m) for my use case.

Render a `js.erb` template from your server**\r\n\r\nA `js.erb` file contains javascript code that will we sent from the server and executed on the frontend. \r\n\r\nSimply put, instead of rendering classic HTML, the server will send back the javascript code you write in your `js.erb` file. The advantage of such an approach is that you can use ruby in your template and render your comments html instead of building it from scratch. (see the link to the rails docs below for more details)\r\n\r\nIn your controller:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef show\r\n  @comments = Comment.all\r\n\r\n  respond_to do |format|\r\n    format.js\r\n    format.html\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your `views/comments/show.js.erb` file (which will be render by the server):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(&quot;#comments&quot;).html(&#39;&lt;%= j render @comments %&gt;&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your view `view/comments/show.html.erb`\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction reloadComments() {\r\n  $.ajax({\r\n    type: &#39;GET&#39;,\r\n    url: &#39;/comments&#39;,\r\n    dataType: &#39;script&#39;\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Trigger after loading the page\r\n$(function() {\r\n  setTimeout(reloadComments, 3000);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n[More info in Rails docs here][1]\r\n\r\n**2.

The Rails view will poll the server for any updates (new comments), and keep updating the page accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo far I have managed to use `setTimeout` to get requests sent to the server every 3 seconds (which I can see because I get an alert every 3 seconds).\r\n\r\nBut how do I feed this information back to the view, or more specifically, how do I replace the `@comments` that are rendered with the new list of comments that I got back in the response?\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;!-- index.html.erb --&gt;\r\n&lt;h1&gt;List of comments&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div id=&quot;comments&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;%= render @comments %&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nfunction reloadComments() {\r\n  $.get(&#39;/&#39;, function(data, status) {\r\n    alert(&quot;Data: &quot; + data.comments + &quot;\\nStatus: &quot; + status);\r\n  });\r\n  setTimeout(reloadComments, 3000);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Trigger after loading the page\r\n$(function() {\r\n  setTimeout(reloadComments, 3000);\r\n});\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;!--_comment.html.erb--&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;comment&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;&lt;%= comment.content %&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe controller method that is called with the HTTP GET call returns all the comments as a JSON like this:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef show\r\n  @comments = Comment.all\r\n\r\n  respond_to do |format|\r\n    format.json { render json: { comments: @comments } }\r\n    format.html\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think my question is similar to this one, but it was never answered satisfactorily: https://stackoverflow.com/q/31952173/11249670\r\n\r\nAlso, I&#39;m aware that polling may not be the best solution for near-real-time updates (I know about websockets). Since this app is just for POC, I&#39;m not worried about making too many requests to the server.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nRuby version: 2.6.3\r\nRails version: 6.0.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296826/using-data-retrieved-via-polling-in-rails-view","title":"Using data retrieved via polling in Rails view"},{"tags":["jenkins","curl","groovy","build"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4025505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f873caf041e5aad2f5b198a92af1617d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthik Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4025505/karthik-reddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570637565,"post_id":58298787,"comment_id":102978154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296825/remote-build-trigger-using-curl-post-call-in-jenkins-not-working/58298787#comment102978154_58298787"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":802,"user_id":9217817,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c0b8da87699cc74854dfcaa95301336?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user_9090","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217817/user-9090"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570604940,"creation_date":1570604940,"answer_id":58298787,"question_id":58296825,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298787","body_markdown":"See Jenkins documentation: [Parameterized Build][1]\r\n\r\nBelow is the line you are interested in:\r\n\r\n    http://server/job/myjob/buildWithParameters?token=TOKEN&amp;PARAMETER=Value\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Parameterized+Build","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296825/remote-build-trigger-using-curl-post-call-in-jenkins-not-working/58298787#58298787","title":"Remote Build trigger using CURL post call in Jenkins not working"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4025505,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f873caf041e5aad2f5b198a92af1617d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthik Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4025505/karthik-reddy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570604940,"creation_date":1570593156,"question_id":58296825,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296825","body_markdown":"**curl -v -X POST http://ci-prd.XXXX.com/jenkins/buildByToken/buildWithParameters?job=RELEASE_XXXXXX_XXXX\\&amp;token=askhdbuJHBV&amp;Type=Mexican**\r\n\r\n&gt;*Trying 10.14.6.89...\r\n\r\n&gt;* TCP_NODELAY set\r\n&gt;* Connected to ci-prd.XXXX.com (10.14.6.89) port 80 (#0)\r\n&gt;

In function `make_fnames_type()`, to substract the base address of the struct from the addresses of its various fields, you are storing the base address into an `int` variable, appropriately named `base`. But that int variable is a 32 bits quantity. You might be mutilating the pointer value.\r\n\r\nThe base address of your struct is a 64 bits quantity. You should store it only into another 64 bits type such as unsigned long int or uint64_t. The statement `base = disp[0];` is likely to be a __narrowing__ conversion and is any case not portable. You should check the sizeof values involved.\r\n\r\n__Side note:__  In C++, unlike in C you don&#39;t need to declare all function variables beforehand. You can declare variables as you need them. So for example there is no reason to _declare_ int variable `base` 10 source lines before _defining_ its value. So you can have `int base = disp[0];` all in one place, and then the narrowing mishap is much easier to detect. Even better, you can just write: `auto base = disp[0];` and then no narrowing can take place.\r\n\r\nA possibility would be to change the loop like this:\r\n\r\n        long int base = disp[0];\r\n        for (i = 0; i &lt; 8; i++) {\r\n            type[i] = MPI_CHAR;\r\n            blocklen[i] = MAXSTR;\r\n            disp[i] -= base;\r\n            /* changed %d into %ld below */\r\n            printf(&quot;disp[i] = %ld  blocklen[i] = %d\\n&quot;,\r\n                (long int)disp[i], blocklen[i]);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nYou can also check whether the memory size of the MPI custom type is what you expect thru the `MPI_Type_Size()` function.\r\n\r\n__General remark__: all MPI functions in C/C++ return an integer error code. You skip checking these error codes at your peril. It is quite possible that some MPI function has returned an error code well before the call to MPI_Bcast().\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296806/signal-segmentation-fault-11-when-using-openmpi/58305373#58305373","title":"Signal: Segmentation fault (11) when using Openmpi"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8719396,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/719185b320dc375b1fe9981f6f97c272?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MeSure","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8719396/mesure"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3755,"user_id":2309376,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BddLg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Simply Ged","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2309376/simply-ged"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570698033,"creation_date":1570593002,"last_edit_date":1570599915,"question_id":58296806,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296806","body_markdown":"I am using a CFD code, it is based on Opnempi.

It is dirty.    \r\n2. I have to create a special-name function (`reIni()`) for every class that has such symptom that live in the pool.      My pool has to recognize that function too (e.g. register using template or virtual function).    \r\n\r\nMy poor workaround 2\r\n---\r\n     struct CarJoker{\r\n        Wheel wa;\r\n        Wheel wb;\r\n        Wheel wc;\r\n        std::vector&lt;Wheel*&gt; getWheels(){  //use this instead of &quot;wheels&quot;\r\n            std::vector&lt;Wheel*&gt; re;\r\n            re.push_back(&amp;wa);\r\n            re.push_back(&amp;wb);\r\n            re.push_back(&amp;wc);\r\n            return re;\r\n        }\r\n        ....\r\n     }\r\n\r\nI would work, but I feel that it is crazy to workaround like this.    \r\nThe restriction increases pitfall for coders.     \r\n\r\nIf `wheels` happen to need to cache computation-expensive result, now it would be expensive to call `getWheels()` often.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/113c39e8bc5e93c9\r\n  [2]:

Cause:** `w3c` browser capability status\r\n\r\n**Explanation:** When `w3c:true` selenium webdriver is throwing this error. This might be because of Selenium 3 is not at fully supporting w3c implementation.\r\n\r\n**Solution1:** Simple solution would be making `w3c:false` if you don&#39;t have any dependencies based of the `w3c` capability.\r\n\r\n**Solution2:** If solution 1 doesn&#39;t work then you have to update the `selenium-webdriver-3.142.6\\lib\\selenium\\webdriver\\remote\\w3c\\commands.rb` file. check for below line and then update it.\r\n\r\n&gt; upload_file: [:post, &#39;session/:session_id/se/file&#39;]\r\n\r\nUpdating this line to  \r\n\r\n**upload_file: [:post, &#39;session/:session_id/file&#39;]** \r\n\r\n**Conclusion:** Would prefer solution 1 until Selenium 4 is rolled out. If you go with solution 2 there is possibility of test failure when you try to run them on the machine where this change is not pushed/ the file might be set back with `bundle install`. \r\n\r\nYou can use the method overright approach to go with solution but personally I feel it&#39;s too much.\r\n\r\nPosted the solution to SeleniumHQ, will submit Pull Request to SeleniumHQ once got confirmation.

One of the criteria for listing a Resource is that a Resource total is also returned in the REST API JSON response. To make my REST API Grails app do so, the `index` action of the `RestfulController` generated from my Domain objects annotated with `@Resource`, not only needs to return the Collection of resources but also a &quot;count&quot; indicating the total number of said resources. It can do so in a number of different ways, enveloping the original list of Resources with `data` and adding an extra JSON field called `count`, or it can return the said &quot;count&quot; via an HTTP header.\r\n\r\nThe obvious way for me to do this is to generate and modify the `index.gson` file for each one of my domain objects. But I will be writing a lot of duplicate code (with different GORM calls in each). The next obvious way is to specify a `superClass` attribute to the `@Resource` annotation for each of my Domain entities, and using inheritance write a base class like `RestfulControllerWithTotalInIndex` that each one of my Domain entities will subclass from. \r\n\r\nBut then I happened to look into the default implementation of `RestfulController` and found that that the `respond` call at the end of `index` already contains a model that does include a count. Specifically the code looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    def index(Integer max) {\r\n        params.max = Math.min(max ?: 10, 100)\r\n        respond listAllResources(params), model: [(&quot;${resourceName}Count&quot;.toString()): countResources()]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even with that, the default `index.gson` doesn&#39;t actually `render` this `${resourceName}Count` field. \r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m looking for is a way (maybe a configuration somewhere) with which I can expose the already mentioned `model` in the actual JSON output of my REST API, hopefully without writing a whole lot of duplicate code. And regarding the duplicate code, I was also wondering if I do need to write something, whether it&#39;s possible for me to do it only once and let multiple Domain entities re-use the same `index.gson` &quot;template&quot;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296753/grails-how-to-export-collection-total-count-from-index-gson-for-domain-entities","title":"Grails: How to export Collection total count from index.gson for Domain entities exposed as REST API through @Resource"},{"tags":["swift","firebase","openssl","cocoapods"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10555406,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AJkWD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZWDesigns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10555406/zwdesigns"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570592418,"creation_date":1570592418,"question_id":58296743,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296743","body_markdown":"When I try to run my app on my iPhone XR simulator on Xcode, an error pops up in my asn1t.h file in my BoringSSL Firebase pod folder.

I am trying simple producer and consumer but got confused why need so many properties used in Kafka. I want to implement Kafka on my project which will be used for giving string from 1 java to another java. so the 2nd java will be run the program when the message(string) coming.thank you\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296730/using-kafka-in-java","title":"Using Kafka in Java"},{"tags":["bison","flex-lexer","lex"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":9158613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fdc7af72ee7dd5897b002474701d285?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asinix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9158613/asinix"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570596090,"post_id":58297031,"comment_id":102957267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296728/format-of-lex-flex-rules-should-pattern-and-action-be-on-the-same-line/58297031#comment102957267_58297031"},{"owner":{"reputation":167810,"user_id":1566221,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce3ea4ffd1023d4382f397312352726d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rici","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566221/rici"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":171,"user_id":9158613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fdc7af72ee7dd5897b002474701d285?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asinix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9158613/asinix"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570596236,"post_id":58297031,"comment_id":102957296,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296728/format-of-lex-flex-rules-should-pattern-and-action-be-on-the-same-line/58297031#comment102957296_58297031"},{"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":9158613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fdc7af72ee7dd5897b002474701d285?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asinix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9158613/asinix"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570596320,"post_id":58297031,"comment_id":102957313,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296728/format-of-lex-flex-rules-should-pattern-and-action-be-on-the-same-line/58297031#comment102957313_58297031"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":167810,"user_id":1566221,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce3ea4ffd1023d4382f397312352726d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rici","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566221/rici"},"last_editor":{"reputation":167810,"user_id":1566221,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ce3ea4ffd1023d4382f397312352726d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rici","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1566221/rici"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570596377,"last_edit_date":1570596377,"creation_date":1570594969,"answer_id":58297031,"question_id":58296728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58297031","body_markdown":"From the [Flex manual][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; ###5.2 Format of the Rules Section\r\n&gt; The rules section of the flex input contains a series of rules of the form:\r\n\r\n&gt;     pattern   action\r\n\r\n&gt; where the pattern must be unindented and the action must begin on the same line.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the [Posix specification for lex][2], there is a similar requirement:\r\n\r\n&gt; The rules in lex source files are a table in which the left column contains regular expressions and the right column contains actions (C program fragments) to be executed when the expressions are recognized.\r\n\r\n&gt;     ERE action\r\n&gt;     ERE action...\r\n\r\n&gt; The extended regular expression (ERE) portion of a row shall be separated from action by one or more `&lt;blank&gt;` characters.\r\n\r\n`&lt;blank&gt;` is defined in the Base Definitions volume as being either a space or tab character. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPosix prohibits rule lines where there is no action, although Flex will allow them as though the action were `;`. Indented lines in the rules section are usually inserted verbatim into the output, but unless the indented lines come before the first rule, the result is undefined. At least, Posix just says that the result is undefined. Flex (and, I think, most lex implementations) copies the lines at into the generated file, where they will fall after the `break;` statement at the end of the action case clause. That won&#39;t be a problem if the lines are comments, which is not uncommon. But actual executable code is likely to trigger an &quot;unreachable code&quot; warning, assuming you compile with warnings enabled.\r\n\r\nHowever, Flex also allows start condition blocks, and inside a start condition block you&#39;re allowed to indent patterns. In that context, placing the action on a line by itself will cause Flex to treat it as a pattern rather than as inserted code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://westes.github.io/flex/manual/Rules-Section.html\r\n  [2]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/lex.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296728/format-of-lex-flex-rules-should-pattern-and-action-be-on-the-same-line/58297031#58297031","title":"Format of lex/flex rules - Should Pattern and Action be on the same line?"}],"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":9158613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fdc7af72ee7dd5897b002474701d285?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"asinix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9158613/asinix"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5639,"user_id":1000551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d8cb0eaa4de7f781e42328ec7544ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vadim Kotov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1000551/vadim-kotov"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58297031,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570697638,"creation_date":1570592258,"last_edit_date":1570697638,"question_id":58296728,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296728","body_markdown":"I did not find any explanation (or I missed it) on format of lex rules vis-a-vis actions.\r\nHere is an example:\r\n\r\n      %%\r\n      ^([ \\r\\t])*[abcd][^=].* \r\n                  {  \r\n                     return TOKEN1;\r\n                  }\r\n      %%\r\n\r\nAs opposed to:\r\n\r\n      %%\r\n      ^([ \\r\\t])*[abcd][^=].* {  \r\n                     return TOKEN1;\r\n                  }\r\n      %%\r\n\r\n\r\nI know that the %% must start on a new line without any space.

For instance, when I calculate for Ntree = 4, I need the bootstrap to use the rows for Ntree =1,2 and 3 along with Ntree = 4, without using the data for Ntree=5. \r\n\r\nBut when I apply this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(boot) \r\nlibrary(dplyr)\r\nlibrary(tidyr)\r\nlibrary(broom) \r\n\r\nAvgDEns &lt;- function(data, indices) {\r\n  data &lt;- data[indices,]\r\n  mean((35*(data$Ntree))-1)/sum((data$Xi))\r\n}\r\n\r\nbootresults2 &lt;- baseEV %&gt;%\r\n  group_by(Ntree) %&gt;%\r\n  do(tidy(boot(data = ., statistic = AvgDEns , R = 200)))\r\nbootresults2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus the resulting bootstrap only gives results taking into account when Ntree=1, or Ntree=2, or 3,etc., on their own, but I need the procedure to keep the lesser (Ntree) value rows and calculate the function with them. \r\nThe above code yields the following results\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; bootresults2\r\n# A tibble: 5 x 4\r\n# Groups:   Ntree [5]\r\n  Ntree statistic   bias std.error\r\n  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\r\n1     1     85     0          0   \r\n2     2      3.25 12.9       44.7 \r\n3     3      4.71  3.34      25.6 \r\n4     4      6.62  0.252      1.43\r\n5     5     10.2   0.298      2.01\r\n```\r\nIf we perform these calculations as we need them to be performed, the correct results should be, for instance in row 2: 3.19444, NOT 3.25 (wrong figure which results of ONLY applying singly the AvgDens function to the row for Ntree =2, disregarding Ntree=1); for 3 it should be 2.3798 (resulting of only performing AvgDens with Ntree = 3, disregarding Ntree=2, and Ntree = 1) in , NOT 4.71, and Ntreee=5 should converge to 2.12974 (AvgDens calculated with all the data in the table) with each iteration of the bootstrap.\r\n\r\nNo clue, however, how to do that; I’m very stuck.

have a generic question about Linux kernel&#39;s handling of file I/O. So far my understanding is that, in an ideal case, after process A reads a file, data is loaded into page cache, and if process B reads the same page before it is reclaimed, it does not need to hit the disk again.\r\n\r\nMy question is related to how the block device I/O works. Process A&#39;s read request will eventually be queued before the I/O actually happens. Now if device B&#39;s request (a `bio` struct) is to be inserted into the `request_queue`, *before* A&#39;s request is executed, elevator will consider whether to merge B&#39;s `bio` into any existing `request`. Now, if A and B try to read the same file offset, i.e. same device block, they are literally the same I/O, (or A and B&#39;s requests are not exactly the same but they overlap for some blocks), but so far I have not seen this case being considered in kernel code. (The only relevant thing I saw is a test on whether `bio` can be glued to an existing `request` contiguously.)\r\n\r\n*kernel 2.6.11*\r\n\r\n    inline int elv_try_merge(struct request *__rq, struct bio *bio)\r\n    {\r\n    \tint ret = ELEVATOR_NO_MERGE;\r\n    \r\n    \t/*\r\n    \t * we can merge and sequence is ok, check if it&#39;s possible\r\n    \t */\r\n    \tif (elv_rq_merge_ok(__rq, bio)) {\r\n    \t\tif (__rq-&gt;sector + __rq-&gt;nr_sectors == bio-&gt;bi_sector)\r\n    \t\t\tret = ELEVATOR_BACK_MERGE;\r\n    \t\telse if (__rq-&gt;sector - bio_sectors(bio) == bio-&gt;bi_sector)\r\n    \t\t\tret = ELEVATOR_FRONT_MERGE;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \treturn ret;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n*kernel 5.3.5*\r\n\r\n    enum elv_merge elv_merge(struct request_queue *q, struct request **req,\r\n    \t\tstruct bio *bio)\r\n    {\r\n    \tstruct elevator_queue *e = q-&gt;elevator;\r\n    \tstruct request *__rq;\r\n    \t...\r\n    \t/*\r\n    \t * See if our hash lookup can find a potential backmerge.\r\n    \t */\r\n    \t__rq = elv_rqhash_find(q, bio-&gt;bi_iter.bi_sector);\r\n    \t...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    struct request *elv_rqhash_find(struct request_queue *q, sector_t offset)\r\n    {\r\n    \tstruct elevator_queue *e = q-&gt;elevator;\r\n    \tstruct hlist_node *next;\r\n    \tstruct request *rq;\r\n    \r\n    \thash_for_each_possible_safe(e-&gt;hash, rq, next, hash, offset) {\r\n    \t\t...\r\n    \t\tif (rq_hash_key(rq) == offset)\r\n    \t\t\treturn rq;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \treturn NULL;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    #define rq_hash_key(rq)\t\t(blk_rq_pos(rq) + blk_rq_sectors(rq))\r\n\r\nDoes that mean kernel will just do two I/Os?
