The extension is not maintained by its creator, but he posted the source code on GitHub. With every new version of Visual Studio I would do my best to update the extension so it would still work (I have no other experience with Extensions).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in Visual Studio 2019, Microsoft deprecated one of the libraries that this extension depends on heavily (the Work Item Tracking). I&#39;ve been trying to follow their [migration guide][2] but it only has a couple of code samples I could use (mostly involving Queries). Most of the code that needs converting is over my head (example: WorkItemStore or WorkItemCollection).\r\n\r\nI have been able to get the project to build/compile successfully but due to the above, it has many warnings about the obsolete items (&#39;QueryItem&#39; is obsolete. For more information please see documentation at http://aka.ms/witclientom). However, there are no build errors and I can install the extension.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, the extension can be seen (and uninstalled) via the Extensions - Manage Extensions page, and information about the extension can be seen in the Help - About screen. However, the extension SHOULD add two items to the Tools menu - and most of the time, it does not. I have somehow managed to get the items to show up a couple of times, but would get an exception when trying to access them (via either the Experimental Instance of Visual Studio or the regular one). When I stopped debugging to fix the error, then uninstalled, built, and re-installed the extension, the Tools menu items are once again missing. I do not know how to get them back, nor do I understand how to figure out why they are missing - presumably due to an error, but the debug/experimental instance is not helpful here as it doesn&#39;t break or show any errors.\r\n\r\nIs there another way I can see why the Tools menu items are not showing up?\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Here is the contents of my extension&#39;s .vsct file. I checked it, and it appears that each item has its own unique ID.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;CommandTable xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/2005-10-18/CommandTable&quot; xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!--  This is the file that defines the actual layout and type of the commands.\r\n        It is divided in different sections (e.g. command definition, command\r\n        placement, ...), with each defining a specific set of properties.\r\n        See the comment before each section for more details about how to\r\n        use it. --&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!--  The VSCT compiler (the tool that translates this file into the binary \r\n        format that VisualStudio will consume) has the ability to run a preprocessor \r\n        on the vsct file; this preprocessor is (usually) the C++ preprocessor, so \r\n        it is possible to define includes and macros with the same syntax used \r\n        in C++ files. Using this ability of the compiler here, we include some files \r\n        defining some of the constants that we will use inside the file. --&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!--This is the file that defines the IDs for all the commands exposed by VisualStudio. --&gt;\r\n  &lt;Extern href=&quot;stdidcmd.h&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!--This header contains the command ids for the menus provided by the shell. --&gt;\r\n  &lt;Extern href=&quot;vsshlids.h&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;!--The Commands section is where we the commands, menus and menu groups are defined.\r\n      This section uses a Guid to identify the package that provides the command defined inside it. --&gt;\r\n  &lt;Commands package=&quot;guidTeamPilgrimPkg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- Inside this section we have different sub-sections: one for the menus, another  \r\n    for the menu groups, one for the buttons (the actual commands), one for the combos \r\n    and the last one for the bitmaps used. Each element is identified by a command id that  \r\n    is a unique pair of guid and numeric identifier; the guid part of the identifier is usually  \r\n    called &quot;command set&quot; and is used to group different command inside a logically related  \r\n    group; your package should define its own command set in order to avoid collisions  \r\n    with command ids defined by other packages. --&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!-- In this section you can define new menu groups. A menu group is a container for \r\n         other menus or buttons (commands); from a visual point of view you can see the \r\n         group as the part of a menu contained between two lines. The parent of a group \r\n         must be a menu. --&gt;\r\n    &lt;Groups&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;Group guid=&quot;guidTeamPilgrimCmdSet&quot; id=&quot;TeamPilgrimMenuGroup&quot; priority=&quot;0x0600&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Parent guid=&quot;guidSHLMainMenu&quot; id=&quot;IDM_VS_MENU_TOOLS&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Group&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Groups&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;!--Buttons section. --&gt;\r\n    &lt;!--This section defines the elements the user can interact with, like a menu command or a button \r\n        or combo box in a toolbar. --&gt;\r\n    &lt;Buttons&gt;\r\n      &lt;!--To define a menu group you have to specify its ID, the parent menu and its display priority. \r\n          The command is visible and enabled by default.

Turtles that have the same value that expression get put into the same group. The result of running this code will be something like:\r\n\r\n    {{table: [[60 (agentset, 19 turtles)] [10 (agentset, 32 turtles)] [90 (agentset, 19 turtles)] [20 (agentset, 20 turtles)] [40 (agentset, 10 turtles)]]}}\r\n    32 turtles in group 10\r\n    20 turtles in group 20\r\n    0 turtles in group 30\r\n    10 turtles in group 40\r\n    0 turtles in group 50\r\n    19 turtles in group 60\r\n    0 turtles in group 70\r\n    0 turtles in group 80\r\n    19 turtles in group 90\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it&#39;s possible to extract all the information you need from the table. It&#39;s worth familiarizing yourself with how tables work if you haven&#39;t played with them before.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know what you plan to do with this in the end, but it might be worth creating a `my-group` variable for your turtles. Supposing you have\r\n\r\n    turtles-own [ my-group ]\r\n\r\nat the top of your code, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n    foreach table:keys groups [ g -&gt;\r\n      ask table:get groups g [\r\n        set my-group table:get groups g\r\n      ]\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nwhich then makes it easy to do stuff like:\r\n\r\n    ask one-of turtles [ create-link-with one-of other my-group ]\r\n\r\nLinks, by the way, are also a good thing to familiarize yourself with if you are new to NetLogo.\r\n\r\nWhen I work with turtles that are members of groups, I often use a `groups` turtle breed to represent the group and create links between individual turtles and the group they belong to. This is especially useful if you have &quot;group level&quot; attributes that you need to keep track of. I&#39;d be happy to expand on this, but I think this is starting to be beyond the scope of this particular answer...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311905/assigning-turtles-into-groups-by-color/58319703#58319703","title":"Assigning turtles into groups by color"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12191317,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/34a902f03db7fc39cbcc69efc1f70204?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"2goblinsharks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191317/2goblinsharks"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570699724,"creation_date":1570653288,"question_id":58311905,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311905","body_markdown":"New to Netlogo, Stackoverflow, and programming in general.

your map into multiple maps, each of which can be locked independently, is a good and practical approach.   The key to doing this efficiently is to remember that, while you may have 10s of thousands of entries in your map, you probably don&#39;t have that many threads or that many cores.\r\n\r\nIf your machine has, say 8 cores, then hashing your keys into 64 different buckets, each with its own map and mutex, will ensure that contention is unlikely and won&#39;t significantly slow down the application.\r\n\r\nAt most 8 cores could be trying to insert at the same time, and even if they were doing that constantly, they&#39;d only be blocked 12% of the time.  Your threads will probably have lots of other things to do, though, so real contention would be much less than that.\r\n\r\nAs @Eric indicates, the magic Google words for this are &quot;lock striping&quot;.\r\n\r\nRegarding false sharing of adjacent mutexes: `std::map` insertions aren&#39;t fast enough for that to be a real problem.\r\n\r\nOne thing you might have to worry about is contention in the memory allocator that is used to allocate map nodes.  They all come from the same heap, after all.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311902/fine-grained-locks-on-c-map-of-maps/58314607#58314607","title":"Fine-grained locks on C++ map of maps"}],"owner":{"reputation":319,"user_id":4438651,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19c65aec0e9e4476777f960719df3473?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kulluk007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4438651/kulluk007"},"last_editor":{"reputation":319,"user_id":4438651,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19c65aec0e9e4476777f960719df3473?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kulluk007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4438651/kulluk007"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58314607,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570679954,"creation_date":1570653280,"last_edit_date":1570653982,"question_id":58311902,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311902","body_markdown":"I have a C++17 application that has multiple threads concurrently writing to a map of maps:\r\n\r\n    // global shared variable across threads\r\n    std::map&lt;int, std::map&lt;int, int&gt;&gt; the_map;\r\n\r\n    // many threads inserting different values for varying i and j\r\n    auto val = somewhat_expensive_f()\r\n    the_map[i][j] = val;\r\n\r\nFor this application, there are tens of thousands of unique (i,j) pairs and on the order of 2,000 map in the_map upon completion. I&#39;m experimenting with running multiple threads running expensive computations that insert into this map of maps. Right now I&#39;m using a `std::map` which doesn&#39;t allow concurrent insertions.\r\n\r\nI wrapped the insertions with a `std::lock_guard&lt;std::mutex&gt;` as a first cut, and of course that really slowed down the application and hamstrung the concurrency. My instinct is that I can either use some concurrent map of maps or fine-grained locking. \r\n\r\nFor the second approach, my instinct is to do some sort of array of locks that are indexed into using a hash of the (i,j) tuple. For example, `lock_guard&lt;mutex&gt;(array_of_locks[hash((i&lt;&lt;32)|j) % array_sz])` could allow multiple locks to be shared across the thousands of sub-maps.\r\n\r\n**Question 1:** Am I on the right track? Any feedback on this approach?\r\n\r\n**Question 2:** With this approach, one concern I have is false sharing of adjacent mutexes in the array. I could pad them out to fill an entire cache line. Are there better approaches? \r\n\r\nAnother approach I could consider is to do some sort of inserting into thread-local maps and then combine them later in a master thread.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311902/fine-grained-locks-on-c-map-of-maps","title":"Fine-grained locks on C++ map of maps"},{"tags":["arrays","python-3.x","dictionary","matplotlib"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1374,"user_id":10640534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25583304ddb01032ed802cbd87b17d53?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Patol75","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10640534/patol75"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570674505,"creation_date":1570674505,"answer_id":58314612,"question_id":58311900,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58314612","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s first focus on your dictionary. Each key is associated with a list, that can contain up to two elements. When you execute the following piece of code,\r\n\r\n    dictionary = {\r\n        &#39;Product Name 1&#39; : [10.99,20.99],\r\n        &#39;Product Name 2&#39; : [50.99,10.99],\r\n        &#39;Product Name 3&#39; : [40.00,15.99],\r\n        &#39;Product Name 4&#39; : [50.00],\r\n        &#39;Product Name 5&#39; : [50.00]\r\n    }\r\n    print(dictionary.values())\r\n    # dict_values([[10.99, 20.99], [50.99, 10.99], [40.0, 15.99], [50.0], [50.0]])\r\n\r\nyou can see the output takes the shape of a list of sub-lists, each sub-list containing the values associated with a specific key. However, not all lists have the same length. This is a problem as you want to convert your list to a numpy array. Indeed, you cannot generate an array with inconsistent dimensions. As a result, you get an array of dtype `object` that is just storing the sub-lists as before.\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    print(np.array([x for x in dictionary.values()]))\r\n    print(np.array([x for x in dictionary.values()]).dtype)\r\n    # [list([10.99, 20.99]) list([50.99, 10.99]) list([40.0, 15.99])\r\n    #  list([50.0]) list([50.0])]\r\n    # object\r\n\r\nThis is why you get an IndexError when you try to slice your numpy array, because you simply cannot. I propose a solution below. The keys and values are gathered using list comprehensions. Two bar plots are produced, one for each potential entry in your original dictionary lists. For each bar plot, the height of the bars is determined using a list comprehension. The first one simply fetches the first item of the list. The second one fetches the second item if it exists, otherwise, it uses 0.

There is no way to stop this. \r\n\r\n@hardillb suggests that if the connection has gone down but not been noticed by the broker, then you have up to keepalive*1.5 to reconnect before the LWT is sent. This is correct. However, and this is a big however, you&#39;re relying on your loss of connection not being recognised at the broker. It might work sometimes, but it&#39;s not a condition I&#39;d want to rely on.\r\n\r\nIf this feature is very important for you, then you probably should look at using MQTT v5 instead.

However, if the client drops and then immediately reconnects, I want to suppress the message.\r\n\r\nAs the client unique ID is the same, I would&#39;ve thought this would be standard behaviour; but apparently not.\r\n\r\nSo, the client drops, and reconnects. I get the startup messages the client sends, and *then* I get the Last Will &quot;client has died&quot; message. This is not helpful, as it looks like the client has died again and failed to reconnect.\r\n\r\nHow can I suppress Last Will messages for clients that successfully reconnect before the timeout occurs?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here is some simplified code that demonstrates the problem:\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;ESP8266WiFi.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;PubSubClient.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;EspMQTTClient.h&gt;\r\n#include &quot;lwip/inet.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;lwip/dns.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;mqtt.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;secret.h&quot;\r\n\r\n#define SERVICE_NAME \t&quot;pc-control&quot;\r\n\r\nEspMQTTClient mqtt(SSID, PASSWORD, MQTT_SERVER, (String(SERVICE_NAME) + &quot;/Example&quot;).c_str());;\r\n\r\nvoid onConnectionEstablished() {\r\n\tmqtt.publish(&quot;Example&quot;, &quot;ready&quot;);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid setup() {\r\n\tmqtt.enableLastWillMessage(&quot;Example&quot;, &quot;dead&quot;, true);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid loop() {\r\n\tmqtt.loop();\r\n\tdelay(100);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem seems to be related to the `String(SERVICE_NAME) + &quot;/Example&quot;` bit. I considered that perhaps it was creating a dangling pointer; but were that to be the cause, I would expect the LWT to occur even before the client lost connection.\r\n\r\nI am running &quot;mosquitto MQTT v3.1 message broker&quot;, and the subscriber looks like this:\r\n```\r\nmosquitto_sub -t &quot;#&quot; -v\r\nExample ready\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;I reset the client here&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\nExample ready\r\nExample dead\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311874/how-to-suppress-mqtt-last-will-message-if-client-reconnects","title":"How to suppress MQTT Last Will message if client reconnects?"},{"tags":["php","events","lumen"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":196,"user_id":8415116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/982821e593420b7bdd8aa76f9ad5c1ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"janedoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8415116/janedoe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":196,"user_id":8415116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/982821e593420b7bdd8aa76f9ad5c1ef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"janedoe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8415116/janedoe"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570735878,"last_edit_date":1570735878,"creation_date":1570734326,"answer_id":58329568,"question_id":58311872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58329568","body_markdown":"Well, my problem seems to be that I defined the boot method in `EventServiceProvider` without calling `parent::boot()`.

in mind :*  \r\nThis is my first question on StackOverflow.  \r\nThe web app is a software package that the company modified for their needs.  \r\nThe part on is using Virtual Print Engine from IDEAL Software (VPE).    \r\nValues were modified for this post   \r\n\r\n**Issue**   \r\nThe main issue is that VPE uses ActiveX Control and we&#39;re trying to ditch Internet Explorer.\r\nThe process is to create PDF the size of the stickers they use for shipping.\r\n\r\n*Try to stay with me while I try to explain how the generatePDF.asp is called :*\r\n\r\n - The user click on a button in the page report_up.asp which post a request to report_pr.asp\r\n - report_pr.asp then process the post and calls report.asp\r\n - generatePDF.asp generates the PDF, sends it straight to the selected printer\r\n\r\nSo the whole process is hidden from the dev tool from the browser (except on IE)\r\n\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a sample of the original code. As you might notice, I also juggle with VBScript.\r\n**Edited to add more code**\r\n```\r\n\r\n        &lt;%@ LANGUAGE=VBSCRIPT %&gt;\r\n    &lt;%Option Explicit%&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- #Include virtual=&quot;\\SOFTinit.asp&quot;

am currently working on one reactjs web application. The architect has already setup React-Redux in the application. Now as a developer me and my teammate, we are working on the different areas of the application. So there are certain guidelines that the Architect has given to us: \r\n\r\n 1. Our merge requests should be independent of each other. Meaning, we will keep creating merge requests and he will merge it in any order. He will not follow the merge request sequence. I find it strange. \r\n 2. Secondly, he wants us to create react components without using internal state(mostly functional/stupid components). We are kind of prohibited (exceptionally, somewhere he may allow) to do `this.state = {}` in a component if it would be a stateful one. Mostly we need to strict to the fact that we can have mostly functional components but not the stateful component and there will be only one store that is a redux store. Other than that no internal state. One app with only one state. \r\n \r\nI do not understand these rules. I mean \r\n1 - If our code will not go on dev branch properly (sequentially to be precise) so how can we share our code amongst each other and do progress? \r\n2 - If we listen to him and accept the principle that one app can have only one state no other internal state then, what other people teach in tutorials (online, in articles) is that wrong ? \r\n\r\nI am bit confuse.

For the sake of not making the lives of my consumers any harder, I&#39;m not strictly enforcing this during deserialization, but I want to ensure the serialized JSON produced by my library conforms as specified. I am using Java and [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) ObjectMapper to serialize Objects into JSON. My understanding from writing a custom serializer is that the Object is at one point represented as JsonNode, regardless of what you are converting to.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is intercept the JsonNode as it exits the serializer, make some adjustments to it (find and remove empty arrays and objects), and then let it continue on its way. I need to do this in an environment where I can&#39;t tweak the ObjectMapper, because I don&#39;t have access to it. And further, the complex hierarchy of models in this library use Jackson&#39;s default serialization with annotations etc. heavily, and I cannot eliminate this. \r\n\r\nIf I go the route of defining a custom serializer for the base type, let&#39;s say &quot;Resource&quot;, then I have a problem, because I still need the original serializer&#39;s output in order to generate my modified output. And further, that needs to accommodate any custom serializers that may already exist on various types within the model. \r\n\r\nI got pretty far with the above option using https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-call-default-serializer-from-custom-serializer and the last option, implementing BeanSerializerModifier, but I ran into the issue where I can&#39;t control the ObjectMapper that my library consumers use. \r\n\r\nExample POJOs (Using Lombok for accessors):\r\n```java\r\n@Data\r\n@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)\r\n@JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\r\nabstract class Resource {\r\n  private FhirString id;\r\n  private List&lt;Extension&gt; extension;\r\n\r\n  @JsonProperty(access = JsonProperty.Access.READ_ONLY)\r\n  public abstract ResourceType getResourceType();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Data\r\n@Builder\r\nclass SomethingElse extends Resource {\r\n  FhirUri someProperty;\r\n  CodeableConcept someCode;\r\n  List&lt;Reference&gt; someReferences;\r\n\r\n  @Override\r\n  public ResourceType getResourceType() {\r\n    return ResourceType.SOMETHING_ELSE;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd an example instance of the SomethingElse class:\r\n```java\r\nSomethingElse somethingElse = SomethingElse.builder()\r\n    .someProperty(FhirUri.from(&quot;some-simple-uri&quot;))\r\n    .someCode(new CodeableConcept())\r\n    .someReference(List.of(new Reference()))\r\n    .build();\r\nsomethingElse.setId(FhirString.randomUuid());\r\nsomethingElse.setExtension(new ArrayList&lt;&gt;());\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I tell any mapper (or, for example, use a Spring service) to map the SomethingElse class into JsonNode, I can, for example, end up with empty objects and arrays, like this:\r\n```java\r\nObjectMapper mapper = getUntouchableMapper();\r\nJsonNode somethingElseNode = mapper.valueToTree(somethingElse);\r\nSystem.out.println(somethingElseNode.toString());\r\n```\r\nBecomes:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;SomethingElse&quot;,\r\n  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0002-0004-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n  &quot;someProperty&quot;: &quot;some-simple-uri&quot;,\r\n  &quot;someCode&quot;: {},\r\n  &quot;someReferences&quot;: [{}],\r\n  &quot;extension&quot;: []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to FHIR, this should actually look like: \r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  &quot;resourceType&quot;: &quot;SomethingElse&quot;,\r\n  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0002-0004-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n  &quot;someProperty&quot;: &quot;some-simple-uri&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To summarize**\r\n\r\nHow do I preserve the serialization mechanisms already in place, regardless of the ObjectMapper used, and somehow remove empty lists and objects from outgoing JSON produced by the Jackson serialization process? \r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\nI also tried `@JsonInclude(JsonInclude.Include.NON_EMPTY)`, which did omit empty list implementations. However, the vast majority of data in this library is represented by POJOs that serialize to maps and primitives, and this annotation only works if they are represented directly by maps and primitives in the model.

Only the instance of `context` knowns what has been changed and can generate the sql insert/update/delete statements. To make sure that different contexts (or even when you use only one context) will made database changes atomic you can use `TransactionScope` to make sure either all changes are written to the database or nothing happens at all. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void DoWork ()\r\n{\r\n    // make sure you have MSDTC configured otherwise the TransactionScope will not work.\r\n    using (var scope = new TransactionScope ()) \r\n    {\r\n        Action1 ();\r\n        Action2 ();\r\n\r\n        // This will persist it to the database - COMMIT\r\n        scope.Complete (); \r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void Action1 ()\r\n{\r\n    using (var context = new DbContext ()) \r\n    {\r\n        // Do some work...\r\n\r\n        context.SaveChanges ();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic void Action2 ()\r\n{\r\n    using (var otherContext = new DbContext ()) \r\n    {\r\n        // Do some work...\r\n\r\n        otherContext.SaveChanges ();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311801/microsoft-entity-framework-list-property-on-model-is-not-updated-in-database-af/58312379#58312379","title":"Microsoft Entity Framework: List property on Model is not updated in database after adding data and saving"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12191278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0019ce7a8f3ede855194e3061c3e0f95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TuTapes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191278/tutapes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12191278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0019ce7a8f3ede855194e3061c3e0f95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TuTapes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191278/tutapes"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58312379,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570705778,"creation_date":1570652842,"last_edit_date":1570656916,"question_id":58311801,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311801","body_markdown":"Been stuck on this longer than I&#39;d like to admit.

Note that this is no different from multiple threads running a method on the same non-singleton object instance.\r\n\r\n&gt; how will different threads share the same instance or chunk of memory that represents the object?\r\n\r\n(Ignoring NUMA and processor caches), the object exists in only one place in memory (hence, it&#39;s a singleton) so the different threads are all reading from the same memory addresses.\r\n\r\nNow, if the object is immutable (and doesn&#39;t have external side-effects, like IO) then that&#39;s okay: multiple threads reading from the same memory and never changing it doesn&#39;t introduce any problems.\r\n\r\nBy analogy, this is like having a single (single-sided) piece of paper on a desk and 10 people reading it simultaneously: no problem.\r\n\r\nIf the object is mutable or (does have external side-effects like IO) then that&#39;s a problem :) You need to synchronize each thread&#39;s changes otherwise they&#39;ll be overwriting each other - this is bad.\r\n\r\nNote that in many languages and platforms, like C#/.NET and C++, documentation can often assert or claim that a method is &quot;thread-safe&quot; but this is not necessarily absolutely guaranteed by the runtime (excepting the case where a function is provably &quot;`const`-correct&quot; and has no IO, which is something C++ can do, but C# cannot currently do that).\r\n\r\nNote that just because a single method is thread-safe, doesn&#39;t mean an entire logical operation (e.g. calling multiple object methods in sequence) is thread-safe; for example, consider an `Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;`: many threads can simultaneously call `TryGetValue` without issues - but as soon as one thread calls `.Add` then that messes up all of the other threads calling `TryGetValue` (because `Dictionary&lt;K,V&gt;` does not guarantee that `.Add` is atomic and blocks `TryGetValue`, this is why we use `ConcurrentDictionary` which has a different API - or we wrap our logical business/domain operations in `lock` (`Monitor`) statements).\r\n\r\n&gt; Will different threads somehow &quot;copy&quot; the single-instance object method code to be run on its own CPU resources?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nYou can make that happen with `[ThreadLocal]` and `[ThreadStatic]` (and `[AsyncLocal]`) but proponents of functional programming techniques (like myself) will strongly recommend against this for many reasons. If you want a thread to &quot;own&quot; something then pass the object on the stack as a parameter and not inside hidden static state.\r\n\r\n(Also note this does not apply to value-types (e.g. `struct`) which are always copied between uses, but I assume you&#39;re referring to `class` object instances, fwiw - as .NET discourages using mutable structs anyway).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311800/can-a-singleton-object-have-a-thread-safe-method-executing-in-different-thread/58312075#58312075","title":"Can a singleton object have a (thread-safe) method executing in different threads simultaneously?"}],"owner":{"reputation":309,"user_id":1287091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsQum.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reed Sandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1287091/reed-sandberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":309,"user_id":1287091,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tsQum.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reed Sandberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1287091/reed-sandberg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570731542,"creation_date":1570652840,"last_edit_date":1570731542,"question_id":58311800,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311800","body_markdown":"If so, how will different threads share the same instance or chunk of memory that represents the object?

This question is specifically for multiple active threads that are executing each on a different processor.

Maybe someone knows how to solve this problem?\r\n\r\nThanks indeed.\r\n\r\n![Connect issue][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8tOT7.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311798/xcode-11-cant-launch-carplay-audio-application","title":"Xcode 11 can&#39;t launch CarPlay audio application"},{"tags":["python","pandas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":169,"user_id":8968696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7738287311c430de36dea9b0878b6d99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hkr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8968696/hkr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570653248,"post_id":58311796,"comment_id":102984897,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311796/convert-dataframe-of-floats-to-integers-in-pandas#comment102984897_58311796"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3955,"user_id":6573902,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nplar.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sophros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6573902/sophros"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3955,"user_id":6573902,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nplar.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sophros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6573902/sophros"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570653874,"last_edit_date":1570653874,"creation_date":1570653318,"answer_id":58311912,"question_id":58311796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311912","body_markdown":"You can use `apply` for this purpose:\r\n\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;A&#39;:np.arange(1.0, 20.0), &#39;B&#39;:np.arange(101.0, 120.0)})\r\n    print(df)\r\n           A      B\r\n    0    1.0  101.0\r\n    1    2.0  102.0\r\n    2    3.0  103.0\r\n    3    4.0  104.0\r\n    4    5.0  105.0\r\n    5    6.0  106.0\r\n    6    7.0  107.0\r\n    7    8.0  108.0\r\n    8    9.0  109.0\r\n    9   10.0  110.0\r\n    10  11.0  111.0\r\n    11  12.0  112.0\r\n    12  13.0  113.0\r\n    13  14.0  114.0\r\n    14  15.0  115.0\r\n    15  16.0  116.0\r\n    16  17.0  117.0\r\n    17  18.0  118.0\r\n    18  19.0  119.0\r\n    \r\n    df2 = df.apply(lambda a: [int(b) for b in a])\r\n    print(df2)\r\n    \r\n         A    B\r\n    0    1  101\r\n    1    2  102\r\n    2    3  103\r\n    3    4  104\r\n    4    5  105\r\n    5    6  106\r\n    6    7  107\r\n    7    8  108\r\n    8    9  109\r\n    9   10  110\r\n    10  11  111\r\n    11  12  112\r\n    12  13  113\r\n    13  14  114\r\n    14  15  115\r\n    15  16  116\r\n    16  17  117\r\n    17  18  118\r\n    18  19  119\r\n\r\n\r\nA better approach is to change the type at the level of series:\r\n\r\n    for col in df.columns:\r\n        if df[col].dtype == np.float64:\r\n            df[col] = df[col].astype(&#39;int&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    print(df)\r\n    \r\n         A    B\r\n    0    1  101\r\n    1    2  102\r\n    2    3  103\r\n    3    4  104\r\n    4    5  105\r\n    5    6  106\r\n    6    7  107\r\n    7    8  108\r\n    8    9  109\r\n    9   10  110\r\n    10  11  111\r\n    11  12  112\r\n    12  13  113\r\n    13  14  114\r\n    14  15  115\r\n    15  16  116\r\n    16  17  117\r\n    17  18  118\r\n    18  19  119\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311796/convert-dataframe-of-floats-to-integers-in-pandas/58311912#58311912","title":"Convert dataframe of floats to integers in pandas?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":38342,"user_id":2535611,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d61593cac94336661b986823abb9852e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rafaelc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2535611/rafaelc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":38342,"user_id":2535611,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d61593cac94336661b986823abb9852e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rafaelc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2535611/rafaelc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570653866,"last_edit_date":1570653866,"creation_date":1570653501,"answer_id":58311957,"question_id":58311796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311957","body_markdown":"If you have a data frame of ints, simply use `astype` directly. \r\n\r\n    df.astype(int)\r\n\r\nIf not, use `select_dtypes` first to select numeric columns.\r\n\r\n    df.select_dtypes(np.number).astype(int)\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({&#39;col1&#39;: [1.,2.,3.,4.], &#39;col2&#39;: [10.,20.,30.,40.]})\r\n\r\n&lt;/&gt;\r\n\r\n       col1  col2\r\n    0   1.0  10.0\r\n    1   2.0  20.0\r\n    2   3.0  30.0\r\n    3   4.0  40.0\r\n\r\n&lt;/&gt;\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;

But there is exists also many differences between APIs structures.\r\n\r\n1. One of them is to send response like this (this is the only one example of response):\r\n\r\n        return response()-&gt;json([\r\n            &#39;success&#39; =&gt; true, // true or false\r\n            &#39;message&#39; =&gt; &quot;Message about success!&quot;,\r\n        ], 200); // 200, 401, 403, 404, 409, etc\r\n\r\n2. The other approach is to always sending 200 OK, but message can be also about error:\r\n\r\n        return response()-&gt;json([\r\n            &#39;success&#39; =&gt; false, // true or false\r\n            &#39;code&#39; =&gt; 404,\r\n            &#39;message&#39; =&gt; &quot;Resource not found!&quot;,\r\n        ], 200);\r\n\r\nThis kind of methods will written under try{}catch() and will return only 200, but that messages can imitated also as an error (as in example).\r\n\r\n3. The other *(appropriate approach for you)* is to change your Frontend AJAX functionality like this:\r\n\r\n        $.ajax({\r\n            type: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n            url: processUrl,\r\n            data: {\r\n                {{--_token: &quot;{{ csrf_token() }}&quot;,--}}\r\n                name: fname,\r\n                surname: lname\r\n            },\r\n            dataType: &#39;json&#39;\r\n        }).done(function(res) {\r\n            console.log(res);\r\n            if(res.length &gt;= 1) {\r\n                $(&#39;#display&#39;).val(res.name);\r\n            }\r\n        }).fail(function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) {\r\n            console.log(&quot;Error: &quot; + textStatus);\r\n        });\r\n\r\nAJAX .done() function replaces method .success() which was deprecated in jQuery 1.8. This is an alternative construct for the success callback function (like before: &quot;success: function(){...}&quot;).\r\n\r\nAJAX .fail() function replaces method .error() which was deprecated in jQuery 1.8. This is an alternative construct for the complete callback function (like before: &quot;error: function(){...}&quot;).\r\n\r\nNote: .error() callback is called on HTTP errors, but also if JSON parsing on the response fails. This is what&#39;s probably happening if response code is 200/201 but you still are thrown to error callback.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311781/ajax-call-back-and-laravel/58312759#58312759","title":"Ajax Call Back and Laravel"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1179,"user_id":9272040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYjVg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Udo E.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9272040/udo-e"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1179,"user_id":9272040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rYjVg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Udo E.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9272040/udo-e"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570659097,"last_edit_date":1570659097,"creation_date":1570658089,"answer_id":58312811,"question_id":58311781,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312811","body_markdown":"Due to the asynchronous nature of Ajax calls, **do not** put them in the normal execution flow of your program.

I.e. `year % 100 == 0` is true.\r\n\r\nException: When that is also divisible by 400, i.e. `year % 400 == 0` is true - then we have a leap year.\r\n\r\nBasically: divisible by four yields a candidate - you then have to study it further to make a final decision.\r\n\r\n# Decision tree\r\n1. Is it a leap year candidate? `year % 4 == 0` Otherwise: Display &quot;not a leap year&quot;\r\n2. Is it a leap year exception (every 100 years)? `year % 100 == 0` Otherwise: Display &quot;not a leap year&quot;\r\n3. Is it a leap year exception exception (every 400 years)? `year % 400 == 0` True =&gt; Display &quot;leap year&quot;, False =&gt; Display &quot;not a leap year&quot;\r\n\r\n# Your implementation\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s first look at your `if` statement.\r\n\r\n1. Your first if statement checks whether the year is divisible by four. This is so that you know whether you deal with a leap year candidate. So this is correct - *but* you forgot to deal with the case, when the year is NOT a leap year (so here you miss a possible &quot;is not a leap year&quot; output)\r\n\r\n2. Now it gets a bit confusing. You check whether the year is NOT divisible by 100. If a leap year candidate is NOT divisible by 100 it IS a leap year. So you can output success, but you have to deal with the &quot;else&quot; case.\r\n\r\n3. The third if is nested in the wrong if block. It belongs into the else block of the parent.\r\n\r\n# Hints\r\n\r\nTry to get an understanding on how the input and the output relate to each other and try to hit every if / else.\r\n\r\nWhenever you write an if think about whether you need the corresponding else block.\r\n\r\nIf things get weird, try to &quot;trace&quot; your program with &quot;breadcrumb outputs&quot;: System.out.println(&quot;1&quot;); System.out.println(&quot;2&quot;); ... on every line where you deal with branching or looping (if,else,switch,while...) this will trace every step the program does on the command line. You can use this until your school encourages you to use a proper IDE.\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget: Practice makes perfect ;)\r\n\r\n# Pseude code (spoiler)\r\n\r\nOnly use this if you&#39;re completely stuck.\r\n\r\n&gt;!`if (year % 4 == 0) {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`   // this might be a leap year - we need to dig further`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`   if (year % 100 == 0) {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`      if (year % 400 == 0) {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`         print &quot;leap year&quot;`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`      } else {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`         print &quot;not a leap year&quot;`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`      }`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`   } else {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`      print &quot;leap year&quot;`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`   }`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`} else {`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`   print &quot;not a leap year&quot;`\r\n&gt;!\r\n&gt;!`}`\r\n&gt;!\r\n\r\n# Bottom line\r\nSome of your logic is incorrect and you forget to implement the `else` branches.\r\n\r\nHTH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311779/else-statement-not-printing-line/58312320#58312320","title":"Else statement not printing line?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12191272,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC-9HkJnhoEN6TJH3v_LnpUDDdnqh_TJYayYidY=k-s128","display_name":"TrashcoderNGL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191272/trashcoderngl"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2622,"user_id":356629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f563718f19b5aab648973d6e38a9d8af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kenny_k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/356629/kenny-k"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58312320,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570655225,"creation_date":1570652694,"last_edit_date":1570653169,"question_id":58311779,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311779","body_markdown":"I wrote a simple program that is supposed to display whether if a user inputted int is a leap year or not, and if so what leap year is it.\r\n\r\nDuring running of the program whenever a number that was not supposed to be a leap year was inputted it did not print the else statement.\r\n\r\nNote: This was written in the IDE BlueJ so io was automatically imported hence why I did not import it\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-java --&gt;\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Reads a user inputted integer value and determines if it is a leap year\r\n     * Created by Oh boy I suck at this\r\n     * 9 September 2019\r\n     */\r\n\r\n    import java.util.Scanner;\r\n\r\n    public class LeapYear\r\n    {\r\n        public static int getYear(String prompt)\r\n        {\r\n            String newLine = System.getProperty(&quot;line.separator&quot;);\r\n            int value = 0;\r\n            boolean flag = true;\r\n            while (flag)\r\n            {\r\n                Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n                System.out.println(prompt + &quot;: &quot;);\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    value = scan.nextInt();\r\n                    flag = false;\r\n                }\r\n                catch(java.util.InputMismatchException e)\r\n                {\r\n                    System.out.println(&quot;What you have inputed was not an int.&quot;);\r\n                    System.out.println(newLine);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            return value;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public static void main (String[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            int year = getYear(&quot;Input the year &quot;);\r\n            final int leapYear = year/4;\r\n            if(year % 4 == 0){\r\n                if(year % 100 &gt;= 1){\r\n                    if(year % 400 &gt;= 1){\r\n                        System.out.println(&quot;The year inputted: &quot;

You have:\r\n\r\n\r\n    def _model(M, **args):\r\n        x, y = M\r\n        arr = model(x, y, params)\r\n        return arr\r\n\r\n\r\n    def model(x, y, *args):\r\n        return a1+a2*y+a3*np.power(y,2)+a4*np.power(y,3)+\\\r\n        (b1+b2*y+b3*np.power(y,2)+b4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,2)+\\\r\n        (c1+c2*y+c3*np.power(y,2)+c4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,4)+\\\r\n        (d1+d2*y+d3*np.power(y,2)+d4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,6)\r\n\r\n\r\n    model = Model(_model)\r\n\r\nWhich has a few problems: \r\n\r\n1. `args` is not used in `_model`, and `params` is not defined in the function so will be module-level.  \r\n2. Similarly in `model`, `args` is not used and `a1`, `a2`, etc will be taken from the module-level (programming) variables and (importantly!!) these will not be updated in the fit.  \r\n \r\nIn short, your model function never sees varying values for the parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n`lmfit.Model` takes the **named function arguments** and turns those into parameter names.  It does not turn `**kws` or `*position_args` into parameter names. So I think that what you want to do is write a model function like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    def model(x, y, a1, a2, a2, a4, b1, b2, b3 ,b3, c1, c2, c3, c4,\r\n              d1, d2, d3, d4):\r\n        return a1+a2*y+a3*np.power(y,2)+a4*np.power(y,3)+\\\r\n        (b1+b2*y+b3*np.power(y,2)+b4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,2)+\\\r\n        (c1+c2*y+c3*np.power(y,2)+c4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,4)+\\\r\n        (d1+d2*y+d3*np.power(y,2)+d4*np.power(y,3))/np.power(x,6)\r\n\r\nThen create a model from that with:\r\n\r\n    # Note: don&#39;t give a function and Model instance the same name!!\r\n    my_model = Model(model, independent_vars=(&#39;x&#39;, &#39;y&#39;))  \r\n\r\n\r\nWith that model defined you can run the fit, and without having to unravel your data (the independent data in `lmfit` can be of almost any data type, and data arrays can be multi-dimensional):\r\n\r\n    result = my_model.fit(Z, params, x=X, y=Y)\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, making such changes works for me in the sense that the fit runs to completion.  The fit still gets stuck with some of the parameters not updating from their initial values, but that is sort of a separate question from the mechanics of setting up and running the fit, and is probably due to polynomials being pretty unstable or poor initial estimates. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs an aside: `np.power(y,n)` can be spelled `y**n` and readability counts.  Also, numerical stability is sometimes improved with replaced \r\n\r\n    a + b*x + c*x**2 + d*x**3\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n    a + x*(b + x*(c + x*d)) \r\n\r\nThough I do not know if that would help in your case.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311764/covariance-matrix-is-nonetype-in-lmfit-python3-6/58349424#58349424","title":"Covariance matrix is NoneType in lmfit Python3-6"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12191020,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/376cf3f4d4d02769542f6b126743d481?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Radek D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191020/radek-d"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12191020,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/376cf3f4d4d02769542f6b126743d481?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Radek D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12191020/radek-d"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58349424,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570835491,"creation_date":1570652634,"last_edit_date":1570786343,"question_id":58311764,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311764","body_markdown":"I want to fit a f(x,y) function using lmfit.

This behavior is indeed intended (viewDidLoad is called once the screen is loaded). You can solve this problem in several ways. An easy one would be to introduce a singleton service (a service which is shared across the app) which holds the state of the controller, so every time the controller is created it will ask the service for its state. Keep in mind this is not a very good solution, but it should be sufficient as starting point.

The chat service would then store the messages via the database layer in some persistent store like user defaults, realm or core data for each chat.

Here I call a function fetchChatMessages() in viewdidload() that essentially fetches the conversation from firestore. Problem is, whenever I go to the previous controller and open the chat again, it again fetches the messages. \r\n\r\nNot sure if it&#39;s fetching from cache or from the server itself. But I did write a print statement under the firestore fetch code that prints every time.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m new to swift so my question is, in other chat apps, you can see that messages seemed to be fetched just once from the server and after that you add a listener and update the collection view to display the new messages. In my case, it seems like everything is fetched over and over again. Even though I have added a listener and followed a highly acclaimed tutorial.\r\n\r\nAlso, I added a scroll to bottom code whenever messages are fetched, so every time a new message is fetched, the controller automatically scrolls to the bottom. But this happens every time I open the chat. I was trying to fix this bug where the controller keeps scrolling every time the view appears which made me wonder, am I contacting firebase again and again when the controller is opened?\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n        \r\n        fetchCurrentUser()\r\n        fetchMessages()\r\n        setupLoadView()\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n//MARK: Fetch Messages\r\n    \r\n    var listener: ListenerRegistration?\r\n    \r\n    fileprivate func fetchMessages(){\r\n        print(&quot;Fetching Messages&quot;)\r\n        guard let cUid = Auth.auth().currentUser?.uid else {return}\r\n        \r\n        let query = Firestore.firestore().collection(&quot;matches&quot;).document(cUid).collection(connect.uid).order(by: &quot;Timestamp&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        listener = query.addSnapshotListener { (querySnapshot, error) in\r\n            if let error = error{\r\n                print(&quot;There was an error fetching messages&quot;, error.localizedDescription)\r\n                return\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            querySnapshot?.documentChanges.forEach({ (change) in\r\n                if change.type == .added{\r\n                    let dictionary = change.document.data()\r\n                    self.items.append(.init(dictionary: dictionary))\r\n                    print(&quot;FIRESTORE HAS BEEN CONTACTED FETCHING MESSAGES&quot;)\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n            \r\n            self.collectionView.reloadData()\r\n            self.collectionView.scrollToItem(at: [0, self.items.count - 1], at: .bottom, animated: true)\r\n            print(&quot;Fetched messages&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //MARK: View Disappears\r\n    \r\n    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {\r\n        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)\r\n        \r\n        if isMovingFromParent{\r\n            listener?.remove()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n\r\nI want the controller to remember its state.

How to get the right size of 1109x844 pixels?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311738/getwindowrect-gives-an-unexpected-answer-if-window-fonts-are-set-to-125","title":"GetWindowRect gives an unexpected answer if window fonts are set to 125%"},{"tags":["r","list","function","loops","dataframe"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570735564,"post_id":58311783,"comment_id":103017672,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311736/follow-up-separate-columns-with-constant-numbers-and-condense-them-to-one-row-i/58311783#comment103017672_58311783"},{"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570735634,"post_id":58311783,"comment_id":103017698,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311736/follow-up-separate-columns-with-constant-numbers-and-condense-them-to-one-row-i/58311783#comment103017698_58311783"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"last_editor":{"reputation":478505,"user_id":3732271,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ee6e12042dc31b1ef27471482f9ff91f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"akrun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3732271/akrun"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570653810,"last_edit_date":1570653810,"creation_date":1570652709,"answer_id":58311783,"question_id":58311736,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311783","body_markdown":"Assuming that the `NA` rows should be preserved, apply `duplicated` by looping over the `list` as well as if all the elements of a particular are `NA`, then keep that row\r\n\r\n    lapply(L, function(x)  x[(rowSums(is.na(x)) == ncol(x))|!duplicated(x),])\r\n    #$A\r\n    #  A A.1\r\n    #1 1   3\r\n\r\n    #$B\r\n    #  B B.1\r\n    #1 4   7\r\n\r\n    #$X\r\n    #   X X.1\r\n    #1  2   1\r\n    #2  2  NA\r\n    #3  1   3\r\n    #4  1   1\r\n    #5 NA  NA\r\n    #6 NA  NA\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf we also need a check for constant value\r\n\r\n    is_constant &lt;- function(x) length(unique(x)) == 1L\r\n    lapply(L, function(x) if(all(sapply(x, is_constant))) x[1,, drop = FALSE] else x)\r\n    #$A\r\n    #  A A.1\r\n    #1 1   3\r\n\r\n    #$B\r\n    #  B B.1\r\n    #1 4   7\r\n\r\n    #$X\r\n    #   X X.1\r\n    #1  2   1\r\n    #2  2  NA\r\n    #3  1   3\r\n    #4  1   1\r\n    #5 NA  NA\r\n    #6 NA  NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311736/follow-up-separate-columns-with-constant-numbers-and-condense-them-to-one-row-i/58311783#58311783","title":"Follow-up: Separate columns with constant numbers and condense them to one row in R data.frame"}],"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58311783,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570653810,"creation_date":1570652529,"question_id":58311736,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311736","body_markdown":"This question is a follow-up on [**my previous question**][1].

It uses `data.table::foverlaps`, which does require (at least for this join) that the two frames be proper `data.table` objects, because it needs the keys to be clearly set.\r\n\r\nThis method has a few requirements:\r\n\r\n1. All timestamps are easily comparable numerically, I&#39;ll convert them to `POSIXt` objects;\r\n2. Keys are set for at least the second table (and might help in the first). The last two keys for each must be the beginning and end of each time interval; and\r\n3. Yes, you read that right, even the &quot;single time observations&quot; need two timestamp fields.\r\n\r\nNB: I use `magrittr` solely to break out the process into a pipeline of sorts; it is not at all required, just makes it easier to read. Also, I use `copy()` and `setDT` and then assign to a new variable primarily because (1) I iterated a few times but wanted to start with fresh data each time; and more importantly (2) because `data.table` operates in *side-effect*, I want to encourage you to try this but not kill your local data until you are comfortable working with it in side-effect. You can easily un-`data.table`-ize it after the fact.\r\n\r\nFirst, I&#39;ll set up the needed conditions.\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nlibrary(data.table)\r\nlibrary(magrittr)\r\n\r\nDB1dt &lt;- copy(DB1) %&gt;%\r\n  setDT() %&gt;%\r\n  .[, dt := as.POSIXct(paste(date, time), format = &quot;%d/%m/%Y %H:%M&quot;) ] %&gt;%\r\n  # remove unneeded columns\r\n  .[, c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;time&quot;) := NULL ] %&gt;%\r\n  .[, dt2 := dt ] %&gt;%\r\n  setkey(dt, dt2)\r\n\r\nDB2dt &lt;- copy(DB2) %&gt;%\r\n  setDT() %&gt;%\r\n  .[, startdt := as.POSIXct(paste(date, start.watch), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&quot;) ] %&gt;%\r\n  .[, enddt := as.POSIXct(paste(date, end.watch), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M&quot;) - 1e-5 ] %&gt;%\r\n  # remove unneeded columns\r\n  .[, c(&quot;date&quot;, &quot;start.watch&quot;, &quot;end.watch&quot;) := NULL ] %&gt;%\r\n  setkey(startdt, enddt)\r\n\r\nDB1dt[1:2,]\r\n#      lat    lon                  dt                 dt2\r\n# 1: 34.01 -53.07 2017-04-18 06:10:00 2017-04-18 06:10:00\r\n# 2: 34.02 -53.09 2017-04-18 06:20:00 2017-04-18 06:20:00\r\nDB2dt[1:2,]\r\n#                startdt               enddt\r\n# 1: 2017-04-18 05:00:00 2017-04-18 06:09:59\r\n# 2: 2017-04-18 06:10:00 2017-04-18 06:29:59\r\n```\r\n\r\nFYI: the use of `-1e-5` is because the &quot;within&quot;-join is closed on both ends (`[a,b]`, in constrast to open-right `[a,b)`), so equality on `enddt` would match. Over to you if you want to keep this.\r\n\r\nFrom here, the overlapping join is simply:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nfoverlaps(DB1dt, DB2dt, type = &quot;within&quot;, nomatch = NULL)\r\n#                startdt               enddt   lat    lon                  dt                 dt2\r\n# 1: 2017-04-18 06:10:00 2017-04-18 06:29:59 34.01 -53.07 2017-04-18 06:10:00 2017-04-18 06:10:00\r\n# 2: 2017-04-18 06:10:00 2017-04-18 06:29:59 34.02 -53.09 2017-04-18 06:20:00 2017-04-18 06:20:00\r\n# 3: 2017-04-18 06:30:00 2017-04-18 06:44:59 34.04 -53.10 2017-04-18 06:30:00 2017-04-18 06:30:00\r\n# 4: 2017-04-18 06:30:00 2017-04-18 06:44:59 34.05 -53.11 2017-04-18 06:40:00 2017-04-18 06:40:00\r\n# 5: 2017-04-18 07:20:00 2017-04-18 08:19:59 34.02 -53.09 2017-04-18 07:20:00 2017-04-18 07:20:00\r\n# 6: 2017-04-18 07:20:00 2017-04-18 08:19:59 34.04 -53.10 2017-04-18 07:30:00 2017-04-18 07:30:00\r\n# 7: 2017-04-19 06:20:00 2017-04-19 07:19:59 34.07 -53.13 2017-04-19 06:20:00 2017-04-19 06:20:00\r\n# 8: 2017-04-19 06:20:00 2017-04-19 07:19:59 34.08 -53.14 2017-04-19 06:30:00 2017-04-19 06:30:00\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSample data:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nDB1 &lt;- read.table(stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, text = &quot;\r\ndate         time   lat      lon     \r\n18/04/2017   6:10   34.01    -53.07\r\n18/04/2017   6:20   34.02    -53.09\r\n18/04/2017   6:30   34.04    -53.10\r\n18/04/2017   6:40   34.05    -53.11\r\n18/04/2017   6:50   34.07    -53.13\r\n18/04/2017   7:00   34.08    -53.14\r\n18/04/2017   7:10   34.01    -53.07\r\n18/04/2017   7:20   34.02    -53.09\r\n18/04/2017   7:30   34.04    -53.10\r\n19/04/2017   6:10   34.05    -53.11\r\n19/04/2017   6:20   34.07    -53.13\r\n19/04/2017   6:30   34.08    -53.14&quot;)\r\n\r\nDB2 &lt;- read.table(stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, text = &quot;\r\ndate          start.watch   end.watch\r\n2017-04-18    05:00         06:10\r\n2017-04-18    06:10         06:30\r\n2017-04-18    06:30         06:45\r\n2017-04-18    07:20         08:20\r\n2017-04-19    06:20         07:20\r\n2017-04-19    07:20         08:40&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRelated reading:\r\n\r\n- https://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/224705\r\n- https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/issues/3721","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311724/subsetting-a-gps-track-dataset-based-on-time-intervals-gathered-from-a-second-da/58313057#58313057","title":"Subsetting a gps-track dataset based on time intervals gathered from a second dataset"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11959094,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd0f133657b55f159d93ba34880e0066?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nahuel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11959094/nahuel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58313057,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570659847,"creation_date":1570652489,"question_id":58311724,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311724","body_markdown":"I have a large gps-track dataset and I want to extract only the positions taken while an observer was on duty.  In other terms, I need to cut the gps-tracks in several transects in which an observer was watching. The watching periods are in a second DB in which the observer registered the start and end of (roughly hourly) watching periods, so that the start time and end time registered for each day marks the start and end of the watch period for that day in most cases. However, it can happen that the watching was paused for some reason and then restarted some time later on the same day, so that two consecutive annotations can have a time gap between them. \r\n\r\nI was trying with match() and dplyr:filter() functions but can&#39;t came out with a solution.

Then iteratively continue with calculations of time diff of the immediate previous record according to the location group.\r\n\r\nThis loop works for the entire data set, but i don&#39;t know how to integrate it with dplyr::group_by for example or some other method..\r\n```\r\nfor (i in 2:nrow(df)) {\r\n      df[i,3] &lt;- \r\n        difftime(time1 = as.POSIXct(\r\n          df[i, 2], \r\n          format = &quot;%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S&quot;\r\n        ), \r\n        time2 = as.POSIXct(\r\n          df[i-1, 2], \r\n          format = &quot;%Y:%m:%d %H:%M:%S&quot;\r\n        ),\r\n        units = &quot;mins&quot;\r\n        )\r\n      \r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   location           date.time time.diff.mins\r\n1         2 2017-09-18 01:25:27             NA\r\n2         1 2017-09-19 05:19:43    1674.266667\r\n3         1 2017-09-21 21:42:33    3862.833333\r\n4         2 2017-09-22 00:49:16     186.716667\r\n5         3 2017-09-22 03:48:05     178.816667\r\n...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny advice or guidance would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311711/how-to-calculate-time-difference-between-dates-by-group","title":"how to calculate time difference between dates by group"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":166592,"user_id":87189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98e7d6edce863e7a1bf8199b082eb25e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tadman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/87189/tadman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570661676,"post_id":58311709,"comment_id":102987428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311709/how-to-use-a-rails-helper-in-a-pdf-template-inside-services-layer#comment102987428_58311709"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9169280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbbdaba57a30b0ec246bce426f1073be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Carlos Henrique Montalione","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9169280/carlos-henrique-montalione"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570729936,"post_id":58311871,"comment_id":103015200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311709/how-to-use-a-rails-helper-in-a-pdf-template-inside-services-layer/58311871#comment103015200_58311871"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":5054100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10204655637856181/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jhonatan Teixeira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5054100/jhonatan-teixeira"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570653150,"creation_date":1570653150,"answer_id":58311871,"question_id":58311709,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58311871","body_markdown":"You can make your module methods work as they were class methods by using \r\n\r\n&gt; module_function :method\r\n\r\nThe code looks like this:\r\n\r\n    module Helper\r\n      def helper_method; end\r\n\r\n      module_function :helper_method\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThen in your html.erb you do this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;% Helper.helper_method %&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58311709/how-to-use-a-rails-helper-in-a-pdf-template-inside-services-layer/58311871#58311871","title":"How to use a rails helper in a PDF template inside services layer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9169280,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbbdaba57a30b0ec246bce426f1073be?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Carlos Henrique Montalione","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9169280/carlos-henrique-montalione"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58311871,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570653150,"creation_date":1570652441,"question_id":58311709,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58311709","body_markdown":"I have a PDF template and I need to use a view helper method inside a HTML file that is in the services folder to generate the PDF.
