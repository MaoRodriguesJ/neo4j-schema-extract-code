However, it prints nil.\r\n\r\nIn the Test2 class, I expect *@hello* to print &quot;hello&quot; and it certainly does.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422618/instance-variable-in-ruby-resetting-as-nil","title":"Instance Variable in Ruby Resetting as Nil"},{"tags":["android","listview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":539997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef9924ff002c119e35cf7dd70c554e22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Hoffmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/539997/michael-hoffmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571269364,"post_id":58422616,"comment_id":103188189,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422616/android-listview-with-mvc#comment103188189_58422616"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":539997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef9924ff002c119e35cf7dd70c554e22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Hoffmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/539997/michael-hoffmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571275076,"post_id":58422616,"comment_id":103189294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422616/android-listview-with-mvc#comment103189294_58422616"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571269223,"creation_date":1571265995,"last_edit_date":1571269223,"question_id":58422616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422616","body_markdown":"Need some help. There are two buttons in the app &quot;Add Pizza&quot; and &quot;Display Pizzas&quot;. The purpose of the add button is to add the pizza&#39;s size and their selected topping in a toast message, which is already done. However, I hardcoded and I currently don&#39;t know how to go around this. This information should be stored in some array or arrayList. The purpose of the display feature is to display all the pizza options that were added before in a listView just below the two buttons in the same activity. \r\n\r\nI am able to display info that the user selects onto a listView. However the format it should show is &quot;Added (pizzasize) pizza with (topping1) &amp; (topping2) if both toppings were selected. But its currently showing &quot;Added (pizzasize) pizza with [topping1, topping2]. \r\n\r\nOnce you add the data to the list. For Ex: Small Pizza with cheese and click display it will show the correct results. However if you select for ex Medium Pizza with Pepperoni it will overwrite the previous value and show you two rows of Medium Pizza with Pepperoni. When the first row should show the most recent add (Medium Pizza with Pepperoni) and the second row should show (Small Pizza with cheese).

The server in turn return it back to me with an updated value in response.\r\nIf I try using the searchHits Object I still get the infinite loop\r\n```\r\nstate: {\r\n    visible: true,\r\n    loading: false,\r\n    search: {\r\n        value: “”,\r\n        searchHits: {....}, \r\n        highlight: false,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet val = search.value\r\nlet hits = search.searchHits\r\nuseEffect( () =&gt; {\r\n\r\n    axios.post(`/search=${state.search.value}`, {hits: hits}).then( resp =&gt; {\r\n        …do something or ..do nothing\r\n        state.setState( prevState =&gt; {\r\n            return {\r\n                …prevState,\r\n                search: {... prevState.search, hits: resp.hit}\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}, [val, hits])\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Use Case 1**: I want to search for a string  and then highlight when I get results\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n    state: {\r\n        visible: true,\r\n        loading: false,\r\n        search: {\r\n            value: “”,\r\n            highlight: false,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\r\n        \r\n        axios.get(`/search=${state.search.value}`).then( resp =&gt; {\r\n            …do something or ..do nothing\r\n            state.setState( prevState =&gt; {\r\n                return {\r\n                    …prevState,\r\n                    search: {... prevState.search, highlight: true}\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n        })\r\n    }, [state.search])\r\n\r\n\r\nIn useEffect I make the API call using `search.value`.\r\neslint complains that there is a dependency on `state.search` , it does not recognize `state.search.value`. Even if you pass `state.search.value` it complains about `state.search`\r\n\r\nNow if you pass `state.search` as dependecy it goes in an infinite loop because after the api call we are updating the `highlights` flag inside search.\r\n\r\nWhich will trigger another state update and a recursive loop.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid this is to not have nested Objects in state or move the highlights flag outside search, but I am trying to not go that route give the sheer dependecies I have.\r\nI would rather have an Object in state called search the way it is. Is there any way to better approach this.\r\nIf I want to keep my state Object as above how do I handle the infinite loop\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422597/react-hooks-handling-objects-as-dependency-in-useeffects","title":"React Hooks: Handling Objects as dependency in useEffects"},{"tags":["python-3.x","numpy","statistics"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7189,"user_id":4585963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Yzwc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hilberts_drinking_problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4585963/hilberts-drinking-problem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571271786,"post_id":58422596,"comment_id":103188666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422596/how-to-draw-a-random-sample-from-a-normal-distribution-withing-a-range-with-nump#comment103188666_58422596"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":6075996,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57e8d3941d4322c38cadb99a14f2f073?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jussi Nurminen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6075996/jussi-nurminen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571302288,"creation_date":1571302288,"answer_id":58428569,"question_id":58422596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58428569","body_markdown":"If you limit the minimum and maximum, the data will no longer be normally distributed.

However, I do not have any experience with Maven so this would be a difficult process. Is there a different shell command that I should use to make this build and run properly? I attempted to compile each source code file individually but that also returned errors: \r\n\r\n    javac src/Objects/Product.java\r\n    javac src/Reader/ReadExcel.java\r\n    javac src/Reader/WriteExcel.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/runnuer/ActiveIQ.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/runner/Ascend.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/running/LinkedIn.java\r\n    javac src/GUI.java\r\n    java GUI\r\n\r\n If there is no way to make this work with a different shell command, what options do I have to get the automation to run correctly on the server? Thanks in advance for any help that you are able to provide.

The suggested fix for this is:\r\n```\r\ndef lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str,unique=None) -&gt; int:\r\n    if unique is None:\r\n        unique = []\r\n```\r\nThis is rather strange behavior, but since everything is an object in Python, what it appears to mean is that such arguments result in the function remembering its state after each call (behaving rather like a function with a static variable inside it in other languages).

As for allowing children threads to spawn off children of its own using \r\nsubprocess runs the risk of creating a little army of zombie \r\n&#39;grandchildren&#39; if either the parent or child threads terminate before \r\nthe subprocess completes and returns\r\n\r\nI have also found [workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8963618/955273) which allow this kind of &quot;pool within a pool&quot;

Central to the problem was that the DHCP Option Set for my VPC mandated DNS servers that were located in a different VPC.  My VPC-enabled lambda was associated with a subnet that did not have a route table entry to specifically address DNS.  What I needed was a route in the route table that would point those DNS server addresses through the transit gateway to reach the other VPC. Instead my subnet had a route which directed DNS requests to the public internet (which, unsurprisingly, did not find a path to the other VPC).\r\n\r\nThere was another subnet in my VPC which did have a route table and route which pointed to the transit gateway.  This other subnet was also eligible for having the associated lambda.  So merely changing the subnet used by my lambda was sufficient to make the whole thing work.\r\n\r\nDiscovering the source of this problem was hampered by other factors, such as AWS Flow Logs showing &quot;ACCEPT / OK&quot; for DNS requests - when in fact they were not working.

My actual Python code, which works when the lambda is not associated with a VPC, looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    def lambda_handler(event, context):\r\n        from botocore.client import Config\r\n        from botocore.session import Session\r\n\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;Create Session&#39;)\r\n        s = Session()\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;Session Created&#39;)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;fetching client&#39;)\r\n        ec2_res = boto3.resource(&#39;ec2&#39;)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;got vpc resource&#39;)\r\n\r\n        #I&#39;ve tried different approaches to creating a client\r\n        ec2_client = s.create_client(&#39;ec2&#39;,config=Config(connect_timeout=45, read_timeout=45, retries={&#39;max_attempts&#39;: 0}))\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;, config=config)\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;, endpoint_url=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2&quot;,config=config)\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;,endpoint_url=endpoint)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;fetched_client&#39;)\r\n        \r\n        route_table_id = os.environ[&#39;fromTGWRouteTableId&#39;]\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;got route table id from environment&#39;)\r\n\r\n        try: \r\n            logger.info(f&#39;route table(s):{route_table_id}&#39;)\r\n            #this request will throw an exception in 40 seconds.\r\n            route_table = ec2_client.describe_route_tables(RouteTableIds=[route_table_id])\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;got client response for route_tables&#39;)\r\n            rt = route_table[&#39;RouteTables&#39;][0]\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;The RT ID is: {rt.id}&#39;)\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;{type(e)}&#39;)\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;{e}&#39;)\r\n\r\n        return\r\n\r\nI had to adjust the lambda and boto3 client timeouts *just right* to actually capture the error. \r\n Anything else would result in a timeout.  Here are the CloudWatch log entries for the lambda:\r\n\r\n    START RequestId: a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Version: $LATEST\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:38.914Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Create Session\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.36Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Session Created\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.92Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 fetching client\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.94Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Found credentials in environment variables.\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 got vpc resource\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 fetched_client\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 got route table id from environment\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 route table(s):rtb-0d92f4db98072d6fc\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:49.493Z bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 &lt;class &#39;botocore.exceptions.EndpointConnectionError&#39;&gt;\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:49.493Z bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 Could not connect to the endpoint URL: &quot;https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/&quot;\r\n    END RequestId: bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32\r\n    REPORT RequestId: bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 Duration: 40960.97 ms Billed Duration: 41000 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 83 MB\r\n    2 unknown eni-07003b087845964ff - - - - - - - 1571257388 1571257400 - NODATA\r\n\r\nAny ideas of what I&#39;m overlooking?\r\n\r\n##Update\r\n\r\nIn my Python code, I&#39;ve added the following test:\r\n\r\n    contents = urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;https://google.com&quot;).readline()\r\n    logger.info(f&#39;http response: {contents}&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe above throws a URLError with the message `urlopen error [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution`.  \r\n\r\nI then created an Ubuntu EC2 instance in a public subnet of my VPC. A ping test to google.com failed with &quot;unknown host&quot;. **If I explicitly provide a public internet IP address to ping, then it works.**\r\n\r\nLikewise `host` and `dig` failed, as shown:\r\n\r\n    ubuntu@ip-10-136-80-220:/etc$ host google.com\r\n    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\r\n    ubuntu@ip-10-136-80-220:/etc$ dig google.com\r\n\r\n    ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; google.com\r\n    ;; global options: +cmd\r\n    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\r\n\r\nI can make `dig` succeed if I explicitly point it at a public DNS server.  This worked: `dig @8.8.8.8 google.com`.\r\n\r\nBelow are the contents of my resolv.conf, with the real company name masked with &quot;mycompany.com&quot;:\r\n\r\n    # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\r\n    #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\r\n    nameserver 10.136.7.233\r\n    nameserver 10.136.7.249\r\n    search preprod.awse1.mycompany.com\r\n\r\nThe above corresponds to the following DHCP option set.  \r\n\r\n    domain-name = preprod.awse1.mycompany.com; domain-name-servers = 10.136.7.233, 10.136.7.249;\r\n\r\nI think both of the above DNS servers are provided in a different AWS account.  Still, a `ping` test fails on both of those DNS server addresses.  I&#39;m not sure if that means these servers don&#39;t exist, or if they simply do not respond to ICMP.\r\n\r\nJust now I created my own DHCP Option Set, the same as the above, but I changed the DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and associated this to the VPC.  I then revised my lambda to output the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to verify it &quot;took&quot; the new 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 DNS servers - and the lambda still got the same DNS errors!  It is very strange that an explicit `dig @8.8.8.8 google.com` from the EC2 instance works, but a lambda associated with the same subnet gets a DNS error. I&#39;m wondering if the ephemeral ENI&#39;s associated with the Lambda have their own DNS server records - and they are not updating quickly enough to reflect the changes I&#39;ve made to my lambda?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the VPC has &quot;DNS resolution&quot; and &quot;DNS hostnames&quot; both `enabled`.\r\n\r\nWhy would DNS not be working?  As shown, it doesn&#39;t matter whether I&#39;m using my own DNS servers or those provided by google.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47078759/api-timeouts-in-aws-lambda\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51380018/aws-lambda-in-vpc-sometimes-doesnt-have-internet-access\r\n  [3]: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422525/lambda-in-vpc-has-connection-error-against-aws-api","title":"Lambda in VPC has Connection Error against AWS API"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265375,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187258,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187258_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265464,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187280_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265541,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187304,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187304_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571266495,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187544_58422524"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11985562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBlnBnGPPp1EMs--jy9PzdVmyYrGoHbxFbeWewp-6w=k-s128","display_name":"Salief","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11985562/salief"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43,"user_id":12021198,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDzTzlbZsM4hfO2UGXh5tX7YoZ3hbCYjdHuVXDT=k-s128","display_name":"Phardin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12021198/phardin"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571274753,"creation_date":1571265202,"last_edit_date":1571274753,"question_id":58422524,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422524","body_markdown":"I&#39;m struggling to understand why when applying the opacity property to a div I have that holds a background-image the property seems to affect some text within my html but not others.\r\n\r\nHere is the basic layout of my markup.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    html,\r\n    body {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .background_image {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      /* content: &quot;&quot;;

IMHO implementing an interface should result in an *exact* implementation, not one which roughly matches?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422516/implementing-generic-interfaces-in-typescript","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Implementing generic interfaces in TypeScript"},{"tags":["c#"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10419,"user_id":2416958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8lZr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2416958/stefan"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571265283,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187229_58422513"},{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265693,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187344,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187344_58422513"},{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265780,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187366,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187366_58422513"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571265379,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187259,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187259_58422539"},{"owner":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571265406,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187268,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187268_58422539"},{"owner":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265456,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187277_58422539"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571265397,"last_edit_date":1571265397,"creation_date":1571265321,"answer_id":58422539,"question_id":58422513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58422539","body_markdown":"      Console.WriteLine(names[i].Names);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#58422539","title":"Not able to initiate the List&lt;customer&gt;.

It only produces the incorrect results when p is the resulting value from the MongoDB call.\r\n\r\nI assume this implies something about the way the value is stored in the MongoDB call, as the property with type string is not recognized as a property until coerced through the parse(stringify(p)) call.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422481/json-stringify-shows-property-value-but-cannot-access-property-directly","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"JSON.stringify shows property value, but cannot access property directly"},{"tags":["java","c++","redirect","cmd","pipe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3258,"user_id":10957435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/663773cb7f0bc33d3025eb2f9d47799c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chipster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10957435/chipster"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571265328,"post_id":58422474,"comment_id":103187244,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c#comment103187244_58422474"},{"owner":{"reputation":26082,"user_id":981744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJi4S.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erwin Bolwidt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/981744/erwin-bolwidt"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571266206,"post_id":58422474,"comment_id":103187483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c#comment103187483_58422474"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":539,"user_id":882756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a3f7f896bb39fffe05701ded73d0df8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Christian Wolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/882756/christian-wolf"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571317517,"post_id":58433351,"comment_id":103207183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c/58433351#comment103207183_58433351"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571317720,"last_edit_date":1571317720,"creation_date":1571317389,"answer_id":58433351,"question_id":58422474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433351","body_markdown":"The problem is that &quot;java -version&quot; responds on stderr, which must be redirected using 2&gt; not &gt;.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion**\r\n\r\nWrite output to file using &#39;2&gt; filename.txt&#39;\r\n\r\n    system(&quot;java -version &amp;&gt; temp.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n    std::ifstream fin(&quot;temp.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n    std::string Result = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    std::string Line;\r\n\r\n    while(getline(fin, Line))\r\n        Result+=Line;\r\n\r\n    fin.close();\r\n\r\n(Thanks to Erwin Bolwidt)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c/58433351#58433351","title":"Get result of command java -version in c++"}],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571319094,"creation_date":1571264939,"last_edit_date":1571319094,"question_id":58422474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422474","body_markdown":"I am trying to see whether or not the installed java version is good to run from c++. \r\n\r\nI looked everywhere, yet neither [pipes][1] nor redirecting the system() call using &quot;cmd + &gt; txtfile.txt&quot; seem to work with the output of &quot;java -version&quot;.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why, maybe the output stream can&#39;t be redirected?

You only need one reference to jQuery (making sure it is referenced *before* Bootstrap). Having multiple references will throw errors.\r\n\r\n - You also appear to reference Bootstrap twice (once from the CDN at the end of your `&lt;head&gt;`, and once at the start of your `&lt;head&gt;` with a local reference). Multiple Bootstrap references will also likely throw errors.\r\n\r\n - You also appear to be missing a reference to [PopperJS][1], which is a required dependency of Bootstrap 4.\r\n\r\n - `css\\splitslick\\style.css` is referenced with backslashes; you&#39;ll want forrward slashes.\r\n\r\n - Your local `script.js` and `style.css` come *before* Bootstrap&#39;s JS and CSS, which means that Bootstrap will overwrite your own code; you&#39;ll want your code to be loaded *last*.\r\n\r\nRemoving these additional references, and making sure that Bootstrap\r\n   comes *after* jQuery, PopperJS and Tether should fix your problem. Shifting your own JavaScript and CSS to the bottom of each respective section should cause it to override any conflicting Bootstrap code.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a modified `&lt;head&gt;` that should work. Take note of the following order:\r\n\r\n - Bootstrap 4 CSS -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Fonts -&gt; Custom CSS\r\n - jQuery -&gt; PopperJS -&gt; Tether -&gt; Bootstrap 4 JS -&gt; Custom JS\r\n   \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Printing Prime&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;img/favi.png&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/5.0.0/normalize.min.css&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick.min.css&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick-theme.min.css&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans&amp;display=swap&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:100&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/splitslick/style.css&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;css/home.css&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tether/1.4.0/js/tether.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-DztdAPBWPRXSA/3eYEEUWrWCy7G5KFbe8fFjk5JAIxUYHKkDx6Qin1DkWx51bBrb&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;js/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://popper.js.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422465/why-is-that-when-i-add-in-the-following-bootstrap-my-page-become-white/58422587#58422587","title":"Why is that when I add in the following bootstrap my page become white?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12229230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f76f59a61068d784a5c9f38faa283683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NhungN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229230/nhungn"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571266136,"creation_date":1571264872,"question_id":58422465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422465","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a class project that required me to code a website that sells something.

You can use a colon to rename a part of your query. I added `articles: ` before your allMarkdownRemark. In the resulting JSON the allMarkdownRemark will now be called &#39;articles&#39;. You can see this in the forEach loop that now iterates over &#39;result.data.articles&#39;. I also added a query for the &#39;projects&#39; entity you want. Renaming them to articles and projects allows us to easily iterate over every article and every project, and create the correct pages for these entities.\r\n\r\nThe projects query is now a carbon copy of your articles query. In reality you should provide a query here that returns only the projects, but I don&#39;t know where you have those. Then create separate loops for the projects and the articles in which you create the correct pages.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) =&gt; {\r\n    const { createPage } = actions\r\n\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n        graphql(`{\r\n            articles: allMarkdownRemark {\r\n                edges {\r\n                    node {\r\n                        fields {\r\n                            slug\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            projects: allMarkdownRemark {\r\n                edges {\r\n                    node {\r\n                        fields {\r\n                            slug\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }`).then(result =&gt; {\r\n\r\n            // In this loop we only take the articles returned by the query, and\r\n            // pass them to the src/templates/article.js component.\r\n            result.data.articles.edges.forEach(({ node }) =&gt; {\r\n                createPage({\r\n                    // Rather than prepending every slug with &#39;/article&#39; in the\r\n                    // createNodeField call, you can add it here to get more\r\n                    // flexibility, and to allow different types to have different\r\n                    // path prefixes.\r\n                    path: `article/${node.fields.slug}`,\r\n                    component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/article.js`),\r\n                    context: {\r\n                        slug: node.fields.slug,\r\n                    },\r\n                })\r\n            })\r\n\r\n            // In this loop we do the same thing, only with the projects this\r\n            // time, and passing them to the project.js component I&#39;m assuming\r\n            // you have. I&#39;ve prepended the path with &#39;project/&#39; to separate\r\n            // the projects from the articles.\r\n            result.data.projects.edges.forEach(({ node }) =&gt; {\r\n                createPage({\r\n                    path: `project/${node.fields.slug}`,\r\n                    component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/project.js`),\r\n                    context: {\r\n                        slug: node.fields.slug,\r\n                    },\r\n                })\r\n            })\r\n\r\n            resolve()\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added some indentation to make things a little easier to reason about. I may have made some syntax errors along the way, so beware of that.\r\n\r\nI noticed that in your `onCreateNode` call, you set the slug of every markdown file to &#39;article/${slug}`. If your projects are also markdown files you should not do this, because it will also give your project markdown files slugs that start with &#39;/article&#39;. In the code above, I set the correct path in the createPage call, not in createNodeField.\r\n\r\nOne thing you have to bear in mind is that if you&#39;ve got both your articles as well as your projects as markdown files, your query is going to have a rough time telling them apart. The way I usually fix this is by adding a &#39;type&#39; field to the frontmatter. So in your case you&#39;d add: `type: article` to the frontmatter of all your articles, and `type: project` to all your projects. The frontmatter part is the part at the top of your markdown file, between the three dashes lines:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntype: article\r\nname: something\r\netc, etc...\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can filter your markdown files like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ngraphql(`query {\r\n      projects: allMarkdownRemark ( filter: {frontmatter: { type: { eq: &quot;project&quot; } } } ) {\r\n        edges {\r\n          node {\r\n            fields {\r\n              slug\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return only markdown files that have type project. Do the same thing for your articles. If you use Netlify CMS, you can add a hidden field to automatically add the correct type to help you filter.\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider changing the promise into an async/await call. This is optional, but in my opinion it makes things a lot easier to read. Check out gatsby&#39;s tutorial here https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/#creating-pages for an example of async/await in the createPages API.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422460/creating-a-second-blog-template-on-gatsby/58423473#58423473","title":"Creating a Second Blog Template on Gatsby"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11513851,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x2Wct_oc918/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdB3EC7i-90TGeE6hK9-Ni0n4kWFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Judo Paku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11513851/judo-paku"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571274019,"creation_date":1571264839,"question_id":58422460,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422460","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a second blog template on my Gatsby site.

It ships with a default user name and password, and they you&#39;re on your own. Postgres.app is a nicely compiled version of Postgres that you can run by double-clicking, you&#39;ll need other tools (and knowledge) to take advantage of Postgres. As you&#39;ll have noticed, the UI for Postgres.app is pretty much a few buttons to configure a server, and to give you shortcuts to the logs, configuration files, and data. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use psql (as mentioned), or any of the other command line tools, they&#39;re embedded in the application&#39;s package. Right-click, open the package, open Contents, open Versions, open the version you use, and look in bin.\r\n\r\nIf you want a GUI tool, there are many options. Since you say Postgres.app, I&#39;ll assume macOS. You&#39;ve found Postico, SQLPro for Postgres is good, TablePlus is also good. Those tools have fairly uncluttered UIs. If you want or need more features, pgAdmin has a whole lot to offer, and it&#39;s free. I end up using Navicat a lot, even though it has a UI that screams &quot;Look Ma! I wrote it in Java!&quot; It gets a lot done. I&#39;d say that day-to-day on macOS, I use SQLPro most. But, really, it&#39;s largely a matter of taste. psql is quite powerful, and you&#39;ll find no short of help for that. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422447/how-to-setup-a-password-for-postgresql-in-postgreapp/58429777#58429777","title":"How to setup a password for PostgreSQL in postgreapp?"}],"owner":{"reputation":367,"user_id":7065723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s8a0ALrnDfs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA1g/s9H64FJoboU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Venkateshreddy Pala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7065723/venkateshreddy-pala"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571305959,"creation_date":1571264770,"last_edit_date":1571294798,"question_id":58422447,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422447","body_markdown":"I am using postgresapp for the PostgreSQL and without password I was able to connect to the database and perform operations.

Maybe the compiler optimizes this away)\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n    println!(&quot;user: {:#?}&quot;, u1);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut if you really want to have two users point to the same name in memory (pretty sure you don&#39;t), there are a couple of options:\r\n\r\n- You can change `String` to `&amp;&#39;static str`. This however means that you have to specify it when you compile. (You can&#39;t have a user type in their name at runtime, and store it in user)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    #[derive(Debug)]\r\n    struct User {\r\n        first: &amp;&#39;static str,\r\n        last: &amp;&#39;static str,\r\n        age: u32,\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    fn main() {\r\n        let u1 = User {\r\n            first: &quot;John&quot;,\r\n            last: &quot;Doe&quot;,\r\n            age: 22,\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        let u2 = User {\r\n            first: &quot;Mary&quot;,\r\n            ..u1\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        println!(&quot;user: {:#?}&quot;, u1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n - You can use a `Rc` to keep track of the references to a piece of memory.

The answer to this is to use script2 as a module. \r\n\r\nI had actually tried to do this already, but it was crashing my script1 because I had dashes in the naming of my scripts, which works fine when they are scripts, but for some reason does not work when they are used as modules and yet gives you no error either. It just bombs out of the script altogether (on my linux/python 3 setup this is the case).\r\n\r\nThe solution was surprisingly simple once I resolved the file naming issues.\r\n\r\nin script1.py I now have \r\n```\r\nimport script2\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen I call the main() function from the second script with\r\n\r\n```\r\nscript2.main\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did not have to make any changes to script2, it runs from the local folder so needs no additional path setting, and I can now remove all the script calling code as well. \r\n\r\nThe main point being don&#39;t use dashes in the naming of modules as it gives you no error warnings but wont import them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422427/how-to-pass-python-data-back-to-the-calling-script-about-a-browser-window-left-o/58424263#58424263","title":"How to pass python data back to the calling script about a browser window left open when the called script closes"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9594269,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mjHhZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdkb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9594269/mdkb"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58424263,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571281283,"creation_date":1571264634,"question_id":58422427,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422427","body_markdown":"I am trying to find the best method to pass data from python script2.py back to the calling script (script1.py). I am using Python 3 on Linux.\r\n\r\nScript1 calls script2.py which then uses Selenium to open a browser window and do something things. When script2 ends, the browser remains open and script1 continues. What I want is to then be able to work on the browser window that was opened in script2, from within script1.\r\n\r\nSo far I have failed to find a suitable way to pass the information about the open browser window from script2 back to script1. I believe part of the issue is because when script2 is called, script1 waits until it has closed before continuing on, so there is no way to grab the variables open in script2. I do not want to change this aspect either.\r\n\r\nin script1.py the below code calls script2 like this: \r\n```\r\ncmd = [&#39;python3&#39;, &#39;/home/admin/Desktop/Python_stuff/live-scripts/script2.py&#39;]\r\n        subprocess.Popen(cmd).wait() # Python will now wait for script to end before continuing\r\n```\r\n\r\nin script2 the below code opens the browser initially (which currently stays open after script2 closes) like this:\r\n```\r\ndriver.get(targetURL)\r\n```\r\nI have looked at Pickle but could not get it to work how I wanted and will probably next try to use import JSON.

However, it prints nil.\r\n\r\nIn the Test2 class, I expect *@hello* to print &quot;hello&quot; and it certainly does.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422618/instance-variable-in-ruby-resetting-as-nil","title":"Instance Variable in Ruby Resetting as Nil"},{"tags":["android","listview"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":539997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef9924ff002c119e35cf7dd70c554e22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Hoffmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/539997/michael-hoffmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571269364,"post_id":58422616,"comment_id":103188189,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422616/android-listview-with-mvc#comment103188189_58422616"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1649,"user_id":539997,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef9924ff002c119e35cf7dd70c554e22?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michael Hoffmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/539997/michael-hoffmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571275076,"post_id":58422616,"comment_id":103189294,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422616/android-listview-with-mvc#comment103189294_58422616"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12099956,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7785442cbf251db82ed5872cec50d295?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099956/bob"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571269223,"creation_date":1571265995,"last_edit_date":1571269223,"question_id":58422616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422616","body_markdown":"Need some help. There are two buttons in the app &quot;Add Pizza&quot; and &quot;Display Pizzas&quot;. The purpose of the add button is to add the pizza&#39;s size and their selected topping in a toast message, which is already done. However, I hardcoded and I currently don&#39;t know how to go around this. This information should be stored in some array or arrayList. The purpose of the display feature is to display all the pizza options that were added before in a listView just below the two buttons in the same activity. \r\n\r\nI am able to display info that the user selects onto a listView. However the format it should show is &quot;Added (pizzasize) pizza with (topping1) &amp; (topping2) if both toppings were selected. But its currently showing &quot;Added (pizzasize) pizza with [topping1, topping2]. \r\n\r\nOnce you add the data to the list. For Ex: Small Pizza with cheese and click display it will show the correct results. However if you select for ex Medium Pizza with Pepperoni it will overwrite the previous value and show you two rows of Medium Pizza with Pepperoni. When the first row should show the most recent add (Medium Pizza with Pepperoni) and the second row should show (Small Pizza with cheese).

The server in turn return it back to me with an updated value in response.\r\nIf I try using the searchHits Object I still get the infinite loop\r\n```\r\nstate: {\r\n    visible: true,\r\n    loading: false,\r\n    search: {\r\n        value: “”,\r\n        searchHits: {....}, \r\n        highlight: false,\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet val = search.value\r\nlet hits = search.searchHits\r\nuseEffect( () =&gt; {\r\n\r\n    axios.post(`/search=${state.search.value}`, {hits: hits}).then( resp =&gt; {\r\n        …do something or ..do nothing\r\n        state.setState( prevState =&gt; {\r\n            return {\r\n                …prevState,\r\n                search: {... prevState.search, hits: resp.hit}\r\n            }\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n}, [val, hits])\r\n\r\n```\r\n**Use Case 1**: I want to search for a string  and then highlight when I get results\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n    state: {\r\n        visible: true,\r\n        loading: false,\r\n        search: {\r\n            value: “”,\r\n            highlight: false,\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    useEffect( () =&gt; {\r\n        \r\n        axios.get(`/search=${state.search.value}`).then( resp =&gt; {\r\n            …do something or ..do nothing\r\n            state.setState( prevState =&gt; {\r\n                return {\r\n                    …prevState,\r\n                    search: {... prevState.search, highlight: true}\r\n                }\r\n            })\r\n        })\r\n    }, [state.search])\r\n\r\n\r\nIn useEffect I make the API call using `search.value`.\r\neslint complains that there is a dependency on `state.search` , it does not recognize `state.search.value`. Even if you pass `state.search.value` it complains about `state.search`\r\n\r\nNow if you pass `state.search` as dependecy it goes in an infinite loop because after the api call we are updating the `highlights` flag inside search.\r\n\r\nWhich will trigger another state update and a recursive loop.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid this is to not have nested Objects in state or move the highlights flag outside search, but I am trying to not go that route give the sheer dependecies I have.\r\nI would rather have an Object in state called search the way it is. Is there any way to better approach this.\r\nIf I want to keep my state Object as above how do I handle the infinite loop\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422597/react-hooks-handling-objects-as-dependency-in-useeffects","title":"React Hooks: Handling Objects as dependency in useEffects"},{"tags":["python-3.x","numpy","statistics"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7189,"user_id":4585963,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Yzwc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"hilberts_drinking_problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4585963/hilberts-drinking-problem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571271786,"post_id":58422596,"comment_id":103188666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422596/how-to-draw-a-random-sample-from-a-normal-distribution-withing-a-range-with-nump#comment103188666_58422596"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":6075996,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/57e8d3941d4322c38cadb99a14f2f073?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jussi Nurminen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6075996/jussi-nurminen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571302288,"creation_date":1571302288,"answer_id":58428569,"question_id":58422596,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58428569","body_markdown":"If you limit the minimum and maximum, the data will no longer be normally distributed.

However, I do not have any experience with Maven so this would be a difficult process. Is there a different shell command that I should use to make this build and run properly? I attempted to compile each source code file individually but that also returned errors: \r\n\r\n    javac src/Objects/Product.java\r\n    javac src/Reader/ReadExcel.java\r\n    javac src/Reader/WriteExcel.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/runnuer/ActiveIQ.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/runner/Ascend.java\r\n    javac src/co/mitch/selenium/running/LinkedIn.java\r\n    javac src/GUI.java\r\n    java GUI\r\n\r\n If there is no way to make this work with a different shell command, what options do I have to get the automation to run correctly on the server? Thanks in advance for any help that you are able to provide.

The suggested fix for this is:\r\n```\r\ndef lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str,unique=None) -&gt; int:\r\n    if unique is None:\r\n        unique = []\r\n```\r\nThis is rather strange behavior, but since everything is an object in Python, what it appears to mean is that such arguments result in the function remembering its state after each call (behaving rather like a function with a static variable inside it in other languages).

As for allowing children threads to spawn off children of its own using \r\nsubprocess runs the risk of creating a little army of zombie \r\n&#39;grandchildren&#39; if either the parent or child threads terminate before \r\nthe subprocess completes and returns\r\n\r\nI have also found [workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8963618/955273) which allow this kind of &quot;pool within a pool&quot;

Central to the problem was that the DHCP Option Set for my VPC mandated DNS servers that were located in a different VPC.  My VPC-enabled lambda was associated with a subnet that did not have a route table entry to specifically address DNS.  What I needed was a route in the route table that would point those DNS server addresses through the transit gateway to reach the other VPC. Instead my subnet had a route which directed DNS requests to the public internet (which, unsurprisingly, did not find a path to the other VPC).\r\n\r\nThere was another subnet in my VPC which did have a route table and route which pointed to the transit gateway.  This other subnet was also eligible for having the associated lambda.  So merely changing the subnet used by my lambda was sufficient to make the whole thing work.\r\n\r\nDiscovering the source of this problem was hampered by other factors, such as AWS Flow Logs showing &quot;ACCEPT / OK&quot; for DNS requests - when in fact they were not working.

My actual Python code, which works when the lambda is not associated with a VPC, looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    def lambda_handler(event, context):\r\n        from botocore.client import Config\r\n        from botocore.session import Session\r\n\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;Create Session&#39;)\r\n        s = Session()\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;Session Created&#39;)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;fetching client&#39;)\r\n        ec2_res = boto3.resource(&#39;ec2&#39;)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;got vpc resource&#39;)\r\n\r\n        #I&#39;ve tried different approaches to creating a client\r\n        ec2_client = s.create_client(&#39;ec2&#39;,config=Config(connect_timeout=45, read_timeout=45, retries={&#39;max_attempts&#39;: 0}))\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;, config=config)\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;, endpoint_url=&quot;https://aws.amazon.com/ec2&quot;,config=config)\r\n        #ec2_client = boto3.client(&#39;ec2&#39;,endpoint_url=endpoint)\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;fetched_client&#39;)\r\n        \r\n        route_table_id = os.environ[&#39;fromTGWRouteTableId&#39;]\r\n        logger.info(f&#39;got route table id from environment&#39;)\r\n\r\n        try: \r\n            logger.info(f&#39;route table(s):{route_table_id}&#39;)\r\n            #this request will throw an exception in 40 seconds.\r\n            route_table = ec2_client.describe_route_tables(RouteTableIds=[route_table_id])\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;got client response for route_tables&#39;)\r\n            rt = route_table[&#39;RouteTables&#39;][0]\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;The RT ID is: {rt.id}&#39;)\r\n        except Exception as e:\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;{type(e)}&#39;)\r\n            logger.info(f&#39;{e}&#39;)\r\n\r\n        return\r\n\r\nI had to adjust the lambda and boto3 client timeouts *just right* to actually capture the error. \r\n Anything else would result in a timeout.  Here are the CloudWatch log entries for the lambda:\r\n\r\n    START RequestId: a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Version: $LATEST\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:38.914Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Create Session\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.36Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Session Created\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.92Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 fetching client\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:39.94Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 Found credentials in environment variables.\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 got vpc resource\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 fetched_client\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 got route table id from environment\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:40.33Z a3ce5c07-f5ec-4b91-b6d8-c94e05fbecc9 route table(s):rtb-0d92f4db98072d6fc\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:49.493Z bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 &lt;class &#39;botocore.exceptions.EndpointConnectionError&#39;&gt;\r\n    [INFO] 2019-10-16T20:22:49.493Z bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 Could not connect to the endpoint URL: &quot;https://ec2.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/&quot;\r\n    END RequestId: bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32\r\n    REPORT RequestId: bd2bf6b7-2fa6-46ea-8115-cb830cb07f32 Duration: 40960.97 ms Billed Duration: 41000 ms Memory Size: 128 MB Max Memory Used: 83 MB\r\n    2 unknown eni-07003b087845964ff - - - - - - - 1571257388 1571257400 - NODATA\r\n\r\nAny ideas of what I&#39;m overlooking?\r\n\r\n##Update\r\n\r\nIn my Python code, I&#39;ve added the following test:\r\n\r\n    contents = urllib.request.urlopen(&quot;https://google.com&quot;).readline()\r\n    logger.info(f&#39;http response: {contents}&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe above throws a URLError with the message `urlopen error [Errno -3] Temporary failure in name resolution`.  \r\n\r\nI then created an Ubuntu EC2 instance in a public subnet of my VPC. A ping test to google.com failed with &quot;unknown host&quot;. **If I explicitly provide a public internet IP address to ping, then it works.**\r\n\r\nLikewise `host` and `dig` failed, as shown:\r\n\r\n    ubuntu@ip-10-136-80-220:/etc$ host google.com\r\n    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\r\n    ubuntu@ip-10-136-80-220:/etc$ dig google.com\r\n\r\n    ; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; google.com\r\n    ;; global options: +cmd\r\n    ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached\r\n\r\nI can make `dig` succeed if I explicitly point it at a public DNS server.  This worked: `dig @8.8.8.8 google.com`.\r\n\r\nBelow are the contents of my resolv.conf, with the real company name masked with &quot;mycompany.com&quot;:\r\n\r\n    # Dynamic resolv.conf(5) file for glibc resolver(3) generated by resolvconf(8)\r\n    #     DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE BY HAND -- YOUR CHANGES WILL BE OVERWRITTEN\r\n    nameserver 10.136.7.233\r\n    nameserver 10.136.7.249\r\n    search preprod.awse1.mycompany.com\r\n\r\nThe above corresponds to the following DHCP option set.  \r\n\r\n    domain-name = preprod.awse1.mycompany.com; domain-name-servers = 10.136.7.233, 10.136.7.249;\r\n\r\nI think both of the above DNS servers are provided in a different AWS account.  Still, a `ping` test fails on both of those DNS server addresses.  I&#39;m not sure if that means these servers don&#39;t exist, or if they simply do not respond to ICMP.\r\n\r\nJust now I created my own DHCP Option Set, the same as the above, but I changed the DNS servers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 and associated this to the VPC.  I then revised my lambda to output the contents of /etc/resolv.conf to verify it &quot;took&quot; the new 8.8.8.8/8.8.4.4 DNS servers - and the lambda still got the same DNS errors!  It is very strange that an explicit `dig @8.8.8.8 google.com` from the EC2 instance works, but a lambda associated with the same subnet gets a DNS error. I&#39;m wondering if the ephemeral ENI&#39;s associated with the Lambda have their own DNS server records - and they are not updating quickly enough to reflect the changes I&#39;ve made to my lambda?\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the VPC has &quot;DNS resolution&quot; and &quot;DNS hostnames&quot; both `enabled`.\r\n\r\nWhy would DNS not be working?  As shown, it doesn&#39;t matter whether I&#39;m using my own DNS servers or those provided by google.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47078759/api-timeouts-in-aws-lambda\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51380018/aws-lambda-in-vpc-sometimes-doesnt-have-internet-access\r\n  [3]: https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/internet-access-lambda-function/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422525/lambda-in-vpc-has-connection-error-against-aws-api","title":"Lambda in VPC has Connection Error against AWS API"},{"tags":["html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265375,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187258,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187258_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265464,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187280,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187280_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265541,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187304,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187304_58422524"},{"owner":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":493,"user_id":9496199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7dwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramon de Vries","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9496199/ramon-de-vries"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571266495,"post_id":58422524,"comment_id":103187544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422524/opacity-property-affecting-some-elements-and-not-others#comment103187544_58422524"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11985562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBlnBnGPPp1EMs--jy9PzdVmyYrGoHbxFbeWewp-6w=k-s128","display_name":"Salief","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11985562/salief"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43,"user_id":12021198,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDzTzlbZsM4hfO2UGXh5tX7YoZ3hbCYjdHuVXDT=k-s128","display_name":"Phardin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12021198/phardin"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571274753,"creation_date":1571265202,"last_edit_date":1571274753,"question_id":58422524,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422524","body_markdown":"I&#39;m struggling to understand why when applying the opacity property to a div I have that holds a background-image the property seems to affect some text within my html but not others.\r\n\r\nHere is the basic layout of my markup.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    html,\r\n    body {\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      overflow: hidden;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .background_image {\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      /* content: &quot;&quot;;

IMHO implementing an interface should result in an *exact* implementation, not one which roughly matches?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422516/implementing-generic-interfaces-in-typescript","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Implementing generic interfaces in TypeScript"},{"tags":["c#"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10419,"user_id":2416958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w8lZr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2416958/stefan"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571265283,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187229_58422513"},{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265693,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187344,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187344_58422513"},{"owner":{"reputation":18911,"user_id":34092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10e78a68c6e32f9b8aeb47a968ebea9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mjwills","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34092/mjwills"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265780,"post_id":58422513,"comment_id":103187366,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null#comment103187366_58422513"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571265379,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187259,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187259_58422539"},{"owner":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571265406,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187268,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187268_58422539"},{"owner":{"reputation":6793,"user_id":302248,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b3bc412e2217f6ffc8c78a34ee34e1de?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/302248/sach"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571265456,"post_id":58422539,"comment_id":103187277,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#comment103187277_58422539"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571265397,"last_edit_date":1571265397,"creation_date":1571265321,"answer_id":58422539,"question_id":58422513,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58422539","body_markdown":"      Console.WriteLine(names[i].Names);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422513/not-able-to-initiate-the-listcustomer-the-value-of-customers-names-is-null/58422539#58422539","title":"Not able to initiate the List&lt;customer&gt;.

It only produces the incorrect results when p is the resulting value from the MongoDB call.\r\n\r\nI assume this implies something about the way the value is stored in the MongoDB call, as the property with type string is not recognized as a property until coerced through the parse(stringify(p)) call.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422481/json-stringify-shows-property-value-but-cannot-access-property-directly","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"JSON.stringify shows property value, but cannot access property directly"},{"tags":["java","c++","redirect","cmd","pipe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3258,"user_id":10957435,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/663773cb7f0bc33d3025eb2f9d47799c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chipster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10957435/chipster"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571265328,"post_id":58422474,"comment_id":103187244,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c#comment103187244_58422474"},{"owner":{"reputation":26082,"user_id":981744,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qJi4S.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Erwin Bolwidt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/981744/erwin-bolwidt"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571266206,"post_id":58422474,"comment_id":103187483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c#comment103187483_58422474"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":539,"user_id":882756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a3f7f896bb39fffe05701ded73d0df8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Christian Wolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/882756/christian-wolf"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571317517,"post_id":58433351,"comment_id":103207183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c/58433351#comment103207183_58433351"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571317720,"last_edit_date":1571317720,"creation_date":1571317389,"answer_id":58433351,"question_id":58422474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58433351","body_markdown":"The problem is that &quot;java -version&quot; responds on stderr, which must be redirected using 2&gt; not &gt;.\r\n\r\n**In conclusion**\r\n\r\nWrite output to file using &#39;2&gt; filename.txt&#39;\r\n\r\n    system(&quot;java -version &amp;&gt; temp.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n    std::ifstream fin(&quot;temp.txt&quot;);\r\n\r\n    std::string Result = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    std::string Line;\r\n\r\n    while(getline(fin, Line))\r\n        Result+=Line;\r\n\r\n    fin.close();\r\n\r\n(Thanks to Erwin Bolwidt)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422474/get-result-of-command-java-version-in-c/58433351#58433351","title":"Get result of command java -version in c++"}],"owner":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"last_editor":{"reputation":80,"user_id":10699646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NB20N.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mdre","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10699646/mdre"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571319094,"creation_date":1571264939,"last_edit_date":1571319094,"question_id":58422474,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422474","body_markdown":"I am trying to see whether or not the installed java version is good to run from c++. \r\n\r\nI looked everywhere, yet neither [pipes][1] nor redirecting the system() call using &quot;cmd + &gt; txtfile.txt&quot; seem to work with the output of &quot;java -version&quot;.\r\n\r\nI have no idea why, maybe the output stream can&#39;t be redirected?

You only need one reference to jQuery (making sure it is referenced *before* Bootstrap). Having multiple references will throw errors.\r\n\r\n - You also appear to reference Bootstrap twice (once from the CDN at the end of your `&lt;head&gt;`, and once at the start of your `&lt;head&gt;` with a local reference). Multiple Bootstrap references will also likely throw errors.\r\n\r\n - You also appear to be missing a reference to [PopperJS][1], which is a required dependency of Bootstrap 4.\r\n\r\n - `css\\splitslick\\style.css` is referenced with backslashes; you&#39;ll want forrward slashes.\r\n\r\n - Your local `script.js` and `style.css` come *before* Bootstrap&#39;s JS and CSS, which means that Bootstrap will overwrite your own code; you&#39;ll want your code to be loaded *last*.\r\n\r\nRemoving these additional references, and making sure that Bootstrap\r\n   comes *after* jQuery, PopperJS and Tether should fix your problem. Shifting your own JavaScript and CSS to the bottom of each respective section should cause it to override any conflicting Bootstrap code.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a modified `&lt;head&gt;` that should work. Take note of the following order:\r\n\r\n - Bootstrap 4 CSS -&gt; Plugins -&gt; Fonts -&gt; Custom CSS\r\n - jQuery -&gt; PopperJS -&gt; Tether -&gt; Bootstrap 4 JS -&gt; Custom JS\r\n   \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n      &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;title&gt;Printing Prime&lt;/title&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;icon&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot; href=&quot;img/favi.png&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/normalize/5.0.0/normalize.min.css&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick.min.css&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/slick-carousel/1.6.0/slick-theme.min.css&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans&amp;display=swap&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&#39;stylesheet prefetch&#39; href=&#39;https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto+Condensed:100&#39;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/splitslick/style.css&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;css/home.css&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha256-CSXorXvZcTkaix6Yvo6HppcZGetbYMGWSFlBw8HfCJo=&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/tether/1.4.0/js/tether.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-DztdAPBWPRXSA/3eYEEUWrWCy7G5KFbe8fFjk5JAIxUYHKkDx6Qin1DkWx51bBrb&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;script src=&quot;js/script.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://popper.js.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422465/why-is-that-when-i-add-in-the-following-bootstrap-my-page-become-white/58422587#58422587","title":"Why is that when I add in the following bootstrap my page become white?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12229230,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f76f59a61068d784a5c9f38faa283683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NhungN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12229230/nhungn"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571266136,"creation_date":1571264872,"question_id":58422465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422465","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a class project that required me to code a website that sells something.

You can use a colon to rename a part of your query. I added `articles: ` before your allMarkdownRemark. In the resulting JSON the allMarkdownRemark will now be called &#39;articles&#39;. You can see this in the forEach loop that now iterates over &#39;result.data.articles&#39;. I also added a query for the &#39;projects&#39; entity you want. Renaming them to articles and projects allows us to easily iterate over every article and every project, and create the correct pages for these entities.\r\n\r\nThe projects query is now a carbon copy of your articles query. In reality you should provide a query here that returns only the projects, but I don&#39;t know where you have those. Then create separate loops for the projects and the articles in which you create the correct pages.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nexports.createPages = ({ graphql, actions }) =&gt; {\r\n    const { createPage } = actions\r\n\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n        graphql(`{\r\n            articles: allMarkdownRemark {\r\n                edges {\r\n                    node {\r\n                        fields {\r\n                            slug\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            projects: allMarkdownRemark {\r\n                edges {\r\n                    node {\r\n                        fields {\r\n                            slug\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }`).then(result =&gt; {\r\n\r\n            // In this loop we only take the articles returned by the query, and\r\n            // pass them to the src/templates/article.js component.\r\n            result.data.articles.edges.forEach(({ node }) =&gt; {\r\n                createPage({\r\n                    // Rather than prepending every slug with &#39;/article&#39; in the\r\n                    // createNodeField call, you can add it here to get more\r\n                    // flexibility, and to allow different types to have different\r\n                    // path prefixes.\r\n                    path: `article/${node.fields.slug}`,\r\n                    component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/article.js`),\r\n                    context: {\r\n                        slug: node.fields.slug,\r\n                    },\r\n                })\r\n            })\r\n\r\n            // In this loop we do the same thing, only with the projects this\r\n            // time, and passing them to the project.js component I&#39;m assuming\r\n            // you have. I&#39;ve prepended the path with &#39;project/&#39; to separate\r\n            // the projects from the articles.\r\n            result.data.projects.edges.forEach(({ node }) =&gt; {\r\n                createPage({\r\n                    path: `project/${node.fields.slug}`,\r\n                    component: path.resolve(`./src/templates/project.js`),\r\n                    context: {\r\n                        slug: node.fields.slug,\r\n                    },\r\n                })\r\n            })\r\n\r\n            resolve()\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added some indentation to make things a little easier to reason about. I may have made some syntax errors along the way, so beware of that.\r\n\r\nI noticed that in your `onCreateNode` call, you set the slug of every markdown file to &#39;article/${slug}`. If your projects are also markdown files you should not do this, because it will also give your project markdown files slugs that start with &#39;/article&#39;. In the code above, I set the correct path in the createPage call, not in createNodeField.\r\n\r\nOne thing you have to bear in mind is that if you&#39;ve got both your articles as well as your projects as markdown files, your query is going to have a rough time telling them apart. The way I usually fix this is by adding a &#39;type&#39; field to the frontmatter. So in your case you&#39;d add: `type: article` to the frontmatter of all your articles, and `type: project` to all your projects. The frontmatter part is the part at the top of your markdown file, between the three dashes lines:\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n---\r\ntype: article\r\nname: something\r\netc, etc...\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can filter your markdown files like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ngraphql(`query {\r\n      projects: allMarkdownRemark ( filter: {frontmatter: { type: { eq: &quot;project&quot; } } } ) {\r\n        edges {\r\n          node {\r\n            fields {\r\n              slug\r\n            }\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }`);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will return only markdown files that have type project. Do the same thing for your articles. If you use Netlify CMS, you can add a hidden field to automatically add the correct type to help you filter.\r\n\r\nYou may want to consider changing the promise into an async/await call. This is optional, but in my opinion it makes things a lot easier to read. Check out gatsby&#39;s tutorial here https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-seven/#creating-pages for an example of async/await in the createPages API.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422460/creating-a-second-blog-template-on-gatsby/58423473#58423473","title":"Creating a Second Blog Template on Gatsby"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11513851,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-x2Wct_oc918/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdB3EC7i-90TGeE6hK9-Ni0n4kWFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Judo Paku","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11513851/judo-paku"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571274019,"creation_date":1571264839,"question_id":58422460,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422460","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a second blog template on my Gatsby site.

It ships with a default user name and password, and they you&#39;re on your own. Postgres.app is a nicely compiled version of Postgres that you can run by double-clicking, you&#39;ll need other tools (and knowledge) to take advantage of Postgres. As you&#39;ll have noticed, the UI for Postgres.app is pretty much a few buttons to configure a server, and to give you shortcuts to the logs, configuration files, and data. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use psql (as mentioned), or any of the other command line tools, they&#39;re embedded in the application&#39;s package. Right-click, open the package, open Contents, open Versions, open the version you use, and look in bin.\r\n\r\nIf you want a GUI tool, there are many options. Since you say Postgres.app, I&#39;ll assume macOS. You&#39;ve found Postico, SQLPro for Postgres is good, TablePlus is also good. Those tools have fairly uncluttered UIs. If you want or need more features, pgAdmin has a whole lot to offer, and it&#39;s free. I end up using Navicat a lot, even though it has a UI that screams &quot;Look Ma! I wrote it in Java!&quot; It gets a lot done. I&#39;d say that day-to-day on macOS, I use SQLPro most. But, really, it&#39;s largely a matter of taste. psql is quite powerful, and you&#39;ll find no short of help for that. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58422447/how-to-setup-a-password-for-postgresql-in-postgreapp/58429777#58429777","title":"How to setup a password for PostgreSQL in postgreapp?"}],"owner":{"reputation":367,"user_id":7065723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s8a0ALrnDfs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA1g/s9H64FJoboU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Venkateshreddy Pala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7065723/venkateshreddy-pala"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66860,"user_id":466862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d873f397779db38cd510d9ee5416fd43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mark Rotteveel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/466862/mark-rotteveel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571305959,"creation_date":1571264770,"last_edit_date":1571294798,"question_id":58422447,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58422447","body_markdown":"I am using postgresapp for the PostgreSQL and without password I was able to connect to the database and perform operations.

Maybe the compiler optimizes this away)\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n    println!(&quot;user: {:#?}&quot;, u1);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut if you really want to have two users point to the same name in memory (pretty sure you don&#39;t), there are a couple of options:\r\n\r\n- You can change `String` to `&amp;&#39;static str`. This however means that you have to specify it when you compile. (You can&#39;t have a user type in their name at runtime, and store it in user)\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    #[derive(Debug)]\r\n    struct User {\r\n        first: &amp;&#39;static str,\r\n        last: &amp;&#39;static str,\r\n        age: u32,\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    fn main() {\r\n        let u1 = User {\r\n            first: &quot;John&quot;,\r\n            last: &quot;Doe&quot;,\r\n            age: 22,\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        let u2 = User {\r\n            first: &quot;Mary&quot;,\r\n            ..u1\r\n        };\r\n        \r\n        println!(&quot;user: {:#?}&quot;, u1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n - You can use a `Rc` to keep track of the references to a piece of memory. This way you don&#39;t have to worry about lifetimes and who&#39;s owning what.
