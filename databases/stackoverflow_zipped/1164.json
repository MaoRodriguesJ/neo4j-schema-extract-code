It is not\r\n&gt; necessary for the source of the streaming engine to prove data in\r\n&gt; real-time. There may be latencies in data generation and handing over\r\n&gt; the data to the processing engine. There is no such option in Spark\r\n&gt; Streaming to work on the data using the event-time. It only works with\r\n&gt; the timestamp when the data is received by the Spark. Based on the\r\n&gt; ingestion timestamp, Spark Streaming puts the data in a batch even if\r\n&gt; the event is generated early and belonged to the earlier batch, which\r\n&gt; may result in less accurate information as it is equal to the data\r\n&gt; loss. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; On the other hand, Structured Streaming provides the functionality to\r\n&gt; process data on the basis of event-time when the timestamp of the\r\n&gt; event is included in the data received. This is a major feature\r\n&gt; introduced in Structured Streaming which provides a different way of\r\n&gt; processing the data according to the time of data generation in the\r\n&gt; real world. With this, we can handle data coming in late and get more\r\n&gt; accurate results.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; With event-time handling of late data, Structured Streaming outweighs\r\n&gt; Spark Streaming.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265565/is-windowing-based-on-event-time-possible-with-spark-streaming/58267559#58267559","title":"Is windowing based on event time possible with Spark Streaming?"}],"owner":{"reputation":448,"user_id":8248386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d94f508e3884802a1fc3f77b4c7c1c0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8248386/rim"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5116,"user_id":6933993,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8rS8O.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thebluephantom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6933993/thebluephantom"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58267559,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570446175,"creation_date":1570435376,"last_edit_date":1570446175,"question_id":58265565,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265565","body_markdown":"According to the Dataflow Model paper : A practical approach to balancing correctness, latency and cost in massive-scale, unbounded, out-of-order Data processing: \r\n\r\n&gt; MillWheel and Spark Streaming are both sufficiently scalable,\r\n&gt; fault-tolerant, and low-latency to act as reasonable substrates, but\r\n&gt; lack high-level programming models that make calculating event-time\r\n&gt; sessions straightforward.\r\n\r\nIs it always the case?

And if your queue happens to be a queue from the Java library, as opposed to a custom class, it also already has such a method.\r\n\r\nSee the documentation of [Queue#poll][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.\r\n\r\nSo instead of creating this method, you could just do\r\n\r\n    Incident head = incidentQueue.poll();\r\n    // instead of\r\n    Incident head = incidentQueue.getNextIncident();\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Optional ##\r\n\r\nLet me propose you a modern way of handling the case that you can not return a value because the queue is empty.\r\n\r\nThe old-style way is to return `null`, but this has many drawbacks. Since Java 8, we have `Optional` which was created exactly for that (see its [documentation][2]).\r\n\r\n\r\n    public Optional&lt;Incident&gt; poll() {\r\n        if (incidentQueue.isEmpty()) {\r\n            return Optional.empty();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Incident head = incidentQueue.element();\r\n        incidentQueue.remove();\r\n        return Optional.of(head);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Note ##\r\n\r\nI would also suggest to rename the incident variable to `incident` or `head` instead of `i`. Do not abbreviate variable names, except they are commonly known (like `http`) or it is common pattern (like `i`, `j`, `k` for loops or `a`, `b` for math operations). `i` would only be confusing here, as it is usually used as index variable `int i` in a loop.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Queue.html#poll()\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265561/cannot-resolve-symbol/58265654#58265654","title":"Cannot resolve symbol"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570436071,"creation_date":1570436071,"answer_id":58265722,"question_id":58265561,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265722","body_markdown":"You&#39;re duplicating existing `Queue` functionality for nothing.

However, coming from &quot;non-Spring background&quot;, I find it somewhat problematic to *magically* use before mentioned annotations for any code action.\r\n\r\nMy second approach would be an introduction of configuration class:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = &quot;hello&quot;)\r\npublic class DummyProperties {\r\n\r\n    private String first;\r\n    private String second;\r\n\r\n    // get/set omitted\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class FirstClient implements Client {\r\n\r\n    private String hello;\r\n\r\n    public FirstClient(String hello) {\r\n        this.hello = hello;\r\n    }\r\n    // do some stuff with hello\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class SecondClient implements Client {\r\n\r\n    private String hello;\r\n\r\n    public SecondClient(String hello) {\r\n        this.hello = hello;\r\n    }\r\n    // do some stuff with hello\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nJoining logic would be:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n@Component\r\n@EnableConfigurationProperties(DummyProperties.class)\r\npublic class ClientCreator {\r\n\r\n    private DummyProperties props;\r\n    public ClientCreator(DummyProperties props) {\r\n        this.props = props;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public Client create(boolean isSatisfied) {\r\n        // some custom check logic\r\n        if (isSatisfied) {\r\n            return new FirstClient(props.getFirst());\r\n        } else {\r\n            return new SecondClient(props.getSecond());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn&#39;t necessarily need to be a good flow.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations or additional ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265523/spring-configurationproperties-usage","title":"Spring - ConfigurationProperties Usage"},{"tags":["android","firebase"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59776,"user_id":5246885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LQSwr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Mamo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5246885/alex-mamo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570443082,"post_id":58265521,"comment_id":102902163,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265521/i-cant-receive-data-from-firebase-database-code-makes-problems#comment102902163_58265521"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12175174,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3dee296bbfa54c6ec11150c2f3d97fd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"yuyu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175174/yuyu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":5082285,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6346341a24fb90f9ac3fb4ef1136d564?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Markus Kauppinen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5082285/markus-kauppinen"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570440094,"creation_date":1570435178,"last_edit_date":1570440094,"question_id":58265521,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265521","body_markdown":"I am using Firebase to save info but when I want to access it, it doesn&#39;t let me though it shows me the info from the firebase.\r\n```\r\n    databaseCourses.addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {\r\n                    @Override\r\n                    public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot dataSnapshot) {\r\n    \r\n                        cList = new ArrayList&lt;course&gt;();\r\n                        for (DataSnapshot data : dataSnapshot.getChildren()) {\r\n                            course p = (course) data.getValue();\r\n                            cList.add(p);\r\n                        }\r\n                        cAdapter = new courseAdapter(Main2Activity.this, 0, 0, cList);\r\n                        lv.setAdapter(cAdapter);\r\n                    }\r\n```\r\nI expected it to create a ListView.

All of your application code belongs in a Docker image.  You never try to update the code or dependencies in a running container; instead, you build a new image that has the new code, and then replace the old container with a new one.\r\n\r\nSo for each source code repository, put a `Dockerfile` in its root directory (if there isn&#39;t one there already).  Whenever you have a change, run something like\r\n\r\n    docker build -t myorg/myapp:$(git rev-parse HEAD)\r\n    docker push myorg/myapp:$(git rev-parse HEAD)\r\n\r\nOn the system where you&#39;re actually deploying it, you can\r\n\r\n    TAG=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567\r\n    docker pull myorg/myapp:$TAG\r\n    docker stop myapp\r\n    docker rm myapp\r\n    docker run --name myapp ... myorg/myapp:$TAG\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of supporting software that can simplify this.  A _container orchestration_ tool can handle the stop-and-restart sequence for you; Docker Compose is a little lightweight for many production-level workloads, but you can just change the image tag in its `docker-compose.yml` and re-run `docker-compose up -d` and it will handle this for you.  You may want a private _Docker registry_ to hold the images, and a _continuous integration server_ to run these steps for you whenever there&#39;s a check-in.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of advantages to this setup.  It&#39;s obvious from the `docker ps` output what versions of code you&#39;re actually running.  If a deployment goes bad, you can very easily revert to the previous build.  It&#39;s very straightforward to set up a pre-production environment with an exact set of candidate builds; building tests against it is some work, but you can decide to just not deploy a given image if it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nAs an additional bonus here, your images can be smaller (for not needing a source-control tool) and you don&#39;t need to put credentials to access your source control in your production environment.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265455/is-it-good-practice-to-use-a-shell-script-to-do-git-pull-for-multiple-docker-c/58268098#58268098","title":"Is it good practice to use a Shell Script to do &#39;git pull&#39; for multiple Docker containers?"}],"owner":{"reputation":715,"user_id":4120583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/loMI2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Hikaru Shindo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4120583/hikaru-shindo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3992,"user_id":2745495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bbcd267235bab78ec6710ef6654ba87?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gino Mempin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2745495/gino-mempin"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570445541,"creation_date":1570434812,"last_edit_date":1570440726,"question_id":58265455,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265455","body_markdown":"I have a legacy project where there are multiple Docker containers in a server that are using code from the same git repository. \r\n\r\nCurrently, if there&#39;s an update on the code, I need to remote to each docker container then pull the code one by one. \r\n\r\nFor example, I need to run \r\n\r\n    docker exec -it {container_id} bash\r\n\r\nthen I execute the git pull command repeatedly. \r\n\r\nSo, I thought of creating a shell script to automatically update all Docker containers 1 time.

Specifically; there&#39;s no way for a task to block (so it uses no CPU time) until data arrives/changes and then unblock when data does arrive/change.\r\n\r\nFor communication between user-space and kernel you&#39;d have the same problem. E.g. user-space code modifies data in the &quot;shared with kernel&quot; memory, and the kernel doesn&#39;t know if/when that happened; so (to avoid the kernel wasting CPU time constantly polling the shared memory) user-space code has to use a normal kernel call to say &quot;Hey, look at the shared memory now!&quot;, but if you&#39;re using a normal kernel call anyway then you could just pass a pointer to the data without using shared memory.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with using shared memory for communication is security risks. Specifically, a task can see that data arrived/changed, validate the new data to make sure it&#39;s acceptable, then malicious attackers can change the data after it was validated, then the task can act on the &quot;validated&quot; data. A very simple example would be something like &quot;`if(new_value_in_shared_memory &lt; MAX_VALUE) { myPrivateArray[new_value_in_shared_memory]++;`&quot; (where the malicious attacker changes `new_value_in_shared_memory` after it was checked, tricking the task into modifying something that it shouldn&#39;t). For tasks that trust each other (e.g. a process communicating with an `fork()` of itself) this isn&#39;t a problem at all; and when participants don&#39;t trust each other (e.g. kernel doesn&#39;t trust user-space code) it&#39;s major pain (extremely easy to make a mistake and get pawned). The easiest way to guard against this kind of attack is to copy the data from the shared memory into a private buffer, then validate it (knowing that its impossible for attacker to modify the copy), then act on the data in the copy. This copying adds overhead and mostly ruins any performance advantages of shared memory.\r\n\r\nFor the &quot;user-space communicating with kernel&quot; case there are a few possible alternatives - the kernel can suspend all threads that can access the shared memory during the &quot;validate then use&quot; phase (which would be a performance disaster, especially for multi-CPU systems); and the kernel could do virtual memory management tricks (e.g. set the underlying pages to a &quot;page fault if user-space tries to modify it&quot; state) during the &quot;validate then use&quot; phase (which would be a performance disaster, especially for multi-CPU systems).\r\n\r\nNote that the same kind of &quot;modified after validated&quot; security risk occurs for &quot;kernel call accepts pointer to data from user-space&quot; and for &quot;kernel call relies on data from user-space task&#39;s stack&quot;. However; for both of these cases (which don&#39;t involve shared memory but do involve &quot;kernel accesses task&#39;s normal memory&quot;) typically the kernel doesn&#39;t actually access the data and only transfers it. For example, for a `write()` the kernel might forward the data to file system code (without touching the data itself), which might forward the data to a storage device driver (without touching the data itself), which might transfer the data to a hard drive (without touching the data itself).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265439/kernel-mode-user-mode-communication-via-shared-memory-without-using-system-thr/58267835#58267835","title":"Kernel mode - user mode communication via shared-memory without using system threads"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11507334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joe Toe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11507334/joe-toe"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":11507334,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joe Toe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11507334/joe-toe"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1570451961,"accepted_answer_id":58267835,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570542368,"creation_date":1570434742,"last_edit_date":1570542368,"question_id":58265439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265439","body_markdown":"I have learnt how to implement shared memory as a communication method between two user mode processes.

formula.\r\nIn my case, it’s `{DBInstanceClassMemory/magic_number}`.\r\n\r\nBut the numbers in the `max_connections` column look slightly awkward because they are actually calculated from a formula

connections allowed to an Amazon RDS MySQL DB\r\n&gt; instance is based on the amount of memory available for the DB\r\n&gt; instance class of the DB instance.

As\r\n&gt; shown in the preceding table, the formula produces connection limits\r\n&gt; that increase by 1000 as the memory doubles between progressively\r\n&gt; larger R3, R4, and R5 instances, and by 45 for different memory sizes\r\n&gt; of T2 instances. The much lower connectivity limits for T2 instances\r\n&gt; are because T2 instances are intended only for development and test\r\n&gt; scenarios, not for production workloads. The default connection limits\r\n&gt; are tuned for systems that use the default values for other major\r\n&gt; memory consumers, such as the buffer pool and query cache. If you\r\n&gt; change those other settings for your cluster, consider adjusting the\r\n&gt; connection limit to account for the increase or decrease in available\r\n&gt; memory on the DB

The UIImage will show up in the main.storyboard but when I run the app in simulator or on my iPhone everything shows up except the `UIImage`. \r\n\r\nWhat makes this frustrating is that I was able to make the same app work just fine based off a tutorial I did but my own isn&#39;t working.\r\n\r\nWhen I ran into this issue, I decided to first close Xcode and then open the project again, that didn&#39;t work. Then I decided since it isn&#39;t a very hard project to just start from the very beginning and make the app again. That resulted in the same problem, with the app up and running but no UIImages showing up.\r\n\r\nI then decided that maybe the problem was based off the number of images I had. The original tutorial app I made only had five images and that ran fine on both simulator and iPhone. My version first had 26 images, but I thought just for the sake of making this work I scaled it back to 5. No luck, still not working. \r\n\r\n    @IBOutlet weak var imageView: UIImageView!\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not sure if this is related to why the app isn&#39;t showing the UIImages but this is what is connected to the UIImage that I pulled into the `main.storyboard`.\r\n\r\n\r\n    func newBallImage() {\r\n            \r\n      randomBallNumber = Int.random(in: 0 ... 4)\r\n        \r\n      imageView.image = UIImage(named: ballArray[randomBallNumber])\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nI also thought that it could be related to my function but I&#39;m scratching my head because this is the exact same code I wrote for the tutorial app and that was working just fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI also added these pictures to show that the tutorial app I made shows my UIImage when running in simulator, but for whatever reason it does not appear in my version.

E.g. These boxes have a width of 32% each. The remaining width of 4% (i.e. 32 x 3 = 96%) will be used to create the space between the boxes and simulate margins. No need to remove margins on the first and last child!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMWrap eqWrap&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHM eq&quot;&gt;boo &lt;br&gt; boo&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHM eq&quot;&gt;shoo&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHM eq&quot;&gt;clue&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;paddingBlock&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;EQUAL HEIGHT COLUMNS WITH MARGINS IN MULTIPLE ROWS&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;Building on the above example, just give bottom margins to the boxes. Add a flex-wrap: wrap to the parent, so that boxes go to the next line when they run out of space in a &#39;row&#39;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMRWrap eqWrap&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;boo&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;shoo&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;clue&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;boo &lt;br&gt; boo &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;shoo&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;equalHMR eq&quot;&gt;clue&lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;paddingBlock&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;EQUAL HEIGHT COLUMNS WITH MARGINS IN MULTIPLE ROWS and VARIABLE NO OF BOXES&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;Add display:flex, flex-wrap: wrap to the parent and give a width to the boxes.

What *might* alter a plan is what you end up doing with that column, and what data you put into it.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I have a 10GB table with 10,000,000 rows and do:\r\n\r\n    alter table T add NEW_COL varchar2(1000);\r\n\r\nthat table is still exactly 10G in size. It will take just a long to scan, and the optimizer will most likely come up with identical execution plans for existing queries.\r\n\r\nBut lets say I now run\r\n\r\nupdate T set NEW_COL = rpad(&#39;x&#39;,1000);\r\n\r\nNow every row in my table is 1000 bytes larger.  (I&#39;m putting aside issues such as chaining etc here), which means my table is now 20GB in size. That can have a dramatic impact on plans (even for queries that do not access the new column) because the table size is larger - so scans become less attractive etc.\r\n\r\nExecution plans are driven are estimates of how much it will cost to execute a query in terms of CPU, storage access etc, not by the addition of new columns.\r\n\r\nHope this helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265384/how-to-generate-execution-plan-to-see-effect-of-new-column-before-actually-creat/58265639#58265639","title":"how to generate execution plan to see effect of new column before actually creating the new column on the table"}],"owner":{"reputation":50,"user_id":2649239,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/601b0e2091ac36fa0aafab8d214bf769?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ikirankumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649239/ikirankumar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570435677,"creation_date":1570434483,"question_id":58265384,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58265384","body_markdown":"how to extract execution plan for table with new column before actually adding new column to that table? \r\n\r\nIs it possible at all?

What am missing from the solution? The  Storage account has been created on portal and i am using connection string from portal, the container has been also created. Is there anything i should be in a position to add or modify? What could be reason for this error? i just want to understand it, maybe i am calling not valid name on my &#39;connectionString&#39;? Or Kindly please provide me with some idea around this as i am stuck to this problem for close 1 day with no help from internet. Feedback maybe highly appreciated and guidance, thanks as i am looking forward for more details to this problem.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265382/microsoft-azure-storageexception-the-specified-resource-name-contains-invalid-c","title":"Microsoft.Azure.StorageException: The specified resource name contains invalid characters"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","networking","amazon-ec2","subnet","availability-zone"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5303,"user_id":21962,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1be44d7f4826c609699c5a6d0493605?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"myron-semack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21962/myron-semack"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570483972,"post_id":58265381,"comment_id":102921173,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265381/are-aws-availability-zone-labels-the-same-across-time-users#comment102921173_58265381"},{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":11970350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--7EdAbNTUsY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc20u-4sfIJ3Qs5zx_907pSjmPPZw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ABC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11970350/abc"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5303,"user_id":21962,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1be44d7f4826c609699c5a6d0493605?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"myron-semack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/21962/myron-semack"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570599789,"post_id":58265381,"comment_id":102958187,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58265381/are-aws-availability-zone-labels-the-same-across-time-users#comment102958187_58265381"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2888,"user_id":4779904,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYIDr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dunedan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4779904/dunedan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2888,"user_id":4779904,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XYIDr.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dunedan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4779904/dunedan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570437072,"last_edit_date":1570437072,"creation_date":1570434743,"answer_id":58265440,"question_id":58265381,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265440","body_markdown":"Over time they&#39;re the same, but not across AWS account.
