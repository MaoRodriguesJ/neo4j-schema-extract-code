I run the above code (with the different pattern of course) on Eclipse and I get the expected output.

Which is a heavyweight component with full Servlet rules and classloader behaviors (re: classloader isolation).\r\n\r\nThis is often overkill for an embedded server.\r\n\r\nNext, if you rely on Annotations, then you&#39;ll have the added requirement for bytecode scanning of the classes you have, making the setup of your environment more complex.\r\n\r\nA more traditional setup on Jetty is to use `ServletContextHandler`, not `WebAppContext` and manually declare all of the Servlets and Filters and their mappings.\r\n\r\nThis makes startup very quick as well (suitable for a docker environment or microservices).   Think sub-second startup.  A 100ms startup is achievable with very little effort this way.\r\n\r\nIf you must stick with a war and WebAppContext, consider doing a build time scan of the war configuration and resources, then adding the jetty-quickstart metadata into your war.  That little piece of XML, plus the quickstart runtime will also let you have blazingly fast startup with no webapp discovery step.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58239026/how-should-i-load-servlets-from-web-xml-with-embedded-jetty/58242296#58242296","title":"How should I load servlets from web.xml with embedded jetty?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":6301200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d2bda47ea7e6eb46190f80960baa4c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"likeanowl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6301200/likeanowl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58242296,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570217883,"creation_date":1570201741,"question_id":58239026,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58239026","body_markdown":"I am trying to migrate my application from **tomcat** to **embedded jetty**.

I got this table from *Tabulator*, so it is not a simple HTML table. I already tried several things. I know the cell is `tableDataNested[0].checkbox`, because when I do `console.log(tableDataNested[0].checkbox)`, it will say &quot;Test&quot; in the console. But I need to put a checkbox in there, so I tried the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(tableDataNested[0].checkbox).html(&quot;&lt;input type=&#39;checkbox&#39;&gt;&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that still would not work.

the fashion you are trying it with a `SUMPRODUCT` it would look like:\r\n\r\n    =SUMPRODUCT((A4:A9=&quot;Football&quot;)*(B4:B9+D4:D9))\r\n\r\nAnd another fashion, to exclude a certain column from the range `B4:D9` could be:\r\n\r\n    =SUMPRODUCT((A4:A9=&quot;Football&quot;)*(COLUMN(B4:D9)&lt;&gt;3),B4:D9)\r\n\r\nBut another (possible better way) would be to use multiple `SUMIF`:\r\n\r\n    =SUMIF(A4:A9,&quot;Football&quot;,B4:B9)+SUMIF(A4:A9,&quot;Football&quot;,D4:D9)\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nTo explain the second formula; it does first check column A against your lookup value returning an array of `TRUE` and `FALSE` values. We then check our range of values `B4:D9` (might as well make that `B4:D4`) and only return `TRUE` in the matrix if it is not column number 3. Now we made our matrix, the second parameter can be the full range so `SUMPRODUCT` knows whichs values to pick up and add.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the formula returns 13 to me, not 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I was just wondering if the following functionality is possible, and if not how it could be implemented. \r\n\r\nI want to stream/yield certain instance attributes instead of updating them in-memory. \r\n\r\nCurrently we can do the following: \r\n```python\r\nclass Handler(osmium.SimpleHandler):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        osmium.SimpleHandler.__init__(self)\r\n        self.edge_and_nodes = [] \r\n    def way(self, w): \r\n        self.edge_and_nodes.append({&#39;edge_id&#39;: w.id, \r\n                                        &#39;nodes&#39;: [w.nodes[i].ref for i in range(len(w.nodes))]})\r\nh = Handler()\r\nh.apply_file(&quot;test.osm.pbf&quot;)\r\nprint(&quot;Edges and their connected nodes: {}&quot;.format(h.edge_and_nodes))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when dealing with large regions this is not scalable. \r\n\r\nI would like a way of yielding a dictionary object that includes WayIds and related NodeIds (as well as tags, etc) for every WayObject. Is this possible? \r\n\r\nI am looking for something like this: \r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass StreamHandler(osmium.SimpleHandler):\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        osmium.SimpleHandler.__init__(self)\r\n        self.edge_and_nodes = [] \r\n    def way(self, w): \r\n        yield {&#39;edge_id&#39;: w.id, \r\n               &#39;nodes&#39;: [w.nodes[i].ref for i

(WayObject) since that seems to be dealt with internally using the `apply_file()` method (and I can&#39;t seem to find the source code for that method). \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEdit: the source code

So the problem was not with crontab at all but was actually an issue with Python virtual environments. Using `source activate` was not working with crontab. The solution was to modify the shell script so that it directly uses the Python in the specified virtual environment. For example.. \r\n\r\n```\r\n#! /bin/bash\r\ncd /home/pi/scripts\r\n/home/pi/berryconda3/envs/myEnv/bin/python pyscript.py\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAlso I had logging done within Python but because it crashed early in the script they were never written so I incorrectly assumed the crontab was not executing correctly. I have since discovered that it is a very good idea when working with *crontab* to log what&#39;s going on directly from cron like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\n* * * * * /home/pi/bash/myshell.sh &gt;&gt; /home/pi/logs/cronlog 2&gt;&amp;1\r\n```\r\nThis way I could actually see what was going wrong (i.e. Python was throwing `ModuleNotFoundError`).\r\n\r\n[There&#39;s a much better answer on this here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3287038/cron-and-virtualenv) that is worth looking at. I&#39;ll mark this question as a duplicate.

There had to be a way to let the runtime know how the image was to be used, and those naming conventions were the only way. Nowadays, though, that&#39;s not needed; the images can have _any_ names, because they just go into slots of an Image Set. But Apple provides a shortcut so that you can easily _switch_ from using the app bundle to using the asset catalog, thus coming into the modern world.\r\n\r\n&gt; with iOS 13 and Xcode 11 we have the ability to add an alternate set of images for use in dark mode. Does anyone know of if there is a way to specify light / dark as part of the filename so that images automatically end up the light and dark slots\r\n\r\nYes, there is no such way. Apple long ago stopped adding naming conventions for further distinctions among image files in the app bundle itself, because now the asset catalog exists and it has slots. So obviously there is no app bundle naming convention for light/dark mode, which just started existing. There is no need for a shortcut because you were never using a naming convention to begin with. You don&#39;t need to come into the modern world because you&#39;re already in it. Just put the images in their slots. You _can_ automate that process, but mere naming conventions is not the way.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238989/xcode-11-asset-catalogue-naming-convention-for-dark-light-images/58239221#58239221","title":"Xcode 11, Asset catalogue naming convention for dark / light images?"}],"owner":{"reputation":12836,"user_id":164216,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JV1fz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fuzzygoat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/164216/fuzzygoat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58239221,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570202480,"creation_date":1570201590,"question_id":58238989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238989","body_markdown":"Previously images dragged into the Xcode asset catalogue could be named as follows ...\r\n\r\n    Rabbit@2x.png\r\n    Rabbit@3x.png \r\n\r\non releasing the drag these images were automatically assigned to the correct **2x** &amp; **3x** slots within the catalogue.\r\n\r\nNow with iOS 13 and Xcode 11 we have the ability to add an alternate set of images for use in dark mode.

`cmpxchg` instruction always puts the result in the `rax` register.

In case 2, you tell GCC to use an arbitrary register instead by using `r`, but you don&#39;t put anything in that register.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use `r`, you&#39;ll have to add a `mov` instruction to move the result from `rax` to that register (`movq %%rax, %0`). You&#39;d also have to tell GCC that the rax register is changed by the instruction, for example by adding it to the &quot;clobbers&quot; section of the `asm` statement.

of all, **https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/DontUseInlineAsm.**  There is basically zero reason to roll your own CAS, vs. using `bool __atomic_compare_exchange(type *ptr, type *expected, type *desired, bool weak, int success_memorder, int failure_memorder)` https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/_005f_005fatomic-Builtins.html.  This works even on non-`_Atomic` variables.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**`&quot;=r&quot;` tells gcc it can ask for the output in whatever register it wants, so it can avoid having to `mov` the result there itself**.  (Like here where GCC wants the output in RSI as an arg for printf).  And/or so it can avoid destroying the input it put in the same register.  That&#39;s the entire point of `=r` instead of specific-register constraints.\r\n\r\nIf you want to tell GCC that the register it picks for input is also the output register, use `&quot;+r&quot;`.  Or in this case since you need it to pick RAX, use `&quot;+a&quot;(expected)`.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s already syntax for making the compiler pick the same register for 2 constraints with separate variables for input and output, specifically matching constraints: `&quot;=r&quot;(outvar) : &quot;0&quot;(invar)`.\r\n\r\nIt would be a missed optimization if the syntax *didn&#39;t* let you describe a non-destructive instruction that could produce output in a different register from the input(s).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**You can see what GCC actually picked by using the constraint in a comment.**\r\n\r\nRemember that GNU C inline asm is just text substitution into your template.  The compiler literally has no idea what the asm instructions do, and doesn&#39;t even check they&#39;re valid.  (That only happens when the assembler reads the compiler output).\r\n\r\n        ...\r\n        asm volatile (\r\n        &quot;lock cmpxchgq %3, %1   # 0 out: %0  |  2 in: %2&quot; \r\n        : ...\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n\r\nThe resulting asm shows the problem very clearly ([Godbolt GCC7.4][1]):\r\n\r\n```\r\n        lock cmpxchgq %rsi, (%rsp)   # 0 out: %rsi  |  2 in: %rax\r\n        leaq    .LC0(%rip), %rdi\r\n        xorl    %eax, %eax\r\n        call    printf@PLT\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I used AT&amp;T syntax so your `cmpxchgq %reg,mem` would match the `mem,reg` operand order [documented by Intel][2], although both GAS and clang&#39;s built-in assembler seem to accept it in the other order, too.  Also because of the operand-size suffix)\r\n\r\nGCC takes the opportunity to ask for the `&quot;=r&quot;(expected)` output in RSI as an arg for printf.  **Your bug is that your template makes a wrong assumption that `%0` will expand to `rax`.**\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere are lots of examples of the lack of implicit connection between input and output that happen to use the same C var.  For example, you can swap 2 C variables with an empty asm statement, just using constraints.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45910530/how-to-write-a-short-block-of-inline-gnu-extended-assembly-to-swap-the-values-of\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(j:1,lang:c%2B%2B,source:&#39;%23include+%3Cstdint.h%3E%0A%0Auint64_t+atomic_cas(uint64_t+*+destination,+uint64_t+expected,+uint64_t+value)%7B%0A++++__asm__+volatile+(%0A++++++++%22lock+cmpxchgq+%253,+%251+++%23+0+out:+%250++%7C++2+in:+%252%22++:%0A++++++++%22%3Dr%22+(expected)+://%3C-----+I+changed+a+with+r+and+expected+GCC+understood+it+from+the+inputs+%0A++++++++%22m%22+(*destination),+%22a%22+(expected),+%22r%22+(value)+:%0A++++++++%22memory%22%0A++++)%3B%0A%0A++++return+expected%3B%0A%7D%0A%0A%23include+%3Cinttypes.h%3E%0A%23include+%3Cstdio.h%3E%0Aint+main(void)%7B%0A++++uint64_t+v1+%3D+10%3B%0A++++uint64_t+result+%3D+atomic_cas(%26v1,+10,+5)%3B%0A++++printf(%22%25%22+PRIu64+%22%5Cn%22,+result)%3B+++++++++++//prints+10,+the+value+before,+OK%0A++++printf(%22%25%22+PRIu64+%22%5Cn%22,+v1)%3B+++++++++++++++//prints+5,+the+new+value,+OK%0A%7D&#39;),l:&#39;5&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;C%2B%2B+source+%231&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),k:51.19843924191751,l:&#39;4&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,s:0,t:&#39;0&#39;),(g:!((g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:clang900,filters:(b:&#39;0&#39;,binary:&#39;1&#39;,commentOnly:&#39;0&#39;,demangle:&#39;1&#39;,directives:&#39;0&#39;,execute:&#39;1&#39;,intel:&#39;1&#39;,libraryCode:&#39;1&#39;,trim:&#39;1&#39;),lang:c%2B%2B,libs:!((name:boost,ver:&#39;171&#39;)),options:&#39;-O3++-fstack-protector-strong+-fpie&#39;,source:1),l:&#39;5&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;x86-64+clang+9.0.0+(Editor+%231,+Compiler+%231)+C%2B%2B&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),k:48.801560758082495,l:&#39;4&#39;,m:50,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,s:0,t:&#39;0&#39;),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:g74,filters:(b:&#39;0&#39;,binary:&#39;1&#39;,commentOnly:&#39;0&#39;,demangle:&#39;1&#39;,directives:&#39;0&#39;,execute:&#39;1&#39;,intel:&#39;1&#39;,libraryCode:&#39;1&#39;,trim:&#39;1&#39;),lang:c%2B%2B,libs:!((name:boost,ver:&#39;171&#39;)),options:&#39;-xc+-O3+-fstack-protector-strong+-fpie&#39;,source:1),l:&#39;5&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;x86-64+gcc+7.4+(Editor+%231,+Compiler+%232)+C%2B%2B&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),header:(),l:&#39;4&#39;,m:50,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,s:0,t:&#39;0&#39;)),k:48.801560758082495,l:&#39;3&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),l:&#39;2&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),version:4\r\n  [2]: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/cmpxchg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238986/why-does-my-rvar-output-not-pick-the-same-register-as-avar-input/58240044#58240044","title":"Why does my &quot;=r&quot;(var) output not pick the same register as &quot;a&quot;(var) input?"}],"owner":{"reputation":10696,"user_id":2786156,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fWMLm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"St.Antario","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2786156/st-antario"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58240044,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570220516,"creation_date":1570201584,"last_edit_date":1570209173,"question_id":58238986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238986","body_markdown":"I&#39;m learning how to use [`__asm__ volatile`][1] in GCC and came up with a problem.

In both of the cases the function code is the same and looks as\r\n\r\n       0x0000555555554760 &lt;+0&gt;:     mov    rax,rsi\r\n       0x0000555555554763 &lt;+3&gt;:     lock cmpxchg QWORD PTR [rdi],rdx\r\n       0x0000555555554768 &lt;+8&gt;:     ret \r\n\r\nII. The problem came when GCC inlined the `atomic_cas` so in the later case the correct value was not passed to the `printf` function. Here is the related fragment of `disas main`:\r\n\r\n\r\n    0x00000000000005f6 &lt;+38&gt;:    lock cmpxchg QWORD PTR [rsp],rdx\r\n    0x00000000000005fc &lt;+44&gt;:    lea    rsi,[rip+0x1f1]        # 0x7f4\r\n    0x0000000000000603 &lt;+51&gt;:    mov    rdx,rax ;  &lt;-----This instruction is absent in the Case 2.\r\n    0x0000000000000606 &lt;+54&gt;:    mov    edi,0x1\r\n    0x000000000000060b &lt;+59&gt;:    xor    eax,eax\r\n\r\n***QUESTION:*** Why does the replacing `rax`(`a`) with an arbitrary register (`r`) produce wrong result? I expected it worked in both of the cases?\r\n\r\nUPD.

Or is there another way of extracting the table?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y04X2.png\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/camelot-dev/camelot/issues","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238981/extracting-table-from-a-pdf-table-without-vertical-lines","title":"Extracting table from a PDF table without vertical lines"},{"tags":["java","android","sharedpreferences","preferences","shared"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":77,"user_id":9462397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XIQzDnmwnVk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGDc/YDiNNx5RsmU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"A.S.H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9462397/a-s-h"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570201644,"post_id":58238978,"comment_id":102850579,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238978/android-get-shared-preferences-of-another-application#comment102850579_58238978"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8591395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1087263721330193/picture?type=large","display_name":"MiBa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8591395/miba"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":77,"user_id":9462397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-XIQzDnmwnVk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGDc/YDiNNx5RsmU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"A.S.H","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9462397/a-s-h"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570202775,"post_id":58238978,"comment_id":102851104,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238978/android-get-shared-preferences-of-another-application#comment102851104_58238978"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8591395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1087263721330193/picture?type=large","display_name":"MiBa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8591395/miba"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8591395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1087263721330193/picture?type=large","display_name":"MiBa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8591395/miba"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570202512,"creation_date":1570201520,"last_edit_date":1570202512,"question_id":58238978,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238978","body_markdown":"Im trying to get some data from Word Readable Shared Preferences of another application. \r\n\r\nIm sure that other application Shared Preferences is World Readable and name is present.\r\n\r\nBut im retrieving empty string.\r\n\r\nHere is my code: \r\n\r\n```\r\npackage com.example.sharedpref;\r\nimport androidx.appcompat.app.AppCompatActivity;\r\nimport android.content.Context;\r\nimport android.content.pm.PackageManager;\r\nimport android.os.Bundle;\r\nimport android.widget.TextView;\r\nimport android.content.SharedPreferences;\r\n\r\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n    private TextView appContent;\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n        appContent = (TextView) findViewById(R.id.test1);\r\n        appContent.setText(&quot;Test Application\\n&quot;);\r\n        appContent.setText(getName(this));\r\n    }\r\n    protected String getName(Context context){\r\n        Context packageContext = null;\r\n        try {\r\n            packageContext = context.createPackageContext(&quot;com.application&quot;, CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY);\r\n            SharedPreferences sharedPreferences = packageContext.getSharedPreferences(&quot;name_conf&quot;, 0);\r\n            String name = sharedPreferences.getString(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;&quot;);\r\n        return  name; //HERE IS WHERE I PUT BREAKPOINT\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        catch (PackageManager.NameNotFoundException e) {\r\n            return null;\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is some debbug i retrevie from debbug mode:\r\n\r\nPicture here:\r\n![Name is redacted][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKvdO.png\r\n\r\n\r\nand piece of code from the app that im trying to access shared preferences: -\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /* access modifiers changed from: protected */\r\n    @SuppressLint({&quot;WorldReadableFiles&quot;})\r\n    public void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {\r\n        super.onCreate(bundle);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_welcome);\r\n        Editor edit = getApplicationContext().getSharedPreferences(&quot;name_conf&quot;, 0).edit();\r\n        edit.putBoolean(&quot;FIRSTRUN&quot;, false);\r\n        edit.putString(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Eddie&quot;);\r\n        edit.commit();\r\n        new DBHelper(this).getReadableDatabase();\r\n```\r\nPS.

However, I guess, you are looking for something to set the value to some xyz variable when you submit the data, right?\r\n\r\nYou can do this by two ways, these are:\r\n\r\n&gt;1. Using [onSubmitted Property][1]: This gives the value when the user is done editing the value in the textfield\r\n2. Using [TextEditingController][2]: Controls the text being edited.\r\n\r\n**Code using TextEditingController:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTextEditingController _controller = new TextEditingController();\r\n\r\nTextField(\r\n  controller: _controller \r\n)\r\n\r\n//suppose you have a button which will print the data of the textfield for on onPressed\r\nRaisedButton(\r\n onPressed: () {\r\n    //this will print the value you&#39;ve entered into the textfield\r\n    print(this._controller.text)\r\n    //change the value using setState here\r\n    setState((){\r\n        value_to_be_changed_variable = this._controller.text\r\n    })\r\n },\r\n child: const Text(&#39;Submit&#39;, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20))\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Code using onSubmitted Property:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nTextField(\r\n  onSubmitted: (value) {\r\n     //do the operation here with the help of setState()\r\n     setState((){\r\n        variable_value_to_be_changed = value\r\n     })\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope that&#39;d suffice your needs.

It is exactly the same.\r\n\r\nSo maybe a good solution for you would be to stop using `from &lt;xxx&gt; import *` or `import &lt;xxx&gt;`, which both import *all* symbols from the other module, but to import selected symbols in precisely controlled places.

From what I understand, the order of the import statements is not important. So why is this happening? Why does changing the order resolve the error?\r\n 2. Could this be because of the loop-like importing? Since I am importing the main file in the utility functions too.\r\n 3. If yes, then is it okay to define `print_parameter_header()` in the utility files? Although it would be redundant, is that a good practice?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238941/why-is-the-order-of-importing-files-resolving-a-nameerror","title":"Why is the order of importing files resolving a NameError?"},{"tags":["reactjs","xcode","react-native"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2145,"user_id":2316540,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f763842eb4cfb7e850fc3691e88083fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"muka.gergely","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2316540/muka-gergely"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570203320,"post_id":58238940,"comment_id":102851369,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238940/undefined-is-not-an-objectevaluating-packagejson-defaults-reactnative-rewritef#comment102851369_58238940"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6849681,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/552734951576794/picture?type=large","display_name":"Fei Long","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6849681/fei-long"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570201362,"creation_date":1570201362,"question_id":58238940,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238940","body_markdown":"Upgrading to react-native 60.0.0 and got errors.\r\nCan someone help?

your *ngFor loop, the array you are looping though is being piped.

I&#39;ve removed the implimentation that I tried to do with the filter to avoid confusion:\r\n\r\n```import { Component, OnInit, Injectable, Input } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\nimport { Observable } from &#39;rxjs&#39;;\r\nimport { Ipcidata } from &#39;../Shared/Ipcidata&#39;;\r\nimport { map, filter, switchMap } from &#39;rxjs/operators&#39;;\r\nimport { Ng2SearchPipeModule } from &#39;ng2-search-filter&#39;;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n@Component({\r\n  selector: &#39;app-system-status&#39;,\r\n  templateUrl: &#39;./system-status.component.html&#39;,\r\n  styleUrls: [&#39;./system-status.component.css&#39;],\r\n})\r\n\r\nexport class SystemStatusComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n\r\n  @Input() pciData: any;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nconstructor() {}\r\n  searchText;\r\n  p: number;\r\n  filteredValues : any;\r\n\r\n  ngOnInit() {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHere&#39;s the parent template, &quot;app-system&quot; is what I&#39;m trying to search through the values of :\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;ngx-spinner&gt;&lt;/ngx-spinner&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;section class=&quot;app-container&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;div class =&quot;card-container&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ng-container *ngFor=&quot;let system of pciData | paginate: { itemsPerPage: 180, \r\n      currentPage: p }; let i = index &quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&#39;cardboi&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;app-system [systemInput]=&quot;system&quot;&gt;&lt;/app-system&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/ng-container&gt;  \r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;pagination-container&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;pagination-controls class=&#39;paginator&#39; (pageChange)=&quot;p = $event&quot;&gt;&lt;/pagination-controls&gt; \r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/section&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nlastly, here is the child template, to which the search bar filter should only show what the user inputs as the hostname. This is essentially just a button that pops up more data about that host when clicked. Again, the point of this is only to show the buttons with a certain hostname.\r\n\r\n```&lt;div class=&#39;card shadow button-background&#39;&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;button  (click)=&quot;openDialog()&quot; [ngClass]=&quot;{\r\n    &#39;btn buttonGood&#39;:isValid(),\r\n    &#39;btn buttonDateAlert&#39;:isValid()==&#39;datewarning&#39;,\r\n    &#39;btn buttonAlert&#39;:isValid()==false\r\n  }&quot;&gt;{{systemInput.hostname.slice(0,13) | uppercase}}&lt;/button&gt;\r\n  \r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks again for anyone who can help me with this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238921/can-i-search-filter-through-a-child-component-angular","title":"Can I search filter through a child component?

phones got different screen size**, in your layout you are using fixed size on your view (fixed size is `android:layout_marginTop=&quot;474dp&quot;` for example) and the result is that what may look good on one screen (your android studio preview screen) will not look good on another screen (your actual phone).\r\n\r\nHow can you fix it - you can use

here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n**This will look like you want it to look but let`s explain what I did:**\r\n\r\n- I have used `app:layout_constraintHeight_percent=&quot;0.1&quot;` on the buttons to tell them to be equal in height to `10%` of the screen size (not fixed size dimensions).\r\n\r\n- On the same concept, I have also used `app:layout_constraintHeight_percent=&quot;0.4&quot;` so the image will be equal to `40%` of the screen size in height.\r\n\r\n- I have also used [Guidelines](https://constraintlayout.com/basics/guidelines.html) to better control the position of my buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YspIt.jpg\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about creating responsive layouts in [Support different screen sizes](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screensizes), [Barriers](https://constraintlayout.com/basics/barriers.html) and as mentioned above [Guidelines](https://constraintlayout.com/basics/guidelines.html) as well\r\n\r\nWith the above tools, you can create a responsive layout.\r\nYou don&#39;t have to use `ConstraintLayout` to achieve this, you have other options but I find it the most easy way to creat your layouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238920/android-dialog-wont-load-full-data/58239471#58239471","title":"android dialog won&#39;t load full

We&#39;re using a hash join because it&#39;s much faster.  Recently we found that occasionally the HASH join was returning the wrong value but we don&#39;t really know why.  A coworker went through and changed a column name in the HASH so we are now using a different name for the returned value and the column name from the HASH table (instead of Liab_ILF_Factor = ROUND(LIAB_ILF_Factor, .001) we&#39;re using Liab_ILF_Factor = ROUND(Liab_ILF_Fact, .001) and that seems to be working but just concerned that it happened in the first place and want to make sure we have actually fixed the underlying issue.

application is a payment facilitator, where our checkout process supports both redirect and iframe checkout. To prevent CSRF attacks we use standard MVC AntiForgeryToken implementation. However, small percentage of our checkouts fail with an error saying the AntiForgeryToken cookie is missing.\r\n\r\nFrom logs we summarized that those error occur only when user agent is either Mobile Safari or rarely Samsung browser, of varying versions and platform versions. \r\n\r\nWe cannot be certain that these errors occur only when embedded inside of an iframe, however we hadn&#39;t been able to reproduce these errors reliably from either redirected or embedded version.\r\nWhats more puzzling is that standard Safari and 3rd party cookies issues don&#39;t explain this either, because in all instances we can tell from logs that the ASP.NET_SessionId cookie is present.\r\n\r\nWe have tried setting the P3P header on the response:\r\n`HttpContext.Response.AddHeader(&quot;p3p&quot;, &quot;CP=\\&quot;IDC DSP COR ADM DEVi TAIi PSA PSD IVAi IVDi CONi HIS OUR IND CNT\\&quot;&quot;);` but that didnt solve it.\r\n\r\nAlso, we are certain that this happens for legit users too, not exclusively for malicious attackers (assuming any of them are malicious). And to make sure to state the obvious, all of these requests contain a HTTP form entry containing the `__RequestVerificationToken`, but no cookie.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, all of the logged errors state this: `The required anti-forgery cookie &quot;__RequestVerificationToken_L3Yx0&quot; is not present.` We were not able to explain the `_L3Yx0` appendix. To be clear though, the appendix is not the problem, or at least not the only one because we do not receive the cookie in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhat possible explanations are there for this weird behavior, and what can we do to prevent the issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238883/mobile-browsers-sometimes-dont-forward-antiforgery-token-cookie","title":"Mobile browsers sometimes dont forward antiforgery token cookie"},{"tags":["python","python-2.7","anaconda","python-venv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":453,"user_id":5113171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fg6CV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Milton Arango G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5113171/milton-arango-g"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570205273,"post_id":58238882,"comment_id":102852179,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238882/virtual-environment-with-python-3-7-4-not-created-in-anaconda-2#comment102852179_58238882"},{"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9695260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4140d0dc7a2d8aafaeb733617cf8cc6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user9695260","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9695260/user9695260"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":453,"user_id":5113171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fg6CV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Milton Arango G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5113171/milton-arango-g"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571036211,"post_id":58238882,"comment_id":103092468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238882/virtual-environment-with-python-3-7-4-not-created-in-anaconda-2#comment103092468_58238882"}],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9695260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4140d0dc7a2d8aafaeb733617cf8cc6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user9695260","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9695260/user9695260"},"last_editor":{"reputation":450,"user_id":9434323,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KnPIn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sterconium","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9434323/sterconium"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570204343,"creation_date":1570201200,"last_edit_date":1570204343,"question_id":58238882,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238882","body_markdown":"I am typing following command in Anaconda Powershell Prompt:\r\n\r\n    conda create -n test_env python=3.7.4 anaconda\r\n\r\nDuring installation of packages not all packages are installed and finally the following response is issued:\r\n\r\n    CondaMultiError: RuntimeError(&#39;maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object&#39;)\r\n\r\nThe current distribution of Anaconda installed is 2019.03 with Python 2.7 (I tried to install 2019.07 distribution with latest Python initially, but installation was failing with a response &quot;Failed to create menus&quot;).

it possible to determine at compile-time the exact base of a class template depending on its parameters?

are several ways to do this, none of them is easy. However, a quick and easy approach is to save the credentials in an external file on the server, let the php get the credentials from it and secure it with htaccess.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n1. Prepare your files :-\r\n========================\r\n  1. Create a folder on the server called &quot;_secure&quot;.\r\n  2. Create a file under &quot;_secure&quot; called &quot;creds.ini&quot; containing `username|password`.\r\n  3. Create a file under &quot;_secure&quot; called &quot;.htaccess&quot;.\r\n\r\n2. Secure your credentials :-\r\n============================\r\n\r\n  Inside your &quot;.htaccess&quot; file, add the following text :-\r\n\r\n    # Deny access to .htaccess\r\n    &lt;Files .htaccess&gt;\r\n    Order allow,deny\r\n    Deny from all\r\n    &lt;/Files&gt;\r\n    \r\n    # Disable directory browsing \r\n    Options -Indexes\r\n    \r\n    # Deny access to files with extensions .ini\r\n    &lt;FilesMatch &quot;\\.(ini)$&quot;&gt;\r\n    Order allow,deny\r\n    Deny from all\r\n    &lt;/FilesMatch&gt;\r\n\r\n3. Integrate with PHP :\r\n=======================\r\n\r\n  Inside your php, use the following code :-\r\n\r\n    $creds = explode(&#39;|&#39;, file_get_contents(&quot;creds.ini&quot;));\r\n    new PDO(DB_DSN, $creds[0], $creds[1]);\r\n\r\nYou have to customize the names and the php code according to your usage, these are just sample codes and names.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238853/providing-db-credentials-via-environment-and-not-hard-coded/58239313#58239313","title":"Providing DB credentials via environment and not hard coded"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":136831,"user_id":285587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uhHvv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Your Common Sense","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/285587/your-common-sense"},"last_editor":{"reputation":136831,"user_id":285587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uhHvv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Your Common Sense","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/285587/your-common-sense"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570204301,"last_edit_date":1570204301,"creation_date":1570203953,"answer_id":58239606,"question_id":58238853,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58239606","body_markdown":"Assuming your current Linux installation is using Apache as a web-server, you can configure environment variables in its configuration files (httpd.conf or .htaccess) like this\r\n\r\n    SetEnv DB_USER whatever\r\n\r\nIn case its Nginx, it will be \r\n\r\n    fastcgi_param DB_USER whatever;\r\n\r\nAfter that, it will be possible to access such values using `$_ENV` array like this\r\n\r\n    new PDO($dsn, $_ENV[&#39;DB_USER&#39;], $_ENV[&#39;DB_PASS&#39;]);\r\n\r\n(note that I would avoid storing entire DSN in the envieonment as it&#39;s too localized to PDO.

But before we can migrate it, they would like me to change the SQL credential configuration as stated above.\r\n\r\nI am current using the class provided in the PHP documentation comments found [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php#93178).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238853/providing-db-credentials-via-environment-and-not-hard-coded","title":"Providing DB credentials via environment and not hard coded"},{"tags":["sql","sql-update"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1075,"user_id":496038,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lO2Iq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pringi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/496038/pringi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570201487,"post_id":58238852,"comment_id":102850508,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238852/sql-update-run-column-come-back-to-initial-value#comment102850508_58238852"},{"owner":{"reputation":224,"user_id":3757755,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000520518503/picture?type=large","display_name":"Antonio Veneroso Contreras","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3757755/antonio-veneroso-contreras"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570202110,"post_id":58238852,"comment_id":102850800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238852/sql-update-run-column-come-back-to-initial-value#comment102850800_58238852"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":8077200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9078511cfcf4bbb999bef5ea619dbab6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Janny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8077200/janny"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570217967,"post_id":58238852,"comment_id":102856830,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58238852/sql-update-run-column-come-back-to-initial-value#comment102856830_58238852"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":8077200,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9078511cfcf4bbb999bef5ea619dbab6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Janny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8077200/janny"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1686,"user_id":11517179,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zH4UW.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"daShier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11517179/dashier"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570204115,"creation_date":1570201098,"last_edit_date":1570204115,"question_id":58238852,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58238852","body_markdown":"I am trying to update a column from a Table with SQL Update query, it gets update and show me the correct value updated when I run the select statement. but after sometime it come back to the initial value.

However I keep running into the same error when I try to code the example: \r\n\r\n```\r\nlet doc = new jsPDF();\r\n        doc.setFontSize(26);\r\n        doc.text(40, 40, &quot;First PDF with NativeScript using jsPDF!&quot;);\r\n        let dataUrl = doc.output(&#39;datauristring&#39;);\r\n        if(dataUrl) {\r\n            dialogs.alert({\r\n                title: &quot;jsPDF - Base64&quot;,\r\n                message: dataUrl,\r\n                okButtonText: &quot;Copy to Clipboard&quot;\r\n            }).then(() =&gt; {\r\n                clipboard.setText(dataUrl)\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI keep getting following error: \r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; NativeScript encountered a fatal error: ReferenceError: Can&#39;t find\r\n&gt; variable: window\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought these lines would take care of this error but they don&#39;t, I tried to add this in the component I was trying to use the pdf generation and also in the main.ts and in the app.component.ts:\r\n\r\n```\r\nglobal[&#39;window&#39;] = {\r\n    &#39;document&#39;: {\r\n        &#39;createElementNS&#39;: () =&gt; { return {} }\r\n    }\r\n};\r\nglobal[&#39;document&#39;] = {\r\n    &#39;createElement&#39;: (str) =&gt; { return {} }\r\n};\r\nglobal[&#39;navigator&#39;] = {};\r\n//Imports\r\nvar base64 = require(&#39;base-64&#39;);\r\nimport * as jsPDF from &#39;jspdf&#39;;\r\nglobal[&#39;btoa&#39;] = (str) =&gt; {\r\n    return base64.encode(str);\r\n};\r\nglobal[&#39;atob&#39;] = (bytes) =&gt; {\r\n    return base64.decode(bytes);\r\n};\r\nglobal[&#39;u8&#39;] = {};\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever I keep getting the same error and can&#39;t find any differences between my code and the [working example playground](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-ng&amp;id=OGrw9s&amp;v=8&amp;_ga=2.202298769.1418875902.1570200843-1896458786.1567691562). I also added all libraries and the plugin that was needed to make this example work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm install jspdf --save\r\nnpm install @types/jspdf --save\r\nnpm install base-64 --save\r\nnpm install utf8 --save\r\ntns plugin add nativescript-clipboard\r\n```\r\n\r\n**EDIT** I also tried to downgrade these node modules to the exact same version that the playground was using. Still same error.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT** If I use the node modules the same way as in the playground, so I am just adding them to the app directory, it works as it is supposed too. Still this feels as a bad work around, is there another solution?\r\n\r\nDoes someone see what I am doing wrong or what I am missing here?

This is my first Angular application and I&#39;m running Angular 8\r\n\r\nEverything has been going reasonably well so far, but I&#39;ve just encountered this error and I&#39;m not sure how to get around it.\r\n\r\nMy application calls to an API which returns a data set that the view relies on. One particular property is rendering correctly on the page, however the console reads\r\n\r\n&gt; theComponent.html:29 ERROR TypeError: Cannot read property &#39;relevantObject&#39;\r\n&gt; of undefined.\r\n\r\nTechnically speaking, this error doesn&#39;t seem to be causing any issues. The data is rendering just fine and I can even perform pipe operations to make it display as currency (as intended). But as a general matter of course, I want to produce an application with as few errors as possible (of course) nut I&#39;m not sure even what is causing this and I suspect it&#39;s an Angualr Faux pas on my part due to inexperience. Any help appreciated\r\n\r\nThe .ts file \r\n\r\n```Typescript\r\nthis._http.getData(this.id,this.pid, this.name).subscribe(apiData =&gt; {\r\n    this.data = apiData ;\r\n    console.log(this.data) //For debugging\r\n    //this.ref.detectChanges();//Attempted fix for this issue using ChangeDetectorRef\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\ncomponent.html (line 29)\r\n```HTML\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;col-6 value&quot;&gt;\r\n  {{ data.relevantObject[0].value |currency:&#39;EUR&#39;:&quot;symbol&quot; }}\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n(The API returns two arrays: one called relevantObject and the other irrelevantObject. I mean to reference relevantObject )\r\n\r\nTo clarify, the data is rendering perfectly onscreen with multiple different test files, however the console error still presents. Any further details please ask. Thank you.\r\n\r\nEdit: This question differs from the question marked as its duplicate. The question linked is asking why the user is getting the type error and how to resolve that error in its standard form. This question relates to strange behaviour of an error appearing where one is clearly not needed, as the data is rendering correctly.
