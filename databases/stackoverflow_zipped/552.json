Due to the topology (node count) change between the two DCs, avoiding streaming the data in isn&#39;t possible AFAIK. \r\n\r\n&gt; Our new DC is going to be smaller (6 nodes) for the time being\r\n\r\nThe typical process isn&#39;t going to work due to token alignment on the nodes being different (new cluster&#39;s ring will change). So just copying the existing SSTables wont work, as the nodes that hold those tables, might not have the tokens corresponding to the data in the files and so C* wont be able to find said data.\r\n\r\nBulk loading the data to the new DC is out too, as you&#39;ll be overwriting the old data if you re-insert it. \r\n\r\nTo give you an overview of the process if you were to retain the topology:\r\n\r\n1. snapshot the data from the original DC\r\n2. Configure the new DC. It&#39;s extremely important that you set initial_token for each machine. You can get a list of what tokens you need by running `nodetool ring` on the original cluster. This is why you need the same number of nodes. As importantly, when copying the SSTable files over, you need the files and the tokens to be from the same node.\r\n3. ship the data to the new DC (Remember if the new node 10.0.0.1 got it&#39;s tokens from 192.168.0.100 in the old dc, then it also has to get it&#39;s snapshot data from 192.168.0.100).  \r\n4. Start the new DC and ensure both DCs see eachother ok.\r\n5. Rebuild and repair `system_distributed` and `system_auth` (assuming you have authentication enabled)\r\n6. Update client consistency to whatever you need. (Do you want to write to both DCs? From your description sounds like a no so you might be all good). \r\n7. Update the schema, ensure that you&#39;re using `NetworkTopologyStrategy` for any keyspce that you want to be shared, then add some replication for the new DC.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ALTER KEYSPACE ks WITH REPLICATION = { &#39;class&#39; : &#39;NetworkTopologyStrategy&#39;, &#39;oldDC&#39; : 3, &#39;newDC&#39;:3 };\r\n```\r\n\r\n8.

The new DC is mostly meant as a live-backup/failover and will not be the primary cluster for writing, generally speaking.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409127/cassandra-shipping-disk-to-new-dc-in-order-to-sync-50tb-of-data","title":"Cassandra: Shipping Disk to New DC in order to sync 50TB of data"},{"tags":["ios","swift","networking","callback"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1688,"user_id":2142112,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8ydRk.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Samuel Noyes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2142112/samuel-noyes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571217482,"post_id":58409361,"comment_id":103163302,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409126/loop-through-array-checking-each-element-with-networking-call-callback-function/58409361#comment103163302_58409361"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1544,"user_id":5060151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YQqLg4zqyWs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/JGtdfZ8gHcc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arik Segal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5060151/arik-segal"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571215883,"creation_date":1571215883,"answer_id":58409361,"question_id":58409126,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58409361","body_markdown":"The classic solution for this is using dispatch-group\r\nhttps://developer.apple.com/documentation/dispatch/dispatchgroup\r\n\r\nThere are many code examples for this.

Basically I want to create a messaging conversation with a specific user, but only if a conversation with that user doesn&#39;t already exist.  I am looping through an array of conversations, and for each conversation I fetch the identity of the other user via a call to my backend.  However, if no conversation is found with a particular user, then I want to create a new conversation.  This is what I am doing:\r\n\r\n    for convo in convos {\r\n        HTTPManager.getOtherUserFromConversation(conversation: convo, success: { (otherUser) in\r\n            if desiredUser == otherUser {\r\n                //Found the desired conversation, so bring the user \r\n                //to it instead of creating a new one\r\n            }\r\n        }, failure: {\r\n            //Networking failure\r\n        })     \r\n    }\r\n    //IF WE DIDN&#39;T FIND IT, CREATE A NEW CONVERSATION HERE\r\n\r\nI have thought of making a boolean value called &quot;found&quot; and setting it to `true` if we find the desired conversation, but I don&#39;t know how to wait until the last callback has executed before checking this boolean in order to avoid calling the check too early.

Well, wall clock time is easy to get, but you don&#39;t really have a chance to know whether hibernation happened or not.\r\n\r\n*However...*\r\n\r\nIf your process is a set of discrete steps, you could do something like the following\r\n\r\n    List&lt;Duration&gt; durations = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    for(Step step : steps) {\r\n        Instant stepStart = Instant.now();\r\n        process(step);\r\n        durations.add(Duration.between(stepStart, Instant.now()));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    long totalMillis = durations.stream()\r\n        .mapToLong(Duration::toMillis)\r\n        .filter(ms -&gt; ms &lt; 1000)   // Cut off limit, to disregard hibernate steps\r\n        .sum();\r\n\r\nThis times each step separately, and if the time for a step takes more than 1 second, it&#39;s not taken into account in the total. You could also use an &quot;average&quot; time for those steps, so the end result would be a bit more realistic (of course this depends on the number of steps, the assumed runtime of a single step, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis only works if there is a good limit to what is &quot;too much&quot; time, and it provides a less accurate result. If you&#39;re doing something with `BigInteger`, it&#39;s likely that steps with larger values take more time, so a single cutoff value would not work (although you could consider some kind of dynamic cutoff value, based on the input).\r\n\r\nCheapest, easiest and best solution: run the code on a server.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409117/how-to-measure-exact-execution-time-for-a-process-method-that-gets-frequently-in/58409791#58409791","title":"How to measure exact execution time for a process/method that gets frequently interrupted?"}],"owner":{"reputation":322,"user_id":10138416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdY1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LiNKeR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10138416/linker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":322,"user_id":10138416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OdY1A.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LiNKeR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10138416/linker"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571217184,"creation_date":1571215121,"last_edit_date":1571215585,"question_id":58409117,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58409117","body_markdown":"Currently this is how I get time elapsed for a process to get completed. \r\n\r\n    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n    process();\r\n    long end = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n    long duration = stop - start;\r\n    System.out.println(duration);\r\n\r\nThe problem I am facing currently is the `process()` gets interrupted(paused) by my pc&#39;s hibernation whenever there&#39;s no power(My work environment is outside so I have to be on battery) so that it can continue whenever I restart the pc when plugged.

shows in the bottom left UTF-8 when I open ASCII .raw files and UCS-2 Little Endian when open binary decompressed .raw files.&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is normal, UTF-8 is a **text** encoding, it simply associates a sequence of bytes to some character. Raw binary files don&#39;t have a fixed structure or an encoding, because they contain binary data: think, for example, of the difference between the string `&quot;3.1415926535&quot;` (that&#39;s 12 bytes in UTF-8) and the raw float binary representation of that value (which fits in 4 bytes). If you interpret the &quot;raw&quot; 4 bytes of the float as text you&#39;ll either get some garbage text output or a unicode decode error.  For raw files, the specific data format ad the meaning of each byte is specified by the software that generates them.\r\n\r\nNormally, you should look up the LTSpice raw file specification, understand how data is arranged and write yourself a parser for that. But since this is python, [someone already did that for you and made a package you can install via `pip`](https://pypi.org/project/ltspice/), look up that package and its examples, it should be pretty straightforward to use.\r\n\r\n_______________\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n\r\nAt [this link](https://ez.analog.com/design-tools-and-calculators/f/q-a/107457/ltspice-raw-data-format) they state the raw binary format is not officially disclosed and may chane anytime (although it hasn&#39;t for the last 15 years).\r\n\r\nThe format itself is a UTF-16 header followed by raw binary data.\r\nWhen you say:\r\n\r\n&gt; This is what I have currently in .raw file from LTSpice (After text &quot;Binary:&quot;): [...]\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the raw data (decoded at UTF-16, which, as you see, is nonsense in text). That raw data is a packed list of the variable&#39;s values **in the order defined in the header**, repeating for as many time points as you have in the data. Time is encoded in **double** (i.e., 8 bytes), anything else -unless you force it to double too - is in **float** (4 bytes).\r\nWhat you should do, then, is:\r\n \r\n   1) Parse the variables list and compute how long is one record (e.g., 8 + 4*num_of_variables)\r\n \r\n   2) take the byte data from the &quot;Binary&quot; string until the end of the file, \r\n and split it in chunks of the length you get at step 1\r\n\r\n   3) interpret the bytes in the record accordingly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409079/how-to-decode-compressed-binary-raw-files-from-ltspice-with-python/58409240#58409240","title":"How to Decode Compressed Binary .RAW Files from LTspice with python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":89,"user_id":10631916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fSCFAAbftMM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/q3wviQdPQ-c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"slobokv83","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10631916/slobokv83"},"last_editor":{"reputation":89,"user_id":10631916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-fSCFAAbftMM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/q3wviQdPQ-c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"slobokv83","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10631916/slobokv83"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571387297,"last_edit_date":1571387297,"creation_date":1571225167,"answer_id":58412191,"question_id":58409079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58412191","body_markdown":"The header of the .RAW binary file from LTSpice could be decoded with UTF-16. If one tries to convert a whole binary RAW file, then only the header will be converted to text. The last characters successfully converted to text with UTF-16 are &quot;Binary:&quot;. After this, one should get &quot;Chinese symbols&quot; or something else that is not readable.\r\n\r\nI used a hex editor and compared both - RAW ASCII file and RAW binary file for the same electric circuit. In the ASCII file, one could find &quot;Values:&quot; instead of &quot;Binary:&quot;, and after that decimal values. So, it is possible to compare binary code with a hex editor and real values in the RAW ASCII file.\r\n\r\nAfter comparison, I successfully decoded a RAW binary file. Everything written below is in hex. I had 6 variables.\r\n\r\n1. After &quot;Binary:&quot;, there are always 3 bytes: 00 0A 00;\r\n2.

In the Control panel of LTSPice, there is a possibility to switch between ASCII and binary compression. ASCII is readable without a problem, but it has drawbacks in size and performance, and that&#39;s the reason why I want to use binary compression. There is a possibility to select 2nd order compression, and that&#39;s the target.\r\nLTSpice gives as output .raw files, and ASCII file has values of voltages and currents, but in a binary file, there are symbols that I couldn&#39;t decode.\r\n\r\nFirst I tried to open .raw files with notepad++. Notpad++ shows in the bottom left UTF-8 when I open ASCII .raw files and UCS-2 Little Endian when open binary decompressed .raw files.\r\nI tried with different encoding such as UTF-16le, ISO-8859-1...actually I print all codecs and tried with them:\r\n```\r\nimport codecs\r\nprint(dir(codecs))\r\n```\r\nAlso, I tried without BOM. I found this and it gives no results for me:\r\n```\r\nimport codecs\r\nencoded_text = open(&#39;Circuit_binary_Transient.raw&#39;, &#39;rb&#39;).read()    #should read in binary mode to get the BOM correctly\r\nbom= codecs.BOM_UTF16_LE                                      #print dir(codecs) for other encodings\r\nassert encoded_text.startswith(bom)                           \r\nencoded_text= encoded_text[len(bom):]                         #strip away \r\ndecoded_text= encoded_text.decode(&#39;utf-16le&#39;)\r\nprint(decoded_text)\r\n```\r\nI found that Zlib is common compression and I tried to find out on which positions in my file I have compression, but whitout results.\r\nI used:\r\n```\r\nimport zlib\r\nfrom glob import glob\r\n\r\ndef zipstreams(filename):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;Return all zip streams and their positions in file.&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    with open(filename, &#39;rb&#39;) as fh:\r\n        data = fh.read()\r\n    i = 0\r\n    while i &lt; len(data):\r\n        try:\r\n            zo = zlib.decompressobj()\r\n            yield i, zo.decompress(data[i:])\r\n            i += len(data[i:]) - len(zo.unused_data)\r\n        except zlib.error:\r\n            i += 1\r\n\r\nfor i, data in zipstreams(&quot;Circuit_binary_Transient.raw.raw&quot;):\r\n    print (i, len(data))\r\n```\r\nI always get 0 for len(data).\r\n\r\nI found this script, but without the implementation of binary .raw files decoding:\r\n http://www2.ee.unsw.edu.au/~tlehmann/ltspy.py  \r\nAlso, I found the solution for Matlab, LTSpice2Matlab by Paul Wagner (ltspice reader for Matlab), but I need it for python, and from that particular script I can&#39;t find which encoding is used. I found that for binary decompressed files Paul Wagner used interpolation to get more points and then to convert to a readable format.\r\n\r\nActually, I used this code to read .raw files:\r\n```fo = open(&quot;Circuit_binary_Transient.raw&quot;,&quot;rb&quot;)\r\ndata = fo.read() # Binary data read\r\nfo.close()\r\nline = str(data, encoding=&#39;utf-16le&#39;)\r\nprint(line)\r\n```\r\nWhen I used ASCII .raw files and UTF8 then I have text at the end, but when I used binary compressed .raw files I cant find how to decode file in readable format.\r\n\r\nThis is what I have currently in .raw file from LTSpice (After text &quot;Binary:&quot;):\r\n\r\n```\r\n栋㲚朎㲚鸞㕼鸞㕼鸞땼䕘퇠≄뻕襾㷨⁄㷨⡜㚾⡜㚾⡜뚾䕘퇠≄㻥䏨㹔ᙘ㹓㜬㜬뜬岓逇Ⳡ㻵◲㻇㯋㻃㞟㞟랟ጟ箽㼄籼㼯덌㼩Ӏ㠋Ӏ㠋Ӏ렋괄蝄㼎ڕ㽦럍㽢먵㠹먵㠹먵령귴脍侧㼑з㽴鍰㽲럜㡆럜㡆럜롆쵺튆㼒㽺땺㽹迀㡌迀㡌迀롌偵姏䰦㼔㽾枎㽽雈㡏雈㡏雈롏䰼ᬇⅤ㼖쵅㽿ᦊ㽾⢖㡐⢖㡐⢖롐暾좳죯㼗챭㽼錒㽺䕈㡍䕈㡍䕈롍얳✀礦㼚嘻㽰㽫㿃㡁㿃㡁㿃롁먬쬥㼞㽉뙵㽁낁㠞낁㠞낁렞袨�봜㼢睿㻔瘵㻄㞠㞠랠嘈䆬흞㼦㷧븥譻븠蒱뜃蒱뜃蒱㜃빝袏噥㼪뼝뼙㼆럼㼆럼㼆㟼玵嬆㼬ﵠ뽐】뽏멬렩멬렩멬㠩떋Ҕ덭㼭葔뽩뽨챢렾챢렾챢㠾넼ꧼ㼮쏐뽵뼃뽵傴롉傴롉傴㡉뮷惵㼯툡뽻뽻婇롎婇롎婇㡎�ﶻሣ㼰姢뽿ᚶ뽿롐롐㡐誔\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect to decode and read this, and I suppose that I should get the same as in ASCII .raw files, such as:\r\n```\r\n0       0.000000000000000e+000  \r\n\t1.884843971540818e-002  \r\n\t1.884796850054908e-002  \r\n\t9.423984250366810e-007  \r\n\t9.423984250274539e-007  \r\n\t-9.423984250328532e-007  \r\n1\t\t3.951925877448456e-008  \r\n\t1.959322256186405e-002  \r\n\t1.959271263253092e-002  \r\n\t9.796356316741367e-007  \r\n\t9.796356316265457e-007  \r\n\t-9.796356317259836e-007  \r\n2\t\t1.185577763234539e-007  \r\n\t2.108275522427772e-002  \r\n\t2.108216492289399e-002  \r\n\t1.054108246213077e-006  \r\n\t1.054108246144700e-006  \r\n\t-1.054108246245633e-006\r\n```  \r\n\r\nI will appreciate any help.

It&#39;s similar to whatsapp where different days have a little header showing the date. I did that by making a section for each separate date and showing the date in the section header.  \r\n\r\nCells show the name of the sender if the previous message was from a different sender. So if  \r\n\r\n - Message 1 is from Alice  \r\n - Messages 2 and 3 are from Bob  \r\n - Messages 4 and 5 are from Alice  \r\n\r\nthen messages 1, 2 and 4 will show the sender name. This was easy enough by just setting a bool on the message model in the mapping process after fetching them from the api. The cell checks for this bool and either sets or doesn&#39;t set the sender name label text.  \r\n\r\nI have to change the space between cells depending on this too. If a cell doesn&#39;t show the sender name, e.g. it is from the same sender as the previous message, it should have less margin between itself and the previous message. If the cell is the topmost cell in the section the margin should remain as is.  \r\n\r\nI tried overriding `layoutSubviews` like this:  \r\n\r\n    override func layoutSubviews() {\r\n        super.layoutSubviews()\r\n        bounds = bounds.inset(by: UIEdgeInsets(top: topInset, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhere `topInset` is a CGFloat that I set in the cell dequeue like this:  \r\n\r\n    cell.topInset = item.isSenderSameAsPrevious &amp;&amp; indexPath.row &gt; 0 ? 10 : 0  \r\n\r\nWhere `item` is my message model.  \r\n\r\n#The problem:  \r\n\r\nMessage 1 has a sender name and a default margin to its top (the section header), message 2 is from the same sender and doesn&#39;t have a sender name and a smaller margin to its top (message 1).  \r\nHowever, message 3 is also from the same sender, it doesn&#39;t have the sender name (so I know the bool is set correctly) but it has a default margin to its top (message 2).  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m assuming that setting the inset like I did (which I got from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53324309/11312049)) is not working as intended because it simply shifts the cell&#39;s contentView up. What I need is that each subsequent message from the same sender has a small margin to its predecessor until a message from a different sender comes in between or a message is on a different day.

is my first time with thymeleaf and I got across a strange problem that I can&#39;t seem to get around. A minimal sample:\r\n\r\nConsider the following Controller mapping to list all users from a database:\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/users&quot;)\r\n    public String listUsers(Model model) {\r\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;users&quot;, userRepository.findAll());\r\n        return &quot;users&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nInside the users view, I want to list the users and for each of them I want to add a button to get the details for that particular user:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n      &lt;thead&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n      &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n      &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n        &lt;form th:each=&quot;user : ${users} th:action=&quot;@{/user}&quot; th:object=&quot;${user}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;td th:text=&quot;${user.getUserName()}&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;\r\n            &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Details&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n          &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n      &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nSo, since users is a List, my original idea was to create a form for each user in that list, and bind the current ${user} to th:object. Then in the controller mapping for the details (since this might have been changed in the meantime):\r\n\r\n    @PostMapping(&quot;/user&quot;)\r\n    public String userDetails(@ModelAttribute User user, Model model) {\r\n      model.addAttribute(&quot;user&quot;, userService.findUserById(user.getId()));\r\n      return &quot;userDetails&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow my problem is that it doesn&#39;t work. The ModelAttribute is null in the controller. I&#39;ve been reading thymeleaf&#39;s documentation on forms but can&#39;t figure out why I can&#39;t post the user from the current iteration without adding all of the user attributes in hidden fields to the form. I might by trying to do something completely insane, but I don&#39;t know honestly... Any tips for me? :)\r\n\r\n\r\n@Update:\r\nAfter countless rewrites I settled with the following:\r\n\r\n    @GetMapping(&quot;/users/{id}/details&quot;)\r\n    public String user(@RequestParam Integer userId, Model model) {\r\n        model.addAttribute(&quot;user&quot;, userService.findUserById(userId));\r\n\r\n        return &quot;userDetails&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMeaning I only want to get the user&#39;s ID. For this, I created the following template:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form th:each=&quot;user: ${users}&quot; th:action=&quot;@{/users/{user_id}/details(user_id=${user.id}})}&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;td th:text=&quot;${user.userName}&quot;&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;\r\n            &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Details&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\nNow, this results in\r\n\r\n&gt; Caused by: org.thymeleaf.exceptions.TemplateProcessingException: Could\r\n&gt; not parse as expression:\r\n&gt; &quot;@{/users/{user_id}/details(user_id=${user.id}})}&quot; (template: &quot;users&quot;\r\n&gt; - line 13, col 44)\r\n\r\nI also tried the old post method with a hidden text field for the id and used th:object=&quot;${user.id}&quot; in the controller it&#39;s null. I left the th:object on user, while having the sole hidden field on user.id, in the controller User is null id field is not set. If I try to use th:field for anything, I again get a thymeleaf exception: \r\n\r\n&gt; Caused by: org.attoparser.ParseException: Error during execution of\r\n&gt; processor\r\n&gt; &#39;org.thymeleaf.spring5.processor.SpringInputGeneralFieldTagProcessor&#39;\r\n&gt; (template: &quot;users&quot; - line 16, col 44)\r\n\r\nMy deepest greatest respect to every web developer there is out there. I always hated anything related to web development and honestly this doesn&#39;t want me to even start to like it.

a variable that can be accessed by both the background worker and UI code. To be simple lets keep it as a public static variable.\r\n\r\n    public class YourClass\r\n    {\r\n       public static bool IsBackgroundProcessActive = true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow when you work with the message box change that variable.\r\n\r\n    if(MessageBox.Show(&quot;convert is okey&quot;)\r\n    {\r\n        yourClass.IsBackgroundProcessActive  = false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you need to make the background worker listen to this variable.\r\nFor most common cases this background worker will be a loop with a simple process.

Another example:\r\n```\r\nUserData:\r\n  Fn::Base64: !Sub |\r\n     ACCESS_KEY=${AccessKey}\r\n     SECRET_KEY=${SecretKey}\r\n```\r\nIn your case, you also need to pass a substitute variable for your `CreateDB.Endpoint.Address` attribute. Example: \r\n```\r\nUserData:\r\n  Fn::Base64:\r\n    Fn::Sub:\r\n      - |\r\n        ACCESS_KEY=${AccessKey}\r\n        SECRET_KEY=${SecretKey}\r\n        echo &quot;my db endpoint address ${MyDB}&quot;\r\n      - MyDB: !GetAtt CreateDB.Endpoint.Address\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, in your case that would become:\r\n```\r\nUserData:\r\n    Fn::Base64:\r\n      Fn::Sub:\r\n        - |\r\n          #!/bin/bash -x\r\n          sed -i &#39;s/fs-086*****/\\&quot;${EFSCreateFS}/&quot;&#39; /etc/fstab\r\n          mount -a\r\n          rm -rf /var/www/html/wordpress/*\r\n          cp /var/tmp/wpress.tar /var/www/html/wordpress/\r\n          cd /var/www/html/wordpress/ &amp;&amp; tar -xf wpress.tar\r\n          sed -i &#39;s/wordpress.cl******.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com/\\&quot;${DBEndpointAddress}\\&quot;/&#39; /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php\r\n        - DBEndpointAddress: !GetAtt CreateDB.Endpoint.Address\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following answer might also help you out: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48625737/userdata-script-with-resource-attribute-cloudformation","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409015/cloudformation-send-pararameters-to-launchconfiguration-start-script/58409370#58409370","title":"Cloudformation send pararameters to launchconfiguration start-script"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":8466323,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-PsPX4yAyb3Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFkQ/Vaa6djrX2bg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Timofii Orlov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8466323/timofii-orlov"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58409370,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571215911,"creation_date":1571214779,"question_id":58409015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58409015","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a stack script which create a cluster with EFS, MySQL, and ASG with two servers.\r\nI want to send some data to start-script such as RDS endpoint address and EFS filesystem id:\r\n\r\n    UserData:\r\n        Fn::Base64:\r\n          !Sub |\r\n            #!/bin/bash -x\r\n            sed -i &#39;s/fs-086*****/\\&quot;!Ref EFSCreateFS/&quot;&#39; /etc/fstab\r\n            mount -a\r\n            rm -rf /var/www/html/wordpress/*\r\n            cp /var/tmp/wpress.tar /var/www/html/wordpress/\r\n            cd /var/www/html/wordpress/ &amp;&amp; tar -xf wpress.tar\r\n            sed -i &#39;s/wordpress.cl******.ap-southeast-1.rds.amazonaws.com/\\&quot;!GetAtt CreateDB.Endpoint.Address\\&quot;/&#39; /var/www/html/wordpress/wp-config.php\r\n\r\nBut requests !Ref EFSCreateFS and !GetAtt CreateDB.Endpoint.Address didn&#39;t convers to their parameters.\r\nIf someone has an idea how i can send parameters, please help.\r\nThank All in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409015/cloudformation-send-pararameters-to-launchconfiguration-start-script","title":"Cloudformation send pararameters to launchconfiguration start-script"},{"tags":["html"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":692766,"user_id":19068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d2d3229ed1961d2bd81853242493247?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Quentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/19068/quentin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571215322,"post_id":58409010,"comment_id":103162125,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58409010/multi-dropdown-doesnt-show-in-html#comment103162125_58409010"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12193700,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2789073134450101/picture?type=large","display_name":"Aizen PW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12193700/aizen-pw"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8000,"user_id":2169762,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nns8w.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2169762/martin"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571214892,"creation_date":1571214748,"last_edit_date":1571214892,"question_id":58409010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58409010","body_markdown":"The values are queried but i couldn&#39;t display the sub menu because the 2nd level of the dropdown doesn&#39;t show.

A NumPy array&#39;s `__sub__` will accept any RHS and perform a broadcasted subtraction. Your object&#39;s `__rsub__` only comes into play for the individual operations in the broadcasted subtraction.\r\n\r\nThere is one very limited case where `__rsub__` is tried first, which is if the class of the RHS is a subclass of the class of the LHS. You could technically subclass `numpy.ndarray`, but that would come with a *lot* of extra baggage and still do nothing for `numpy.matrix([[1]]) - obj` or other subclasses.\r\n\r\nThere is no way to say &quot;I want my `__rsub__` to win over everything&quot;. It doesn&#39;t exist, and it wouldn&#39;t make sense for it to exist, because what would happen if you tried to subtract two objects that both want to declare their method beats everything?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s the general case. Specifically for NumPy, though, you can hook into the mechanisms that `numpy.ndarray.__sub__` delegates to.\r\n\r\nNumPy arrays delegate `__sub__` to the NumPy [ufunc][1] machinery. There are a bunch of weird customization options there, but we&#39;re interested in a specific use of one specific option: by setting [`__array_ufunc__`][2] to `None` at class level, you can declare a class incompatible with ufuncs. This means that all NumPy operator overloads will return `NotImplemented`, letting your class handle the operation. This affects *all* operators and a bunch more stuff, but in a way that you probably want:\r\n\r\n    class MyClass:\r\n        __array_ufunc__ = None\r\n        def __rsub__(self, other):\r\n            print(type(other), other)\r\n\r\nIf you want something more targeted than blocking all ufuncs, you can implement an actual `__array_ufunc__` method and just handle the case where the ufunc is subtraction and an instance of your class is the RHS:\r\n\r\n    class MyClass:\r\n        def __array_ufunc__(self, ufunc, method, *inputs, **kwargs):\r\n            if ufunc is not numpy.subtract:\r\n                return NotImplemented\r\n            if method != &#39;__call__&#39;:\r\n                return NotImplemented\r\n            if len(inputs) != 2 or inputs[1] is not self:\r\n                return NotImplemented\r\n            if kwargs:\r\n                return NotImplemented\r\n            return self.__rsub__(inputs[0])\r\n        def __rsub__(self, other):\r\n            print(type(other), other)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/ufuncs.html\r\n  [2]:

An individual schema has to support queries, but the other two types are optional. For each operation that a schema does support, it defines a single type to serve as the *root* of that operation. We refer to these three types as *root operation types*. By convention, we usually name these types `Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`, but they could have any other names as well.\r\n\r\nIf using SDL, we specify which types are associated with each operation like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nschema {\r\n  query SomeType\r\n  mutation SomeOtherType\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you&#39;re using Apollo Server, the above step is not necessary, but can be done to override the defaults Apollo provides.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using plain GraphQL.js, then the root operation types are defined as part of your schema object:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst schema = new GraphQLSchema({\r\n  query: SomeType,\r\n  mutation: SomeOtherType,\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause `Query` or `Mutation` is an object type like any other, it&#39;s important to remember that a field on the `Query` like `getUsers` is still just a field. Colloquially, we refer to these fields as queries (and fields on the mutation root type as mutations), but they are still just fields.\r\n\r\nHowever, given a GraphQLResolveInfo object, you can identify which type a field belongs to, and you can also identify the three root operation types. So you can do something like this this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst { parentType, schema } = info\r\nconst isQueryField = parentType === schema.getQueryType()\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408984/whats-the-programmatic-difference-between-a-graphql-query-and-an-object-field/58414605#58414605","title":"What&#39;s the programmatic difference between a GraphQL query and an Object field?"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6338534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19355e30b40680c0ac703022ce7bfea5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DanielOrtel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6338534/danielortel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58414605,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571232708,"creation_date":1571214671,"question_id":58408984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408984","body_markdown":"Does anyone know how I could programmatically differentiate between a graphql query and a field?

One option is to call it from a client event handler, in your case that would be either the `connect_handler()` or `dataInHandler()` functions. Another option is to start a background task before you start the web server that somehow waits for the appropriate moment to emit the data.\r\n\r\nResponse to your edit:\r\n\r\nYou are mixing asyncio and threads, and that does not work. Or actually, you cannot have a SocketIO server in use across threads, all usages must be in the same thread as the asyncio loop. If you need a background task, use a coroutine. The Socket.IO repository has an example of a background task that is started with the `socket_io.start_background_task()` function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408980/python-socket-io-emit-call-from-function/58416110#58416110","title":"python socket_io.emit() call from function"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12224888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A7BdQb5l8Fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdcgAyIN1bnzHudLt240KZAoNbyBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Moritz Vierneusel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224888/moritz-vierneusel"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571387607,"creation_date":1571387607,"answer_id":58446971,"question_id":58408980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58446971","body_markdown":"Tanks to Miguel i managed to fix my code, so no threading, instead start a background task with socketio:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\nfrom aiohttp import web\r\nimport socketio, time, asyncio\r\n\r\nconfigData = &quot;testConfig&quot;\r\ndataOut =&quot;testOut&quot;\r\ndataBack =&quot;testBack&quot;\r\ndata_flag = 0\r\nconnection_flag = 0\r\n\r\nprint(&quot;setup web-server&quot;)\r\nsocket_io = socketio.AsyncServer(async_mode=&#39;aiohttp&#39;)\r\napp = web.Application()\r\nsocket_io.attach(app)\r\n\r\napp.router.add_static(&#39;/&#39;, path=str(&#39;public/&#39;))\r\n\r\nasync def index(request):\r\n    with open(&#39;public/index.html&#39;) as f:\r\n        return web.Response(text=f.read(), content_type=&#39;text/html&#39;)\r\n\r\napp.router.add_get(&#39;/&#39;, index)   \r\n\r\n@socket_io.on(&#39;connect&#39;)\r\nasync def connect_handler(sid, environ): \r\n    global connection_flag\r\n    print(&quot;new connection&quot;) # works as expected\r\n    connection_flag = 1\r\n    await socket_io.emit(&#39;initial_config&#39;, configData) # works as expected\r\n\r\n@socket_io.on(&quot;dataIn&quot;)\r\nasync def dataInHandler(sid, data):\r\n    print(&quot;new data&quot;) # works as expected\r\n    data_flag = 1\r\n    await socket_io.emit(&#39;dataBack&#39;, dataBack) # works as expected\r\n\r\nasync def sendData(dataOut):\r\n    await socket_io.emit(&#39;dataOut&#39;, dataOut)  \r\n  \r\nasync def main():\r\n    global connection_flag\r\n    try:\r\n        print(&quot;in main loop&quot;)\r\n        await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n        print(&quot;wait till a client connects&quot;)\r\n        while connection_flag == 0:\r\n            pass\r\n        print(&quot;wait 5 seconds&quot;)    \r\n        await asyncio.sleep(5)\r\n        i = 0\r\n        while True:\r\n            print(&quot;now emitting: &quot;, i)\r\n            #await sendData(i)\r\n            await socket_io.emit(&#39;dataOut&#39;, i) \r\n            i += 1\r\n            await asyncio.sleep(1)\r\n                        \r\n    finally: \r\n        print(&quot;finished, exiting now&quot;)\r\n\r\nsocket_io.start_background_task(main)\r\nprint(&quot;starting web-server&quot;)\r\nweb.run_app(app, host=&#39;192.168.132.210&#39;, port=&#39;5000&#39;)  \r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408980/python-socket-io-emit-call-from-function/58446971#58446971","title":"python socket_io.emit() call from function"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12224888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A7BdQb5l8Fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdcgAyIN1bnzHudLt240KZAoNbyBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Moritz Vierneusel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224888/moritz-vierneusel"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12224888,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-A7BdQb5l8Fs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdcgAyIN1bnzHudLt240KZAoNbyBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Moritz Vierneusel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12224888/moritz-vierneusel"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58416110,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571387607,"creation_date":1571214650,"last_edit_date":1571314700,"question_id":58408980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58408980","body_markdown":"I am building a webserver application with aiohttp and python.

reverse proxy (Keycloak-gatekeeper) is listening on port 3000 which is also exposed by Docker.\r\nWhat I want to accomplish is that accessing http://server_host:3000 the user is redirected to Keycloak for authentication, and if this is successful, to the web server which is listening on port 8080.\r\n\r\nThis is the `keycloak-gatekeeper.conf` I&#39;m using:\r\n\r\n    # is the url for retrieve the OpenID configuration - normally the &lt;server&gt;/auth/realm/&lt;realm_name&gt;\r\n    discovery-url: http://keycloak_keycloak_1:8080/auth/realms/master\r\n    # the client id for the

interface definition you wish the proxy to listen, all interfaces is specified as &#39;:&lt;port&gt;&#39;, unix sockets as unix://&lt;REL_PATH&gt;|&lt;/ABS PATH&gt;\r\n    listen: 127.0.0.1:3000\r\n    # whether to enable refresh tokens\r\n    enable-refresh-tokens: false\r\n    # the redirection url, essentially the site url, note: /oauth/callback is added at the end\r\n    redirection-url: http://127.0.0.1:3000\r\n    # the upstream endpoint which we should proxy request\r\n    upstream-url: http://apache:8080/\r\n    secure-cookie: false\r\n    # a collection of resource i.e. urls that

configuration, accessing the URL http://server_host:3000 the browser shows an ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the problem?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I set up my middleware as follows:\r\n```\r\nconst effectMiddleware = store =&gt; next =&gt; async (action) =&gt; {\r\n    // Assert it&#39;s actually a command\r\n    if (action.command !== undefined) {\r\n        next(action)\r\n        const result = await Cmd.execute(action.command) // returns a redux action\r\n        return store.dispatch(result)\r\n    else {\r\n        next(action)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, I was running into strange errors where the next action would not be executed. I discovered that in fact middleware &quot;actions&quot; are not the same action as the ones you define in your application. Using console log I discovered that action in middlewares is actually\r\n\r\n```\r\naction: Object { type: &quot;MY_ACTION&quot;, payload: {} }\r\n​\r\nstack: undefined\r\n​\r\ntimestamp: 1571214156244\r\n​\r\ntype: &quot;PERFORM_ACTION&quot;\r\n```\r\nHence why it did not execute the action returned by Cmd.execute. I managed to get around this by creating a wrapAction function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst wrapAction = (action) =&gt;\r\n    ({ action: action, type: &quot;PERFORM_ACTION&quot;, stack: undefined, timestamp: new Date().valueOf() })\r\n\r\nconst effectMiddleware = store =&gt; next =&gt; async (action) =&gt; {\r\n    // Assert it&#39;s actually a command\r\n    if (action.action.command !== undefined) {\r\n        next(action)\r\n        const result = await Cmd.execute(action.action.command) // Cmd.execute returns a Promise&lt;redux action&gt;\r\n        return store.dispatch(wrapAction(result))\r\n    else {\r\n        next(action)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I can not find the documentation for this anywhere and so my question is: how is the middleware actually meant to be used? What&#39;s the official way to &quot;wrap&quot; actions into these middleware actions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408966/whats-the-functionality-of-redux-middleware-actions","title":"What&#39;s the functionality of redux middleware actions"},{"tags":["sql","perl","ssh","isqlquery"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":52757,"user_id":7231,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81b76985f3985e35492e25880493d045?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave Cross","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7231/dave-cross"},"last_editor":{"reputation":52757,"user_id":7231,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81b76985f3985e35492e25880493d045?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave Cross","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7231/dave-cross"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571233162,"last_edit_date":1571233162,"creation_date":1571230048,"answer_id":58413690,"question_id":58408959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58413690","body_markdown":"That looks like the kind of screen that a program would display if you tried to run it with invalid command-line arguments.

An implicit conversion known as _&quot;the usual arithmetic conversions&quot;_ convert the `int` operand to `float`. The multiplication is carried out on `float` and the resulting type is `float`. See [Implicit type promotion rules](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46073295/implicit-type-promotion-rules).\r\n\r\n- The `float` result from the previous calculation is converted to the type of the function&#39;s operand.

have a function that I&#39;m trying to test. The function is a Vuex action but thsi should not have any bearing on the question or the solution, so I&#39;ve rewritten the function be as simple as possible. The function returns a promise, which it in one case resolves inside a setTimeout:\r\n\r\n \r\n```javascript\r\nasync myFunction(context) {\r\n    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n      try {\r\n        const data = { some: &#39;data&#39; };\r\n        await axios.post(data);\r\n\r\n        setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n          context.commit(&#39;anotherFunction&#39;);\r\n\r\n          setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n            resetSomeState();\r\n            resolve();\r\n          }, 1000);\r\n        }, 1000);\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        logError(e);\r\n        reject(e);\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n```\r\n\r\nmy test looks like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nit(&#39;should call other function&#39;, async () =&gt; {\r\n        jest.useFakeTimers();\r\n        axios.post.resolve();\r\n        await myFunction(context);\r\n        jest.runAllTimers();\r\n        expect(context.commit).toBeCalledWith(&#39;anotherFunction&#39;);\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I get the error \r\n&gt;Async callback was not invoked within the 5000ms timeout specified by jest.setTimeout.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the `await` keyword on `axios.post`, it works, but to me this should have no effect on the actual test?\r\n\r\nIf I rewrite the function to not return or use promises, it works like it should. When debugging I can see that the code in the `setTimeout` is not running, which means that something I&#39;m doing to my timers has to be the culprit... However, if I remove these mock timers I still run into the same issue. \r\n\r\nWhat am I misunderstanding about testing a promise?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408928/resolving-promise-inside-settimeout-gives-timeout-error","title":"Resolving promise inside setTimeout gives timeout error"},{"tags":["python","class","oop"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571214785,"post_id":58408927,"comment_id":103161818,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408927/how-can-i-declare-a-python-class-function-that-will-be-only-used-by-another-func#comment103161818_58408927"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":11957914,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7fd38ba7716596859ad38a109d21c2b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"scooper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11957914/scooper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571215882,"post_id":58408927,"comment_id":103162428,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58408927/how-can-i-declare-a-python-class-function-that-will-be-only-used-by-another-func#comment103162428_58408927"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1307,"user_id":1440764,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukUvD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RightmireM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1440764/rightmirem"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1307,"user_id":1440764,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ukUvD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RightmireM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1440764/rightmirem"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571216522,"last_edit_date":1571216522,"creation_date":1571215887,"answer_id":58409362,"question_id":58408927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58409362","body_markdown":"@jonrsharpe is correct.

biggest problem I can see here is that `[Value]Task[&lt;T&gt;]` is an API that *enables* async, not a promise to *be* async; just because `CreateContainerIfNotExistsAsync` is named `*Async` and returns `Task&lt;T&gt;` - that *doesn&#39;t actually mean it is async* - it could run synchronously and return a result via `Task.FromResult` (aka &quot;async over sync&quot;). If you&#39;re *not concerned about that problem*, then fine I guess. But I wonder whether an `OpenAsync()` method that you call *after* construction would be more appropriate, i.e.\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic class DeviceAccess\r\n{\r\n    private Container _container;\r\n
