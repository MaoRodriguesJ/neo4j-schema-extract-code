Code:\r\n```\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        Thread t1 = new Thread() {\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                while (true) {\r\n                    System.out.print(&quot;&gt;&quot;);\r\n                    String message = sc.nextLine();\r\n                    SendMessages.send(message);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        Thread t2 = new Thread() {\r\n            public void run() {\r\n                while (true) {\r\n                    String message = RecMessages.recMessage();\r\n                    if (message != null) {\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;\\0337&quot;); // save cursor position\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;\\n&quot; + message);\r\n                        System.out.print(&quot;\\0338&quot;); // restore saved curor position\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        t1.start();\r\n        t2.start();\r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244355/java-scanner-with-ansi-escape-sequences-and-cursor-movement-displays-r-when-mov","title":"Java scanner with ANSI Escape sequences and cursor movement displays ^R when moving cursor away and back to scanner"},{"tags":["reactjs","firebase","redux"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":10813827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b736f8f0de40f55f19c595a02be8b667?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"k10a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10813827/k10a"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570256814,"creation_date":1570256814,"answer_id":58245921,"question_id":58244354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58245921","body_markdown":"    import { createStore, applyMiddleware, combineReducers } from &quot;redux&quot;;\r\n    import PostsReducer from &quot;./reducer_posts&quot;;\r\n    import reduxThunk from &quot;redux-thunk&quot;;\r\n    import { reducer as formReducer } from &quot;redux-form&quot;;\r\n\r\n    const rootReducer = combineReducers({\r\n      posts: PostsReducer,\r\n      form: formReducer\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    const store = createStore(rootReducer, applyMiddleware(reduxThunk));\r\n    export default store;\r\n\r\n\r\nI have missed `ReduxThunk`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244354/cant-fetch-firestore-data-through-redux/58245921#58245921","title":"Can&#39;t fetch firestore data through redux"}],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":10813827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b736f8f0de40f55f19c595a02be8b667?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"k10a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10813827/k10a"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":10813827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b736f8f0de40f55f19c595a02be8b667?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"k10a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10813827/k10a"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570256814,"creation_date":1570234203,"last_edit_date":1570234908,"question_id":58244354,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244354","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to fetch posts data in firestore with redux.

Second, I was (presumably) taking care of the affinity of different OpenMP threads by setting \r\n\r\n```\r\nexport OMP_PROC_BIND=true\r\nexport OMP_PLACES=cores\r\n```\r\nbut I was not setting the correct bindings for the MPI processes, as I was incorrectly launching the application as\r\n```\r\nmpirun -np 2 ./Par2S\r\n```\r\nand it seems that, with OpenMPI version 1.6.4, a more appropriate way to do it is\r\n\r\n```\r\nmpirun -np 2 -bind-to-core -bycore -cpus-per-proc 2  ./hParP2S\r\n```\r\nThe command ```-bind-to-core -bycore -cpus-per-proc 2 ``` assures 2 cores for my application (see &lt;https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v1.6/man1/mpirun.1.php&gt; and also Gilles Gouaillardet&#39;s comments on  &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47821498/ensure-hybrid-mpi-openmp-runs-each-openmp-thread-on-a-different-core&gt;). Without it, both MPI processes were going to one single core, which was the reason for the poor efficiency of the code when the flag ``` -fopenmp``` was used in the Makefile. \r\n\r\nApparently, when running pure MPI code compiled without the ``` -fopenmp``` flag different MPI processes go automatically to different cores, but with ``` -fopenmp``` one needs to specify the bindings manually as described above.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of completeness, I should mention that there is no standard for setting the correct task affinity, so my solution will not work on e.g. MVAPICH2 or (possibly) different versions of OpenMPI. Furthermore, running *nproc* MPI processes with *nthreads* each in *ncores* CPUs would require e.g. \r\n \r\n```\r\nexport OMP_PROC_BIND=true\r\nexport OMP_PLACES=cores\r\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=nthreads\r\n\r\nmpirun -np nproc -bind-to-core -bycore -cpus-per-proc ncores ./hParP2S\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhere ncores=nproc*nthreads.\r\n\r\nps: my code has an MPI_all_to_all. The condition where more than one MPI process are on one single core (no hyperthreading) calling this subroutine should be the reason why the code was about 100 times slower.

This sensor communicates via a single serial port, both for *command and control* and also for *data output*. When this sensor outputs data, it streams it out continuously.

In fact I&#39;ve written a ROS service doing primitive command/control stuff over this serial port, and it works as expected.\r\n* The *data output* portion seems like it should be output via a publisher (i.e. a stream of messages on a ROS topic).\r\n\r\nIs there any sensible way to accomplish both *command and control* and also *streaming data output* within a single ROS node? All of the serial port examples I&#39;ve found thus far are solving one problem or the other, but not both together. It seems like I would need to combine a service and publisher into the same node, but I&#39;m not even sure if that&#39;s possible.

Thus it thinks that useList is a hook and trying to enforce the [rules of hooks][1] on it. But it&#39;s not actually a hook, it&#39;s just a normal function, so you just need to give it a different name and the lint rule will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction useListProvider = () =&gt; {\r\n    const { makeRequest } = useConnections();\r\n\r\n    const callback = React.useCallback(async (props) =&gt; {\r\n        const response = await makeRequest(props);\r\n\r\n        return { body: response.body };\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return { callback };\r\n}\r\n\r\n// elsewhere:\r\n\r\nconst { callback } = useListProvider();\r\n\r\nReact.useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    if (!isBusy) { \r\n      callback(); \r\n      setIsBusy(false);\r\n    }\r\n}, [callback]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is it not a hook? Well, a hook is either one of the built in hooks, or a function that calls one of the built in hooks. Your callback doesn&#39;t meet those criteria. It was *created* by useCallback, but that just means it&#39;s a memoized function, not a hook.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244273/react-hooks-with-async-fetch/58244389#58244389","title":"React hooks with async fetch"}],"owner":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":591172,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/475c453e241134dd9e51fc6b1ada721e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sean","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/591172/sean"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58244389,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570234691,"creation_date":1570233226,"question_id":58244273,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244273","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to React hooks, but I&#39;m trying to use a `useEffect` with a `useCallback`, but getting the notorious `React Hook &quot;useList&quot; cannot be called inside a callback.

it takes me to the URL of the last planet\r\n\r\nThis is because you&#39;re using the same global variable `orbitContainer` to create 5 categories. Each time you call `createCategory`, the URL gets overwritten, so when you call `window.open(orbitContainer.userData.URL);`, it&#39;s opening the last one you assigned. What&#39;s happening is something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\norbitContainer.userData.URL = &quot;http://google.com&quot;;\r\norbitContainer.userData.URL = &quot;http://yahoo.com&quot;;\r\norbitContainer.userData.URL = &quot;http://msn.com&quot;;\r\norbitContainer.userData.URL = &quot;http://facebook.com&quot;;\r\norbitContainer.userData.URL = &quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;;\r\n\r\nwindow.open(orbitContainer.userData.URL); // &lt;- this opens stackoverflow\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n*Solution:* you should get the URL from the result of the raycaster:\r\n```\r\nintersects = raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children );\r\n\r\nif (intersects.length &gt; 0) {\r\n    window.open(intersects[0].object.userData.URL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Problem 2:\r\n&gt; when clicking on any part of the canvas\r\n\r\nthis is because you&#39;re explicitly checking for zero intersections when you do this:\r\n```\r\nif (intersects.length === 0) {\r\n    window.open(orbitContainer.userData.URL);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou should be checking for interceptions with `if (intersects.length &gt; 0)` as demonstrated in the solution above.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure you&#39;re performing a raycaster with the scene&#39;s children: `raycaster.intersectObjects( scene.children );` not with `orbitContainer`, because as I said, you overwrite it each time you create a new category, and it won&#39;t have all objects inside of it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244215/cant-open-a-pointed-url-of-selected-objects/58244335#58244335","title":"Can&#39;t open a pointed url of selected objects"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":10931844,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-yAgs_VEyrqw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcayjka5MFHNUzLVhzXUHMDQhEMd0g/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Camille Basbous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10931844/camille-basbous"},"last_editor":{"reputation":832,"user_id":7934629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f317864efe49007e9393dc29c68b7a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hitech Hitesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7934629/hitech-hitesh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570270228,"creation_date":1570232390,"last_edit_date":1570270228,"question_id":58244215,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244215","body_markdown":"I am trying to navigate to the concerned link when clicking on the concerned planets using raycaster.

For this, a list and a while loop is needed to append the inputs into the list.\r\n\r\nCurrently I am trying to implement a sentinel value that will stop the while loop after all of the user inputs have been entered, but setting the sentinel as &quot;STOP&quot; conflicts with the int() notification.\r\n\r\n```\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n    STOP = &quot;stop&quot;\r\n    mushroom = int(input(&quot;Enter a mushroom weight in grams, or STOP to end. &quot;))\r\n    total_list = []\r\n    while total_list != STOP:\r\n        total_list.append(mushroom)\r\n        mushroom = int(input(&quot;Enter a mushroom weight in grams, or STOP to end. &quot;))\r\n    print(total_list)\r\n```\r\nThe program runs well until entering &quot;STOP&quot;, where a syntax error appears.\r\n``` \r\nmushroom = int(input(&quot;Enter a mushroom weight in grams, or STOP to end. &quot;))\r\nValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: &#39;STOP&#39;\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the sentinel value STOP conflicts with my input suggestion, resulting in an error.\r\n\r\nAs for the second part of the problem, I need to sort the value inputs by weight. If everything has been done correctly, I should have a list with all the values.\r\nWhat kind of code can I use in order to sort the values? \r\nI need to sort each integer value based on small (&lt;100), medium (100-1000), and large (&gt;1000), then print the results in a statement.\r\nAm a little clueless regarding what I need to do here.\r\n\r\nThank you, just kind of stuck in one place.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244212/how-to-use-sentinel-values-different-from-input-sort-list-by-feature","title":"How to use sentinel values different from input &amp; sort list by feature?"},{"tags":["latex","r-markdown"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19658,"user_id":8416610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-cmim3CrZ9Wo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAjs/hnKTOHALc6M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ralf Stubner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8416610/ralf-stubner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570379739,"creation_date":1570379739,"answer_id":58259263,"question_id":58244210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58259263","body_markdown":"The `calligra.sty` does not set-up the Calligra as default font, but you can do so by adding\r\n\r\n    \\renewcommand{\\rmdefault}{calligra}\r\n\r\nto `header-includes`.\r\n\r\nBTW, there is no need to call `fontenc.sty`, since `calligra.sty` does so already.

If used in your program, it’s not so unlikely that they will be used again in your program or another program running in the same JVM. Other offsets have been used historically or never at all, so are not worth caching. Even if you use one once, they considered that probability that you use the same again low enough that they didn’t want to cache it until the JVM closes down (which could be in weeks or even months from now).\r\n\r\nI’m not claiming to be a mind reader, but the explanation that I have given makes sense to myself and I would suppose that if not 100 % correct, it catches the most important thoughts that have been behind the decision taken.

The idea is that instead of indexing locally, Hibernate Search delegates to a cluster of Elasticsearch nodes (which can be only one node if that&#39;s what you want). Clustering will be completely transparent to your application.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re currently on Hibernate Search 5, upgrading to 6 will require some work, since the artifact IDs, internal architecture and APIs changed. Hibernate Search 6 is also currently in Beta, so the APIs are reasonably stable but the migration guide is not ready yet, for example. I&#39;d recommend having a look at the [getting started guide for Search 6](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/6.0/reference/en-US/html_single/#getting-started) before you make the jump.\r\n\r\nIf you want to stay on Search 5, or if you want to avoid Elasticsearch for some reason, then your only remaining option is to use Search 5&#39;s &quot;clustering&quot; backends relying on JMS or JGroups. However, these architectures are complex to set up, which is the very reason we gave up on them in Search 6 (at least for now) and focused on the Elasticsearch integration. See [here for JMS](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.11/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-architecture-jms) and [here for JGroups](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/search/5.11/reference/en-US/html_single/#search-architecture-jgroups).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244191/use-hibernate-search-in-multiple-database-instances/58264782#58264782","title":"Use Hibernate-search in multiple database instances"}],"owner":{"reputation":77,"user_id":3618676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001305112707/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexcornejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3618676/alexcornejo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77,"user_id":3618676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001305112707/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexcornejo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3618676/alexcornejo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58264782,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570431636,"creation_date":1570232118,"last_edit_date":1570233301,"question_id":58244191,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244191","body_markdown":"I am working in a Hibernate-search application, currently I have been indexing a postgres database and after I created some Lucene queries and as far everything is working fine.\r\n\r\nI have some concerns about if it is possible to use Hibernate-search with multiple instances (where all instance have the same db structure).

facing a problem with socket.io and node js.\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\n\r\nI have two servers, one of them is processing heavy jobs and the other is responding to the clients.\r\nThe main case is the following one : \r\n\r\n 1. The client request data\r\n 2. The &quot;mid server&quot; looks if I have this data in the database. If I haven&#39;t, itsend a request to the second server\r\n 3. The second server performs the research.\r\n 4. Once its done, the second server push de data to the &quot;mid server&quot;\r\n 5. The mid server finally push the data to the client (and persists it for future client requests)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the sample code\r\n\r\n**Client**\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;/&gt;\r\n    var socket = io(&#39;https://localhost:9091&#39;, {&#39;forceNew&#39;: true);\r\n    // send a request to the mid server\r\n    socket.emit(&#39;request&#39;, data);\r\n\r\n    socket.on(&#39;response&#39;, async (response) =&gt; {\r\n        // when the mid server responds, the response is printed\r\n        $(&#39;#container&#39;).append(response);\r\n    });\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Mid server**\r\n```javascript\r\nconst app = require(&#39;express&#39;)();\r\nconst http = require(&#39;http&#39;).createServer(app);\r\nconst io = require(&#39;socket.io&#39;)(http);\r\n\r\n// in order to use this server as a Socket.io client\r\nconst secondServer = require(&#39;socket.io-client&#39;).connect(&#39;http://localhost:9092&#39;);\r\n\r\napp.set(&#39;view engine&#39;, &#39;ejs&#39;);\r\n\r\napp.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n    res.render(&#39;index&#39;, {})\r\n});\r\n\r\nio.on(&#39;connection&#39;, async (socket) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n    console.log(&#39;User connected&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // On client request\r\n    socket.on(&#39;request&#39;, async (data) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        console.log(&#39;Requesting from &#39; + socket.id);\r\n\r\n        // The same request is transmited to the second server\r\n        secondServer.emit(&#39;request&#39;, data);\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    // Once the second server has finished his job\r\n    secondServer.on(&#39;response&#39;, async (data) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n        console.log(&#39;Responding for &#39; + socket.id);\r\n\r\n        // I send the data back to the client\r\n        socket.emit(&#39;response&#39;, data);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    socket.on(&#39;disconnect&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        socket.disconnect();\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n\r\n// port is 9091\r\nhttp.listen(port, () =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(&#39;Server listening on port &#39; + port);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Second server**\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst io = require(&quot;socket.io&quot;).listen(9092);\r\n\r\nio.on(&quot;connection&quot;, function (socket) {\r\n     \r\n    socket.on(&#39;request&#39;, async () =&gt; {\r\n        // await in order to wait the heavyJob to be done before sending the response\r\n        var data = await heavyJob()\r\n\r\n        // Send back the data to the mid server\r\n        socket.emit(&#39;response&#39;, data);\r\n\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n**Problem**\r\n\r\nThe problem I&#39;m facing is, if I refresh the client page, the mid server will send twice the data, once to the old socket and the once for the new one as so :\r\n\r\n[![console output][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also tried to respond to the client with `socket.emit(&#39;response&#39;, data)` on mid server side and `socket.on(&#39;response&#39;, (data) =&gt; {})` on client side instead of using `callback` function. It doesn&#39;t change anything.\r\n\r\nDo I misunderstanding something ?\r\n\r\nThanks for your help\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t only happen when the client is refreshing his page. It happens when two different clients send a request at the same time. The server is responding four times, two times for each client.\r\n\r\n[![console output][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/DeQBX.jpg\r\n  [2]:

Then when I tried to downsample to 1hour increments the output was starting at a time index that was not in the original 1min data set; it would start at 9:00:00 when the earliest index in the data set is 9:31:00. After some searching I found that the solution to this issue is to include &#39;base=30&#39; inside the .resample() function.\r\n\r\n#Sample Code:\r\n    newDf = df.resample(&#39;60min&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n(SIDE NOTE: This code gives the correct output ONLY if the resample rate is input in a minute form, not hourly... &#39;60min&#39; = works, &#39;1h&#39; = doesn&#39;t work. Any explanation as to why would be appreciated but this is not my main question.)\r\n\r\nI tried it, and it worked. \r\n\r\nHowever, when I try to downsample anything over &#39;60min&#39;, the output is wrong and the dateime index start moves back to a datetime that does not exist in the original 1min data set. I tried playing with the &#39;base=60&#39; parameter and it didn&#39;t work. I then tried to use &#39;loffset=90&#39; and was able to successfully get the output to begin at the correct datetime of 9:30:00 like the other resamples I had done but the values (open, high, low, close, etc) were inconsistent when compared with the original 1min data set.\r\n\r\n\r\n#works\r\n    new5minDf = df.resample(&#39;5t&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n\r\n#works\r\n    new45minDf = df.resample(&#39;45min&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n#works\r\n    new60minDf = df.resample(&#39;60min&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n                            \r\n#DOES NOT WORK\r\n    new60minDf = df.resample(&#39;1h&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n\r\n#DOES NOT WORK\r\n    new120minDf = df.resample(&#39;2h&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n\r\n#DOES NOT WORK\r\n    new120minDf = df.resample(&#39;120t&#39;, closed=&#39;right&#39;, base=30 ).agg(dict(open=&#39;first&#39;, high=&#39;max&#39;, low=&#39;min&#39;, close=&#39;last&#39;, volume=&#39;sum&#39;, vwap=&#39;mean&#39;))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the best of my knowledge, I believe that the resample is using the first part of the day to output the the truncated resampled data. In other words, if I try to resample to 2h or 120min there will be one index location for each individual day that only contains 30min of data points. This is due to the length of a regular stock market trading session being 6.5 hours long. 6.5h or 390min is not evenly dividable by 2h or 120min so there will be one index that is actually shorter in data points than the other indexes for each individual day.\r\n\r\nIn traditional trading platforms like tradingview.com, the truncated data will show up on at the end of the day (the 2h data starts at 15:30:00 and ends at 16:00:00) and not the beginning of the day. When I&#39;m resampling the truncated data is showing up in the opposite fashion (2h truncation happens between 9:30:00 and 10:00:00) even if I use loffset to give the correct starting datetime.\r\nHow can I fix the resample index inaccuracy to not only downsample into a 2h time frame with the output starting at the correct datetime (9:30:00) but also, the truncated period showing up at the end of the day (for 2h and 3h it would be 15:30:00-16:00:00, for 4h it would be 13:30:00-16:00:00 etc). I want to be able to resample any timeframe correctly, not just the ones mentioned. If I wanted to do a 33min or 65min or 2day or 5 week resample, I would like to know how to proceed given the desired output describe above. I am stressing this because the &#39;60min, base=30&#39; solution only worked for the 1h resample and not any larger time frames. Thank you for your time and effort. I am new to all of this and I appreciated the help.\r\n\r\np.s. \r\n  I tried to paste one days worth of 1min data from my data set so that you guys can use it to achieve the desired results but it ended up being too many characters so I had to remove it. If having access the data set will help and there&#39;s another way to share it on here, just let me know.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244166/1min-stock-market-data-resample-to-over-1-hour-with-output-giving-incorrect-star","title":"1min stock market data resample to over 1 hour

has been pointed out in the Quora question that you linked to, the first two options use function pointers and the last option uses a function reference.\r\n\r\nSee [this Stack Overflow question][1] for a general discussion on whether it is better to pass a parameter by pointer or by reference.\r\n\r\nGenerally, references are easier and safer, but pointers are more powerful, as pointers can be reassigned and you can also do pointer arithmetic. This also applies to pointers and references to functions.\r\n\r\nSince you expressed that you wanted to keep it simple, I would recommend using references, i.e. the option on the third line. That way, the compiler will prevent you from doing potentially dangerous things with the reference. I see no advantages to using pointers in your case, since you have no reason to reassign the pointer or do pointer arithmetic.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is also a matter of personal preference whether you use pointers or references. Since I am more of a C programmer than a C++ programmer, I personally prefer pointers to references.\r\n\r\nWhether you use references or pointers, the compiler will generate the same machine code (which uses pointers). References are just an abstraction of pointers that only exists in your source code. They will later be converted to pointers when the compiler creates the executable file.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

All of the following allow you to do that:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;type_traits&gt;\r\n\r\n    // (1) unrestricted template parameter, like &lt;algorithm&gt; uses\r\n    template&lt;typename Func&gt;\r\n    int g(Func x) { return x(1); }\r\n\r\n    // (2) restricted template parameter to produce possibly better errors\r\n    template&lt;\r\n        typename Func,\r\n        typename=std::enable_if_t&lt;std::is_invocable_r_v&lt;int, Func, int&gt;&gt;\r\n    &gt;\r\n    int g(Func x) { return std::invoke(x, 1); }\r\n\r\n    // (3) template-less, trading a reduction in code size for runtime overhead and heap use\r\n    int g(std::function&lt;int(int)&gt; x) { return x(1); }\r\n    \r\n\r\nImportantly, all of these can be used on lambda functions with captures, unlike any of your options:\r\n\r\n    int y = 2;\r\n    int ret = g([y](int v) {\r\n        return y + v;\r\n    });","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244131/what-is-the-difference-between-different-ways-of-passing-a-function-as-an-argume/58248156#58248156","title":"What is the difference between different ways of passing a function as an argument to another function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":288,"user_id":7553068,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/14d15a8d504433d2ad0a46e8eb9de71b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"northerner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7553068/northerner"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":140,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"answer_count":2,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1570357364,"creation_date":1570231562,"question_id":58244131,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244131","body_markdown":"I have the situation where one function calls one of several possible functions. This seems like a good place to pass a function as a parameter. In this [Quoara answer][1] by Zubkov there are three ways to do this.\r\n\r\n    int g(int x(int)) { return x(1); }\r\n    int g(int (*x)(int)) { return x(1); }\r\n    int g(int (&amp;x)(int)) { return x(1); }\r\n    ...\r\n    int f(int n) { return n*2; }\r\n    g(f); // all three g&#39;s above work the same\r\n\r\nWhen should which method be used? What are there differences? I prefer the [simplest approach][2] so why shouldn&#39;t the first way always be used?\r\n\r\nFor my situation, the function is only called once and I&#39;d like to keep it simple. I have it working with pass by pointer and  I just call it with `g(myFunc)` where `myFunc` is the function that gets called last. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-pass-a-function-as-an-argument-to-another-function-in-c++-1\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244131/what-is-the-difference-between-different-ways-of-passing-a-function-as-an-argume","title":"What is the difference between different ways of passing a function as an argument to another function?"},{"tags":["javascript","phaser-framework"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1449,"user_id":1645925,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75fff2c27939898eaf3a707239a8cd47?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Buts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1645925/buts"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570231967,"post_id":58244130,"comment_id":102860385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244130/invalid-tilemap-layer-id-walls-error-on-phaser-framework-when-creating-a-stat#comment102860385_58244130"},{"owner":{"reputation":547,"user_id":4966930,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oD0C1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"brae","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4966930/brae"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570713358,"post_id":58244130,"comment_id":103006260,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244130/invalid-tilemap-layer-id-walls-error-on-phaser-framework-when-creating-a-stat#comment103006260_58244130"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7049183,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H0hnV.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user250784","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7049183/user250784"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2201,"user_id":3617531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xWKNp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alejandro Teixeira Mu&#241;oz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3617531/alejandro-teixeira-mu%c3%b1oz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570242153,"creation_date":1570231559,"last_edit_date":1570242153,"question_id":58244130,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244130","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a game, and have made a map in Tiled which i was trying to render.
