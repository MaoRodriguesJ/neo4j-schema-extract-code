is wrong. It does not work this way in C. My proposition for that is to use logical and statement (`&amp;&amp;`) by writing: \r\n```c\r\nif (1 &lt;= n &amp;&amp; n &lt;= 100000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nYou try to limit the loop to `n` in line: `for(int i=0;i&lt;=n;i++)` but you should have `&lt;` sign instead of `&lt;=`. Try to use: `for (int i=0; i&lt;n; i++)` to limit it to `n`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, When you are limitting it to `n` then you should not use `arr[i+1]` or `arr[i+2]`, because you are accessing values out of the array bounds (from memory which is just after the array). This is a reason of that exception. If you have some non-zero trash, then most probably your code will not have a floating point exception. Because you are using `arr[i+1]` and `arr[i+2]` in modulo operation and in some way they could be zero, then according to standard you can have the undefined behavior. \r\n\r\nTry to use (according to your code;

There they can be edited and any new data objects are pushed to that array.

Could anyone suggest what I might be doing wrong here?\r\n\r\n**update:** \r\n\r\nSo looking at the behaviour within the source cms, which houses the API, the patch sets the existing images to status: 0, i.e not there.

For this, I&#39;ve used a modified flip flop type D that receives the current state of my input and iterates itself by two conditions; &quot;load&quot;, which overwrites the current output to match the state of the switches, and &quot;shift&quot;, which moves the output one place to the right with every press of a button. For the output I&#39;m using a signal that connects directly to the leds.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a bunch of things but can&#39;t seem to save the last state of the of the output so that it can shift again if the &quot;shift&quot; condition is met. When I load the bitstream to my Basys 3 board, I can execute the &quot;load&quot; condition, but not the &quot;shift&quot; one. Either my output goes back to it&#39;s previous state once the &quot;shift&quot; condition resets, or the leds go crazy.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m new to vhdl, so I&#39;m at a loss on what to do here.\r\n\r\nThis is the code that&#39;s giving me trouble.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nprocess(clk)\r\n      begin \r\n      if load=&#39;1&#39; then\r\n         loaded &lt;= sw;\r\n      elsif(shift=&#39;1&#39; and rising_edge(clk)) then\r\n         loaded(7) &lt;= ini(0);\r\n         loaded (6 downto 0) &lt;= loaded(7 downto 1);\r\n         ini &lt;= loaded;\r\n         end if;\r\n    end process; \r\n\r\nled &lt;= loaded;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI understand vhdl is not a sequential language but a hardware description language.

I just want to search the first column and my search item is the phone number.\r\n\r\n    f = open(&quot;F:/.../master.txt&quot;,&quot;rt&quot;)      # open file master.txt\r\n    for line in f:                      # check each line in the file handle f\r\n     if &#39;999995555&#39; in line:           # if a particular phone number is found\r\n       print(line)                   # print the entire row\r\n    f.close()                            # close file\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the entire row to be printed on screen where the first column contains the phone number i am searching. but it is taking a lot of time as I am unable to search for the column as I don t know the code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156780/how-to-search-through-only-the-first-column-of-a-delimited-text-file-using-pytho","title":"How to search through only the first column of a delimited text file using python"},{"tags":["blazor"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":217864,"user_id":60761,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PJJAh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Henk Holterman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/60761/henk-holterman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":217864,"user_id":60761,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PJJAh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Henk Holterman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/60761/henk-holterman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569829373,"last_edit_date":1569829373,"creation_date":1569775242,"answer_id":58157215,"question_id":58156778,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58157215","body_markdown":"When you look at [the source][1] it is clear that this is used to serve up the Client App and all the assemblies it uses. \r\n\r\nYou can find the 2 relevant lines in the server Startup class:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    app.UseClientSideBlazorFiles&lt;Client.Startup&gt;();\r\n    ...\r\n      endpoints.MapFallbackToClientSideBlazor&lt;Client.Startup&gt;(&quot;index.html&quot;);\r\n\r\nin both cases the `Client.Startup` class is used to find the assembly and from there on some Reflection is used to determine which (static) files to serve. \r\n\r\nYou can remove the project reference and pass a `clientAssemblyFilePath` instead of `&lt;Client.Startup&gt;` to both methods.

are plenty of answers around SO regarding variables declared in header either as `const`, `static` or `extern`.\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t understand if `const` variable in a header which has internal

understanding, please correct if wrong):\r\n\r\n**header.h**\r\n\r\n    static int var1 = 1; // each TU has it&#39;s own copy, consumes extra memory for each inclusion\r\n    const int var2 = 2; // same as above, exe consumes memory multiple of TU inclusions\r\n    extern int var3; // variable is unique, consumes memory only in a single place.\r\n\r\nFrom my understanding `static` and `const` are the same, both have internal linkage, there are multiple copies, except that const can&#39;t be modified.\r\n\r\nBasically what&#39;s the difference between `const` and `static` regarding

The epoch is January 1, 1970. In 1972 Qatar changed from offset +04:00 to +03:00. Source: On [Time Zone in Doha, Qatar (Ad Dawhah)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/qatar/doha), in the *Time zone changes for:* dropdown select 1970–1979.\r\n\r\nWhat went wrong on your Windows computer, then? It’s a guess on my part: The way I read [Default Time Zones](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/default-time-zones) in the Windows documentation, Windows does not offer an Asia/Qatar time zone as a setting in Windows. So my guess is that your Windows is set to *Arab Standard Time* according to the table I just linked to, which in turn translates to UTC+03:00. Arab Standard Time (or Arabia Standard Time; abbreviated AST) is used in for example Kuwait, Iraq and Yemen too. But those countries have been on offset +03:00 all the time since 1970 and before. So when Java tries to pick up the default time zone from Windows, it could easily get a time zone with this history rather than the correct history for Qatar. As I said, it’s a guess for now. But you can easily verify. On your Windows computer try:\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ZoneId.systemDefault());\r\n\r\nIf it prints `Asia/Qatar`, my guess was wrong. If it prints something like `GMT+03:00`, I was right. If it prints something else, I may or may not be.\r\n\r\nEdit: A couple of further links: [AST – Arabia Standard Time (Standard Time)](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zones/ast-arabia) gives Kuwait as an example city. [Time Changes in Kuwait City Over the Years](https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/kuwait/kuwait-city) infomrs us that Kuwait too has been on offset +03:00 since 1950.\r\n\r\nFurther edit: Thanks for confirming that Java on your Windows computer prints Asia/Riyadh as its default time zone. Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has been on offset +03:00 since 1947. This at least partly explains why you get this offset even though it’s not correct for Qatar.

Here is an example using a demo dataset.\r\n​\r\n```python\r\nimport featuretools as ft\r\n​\r\ndf = ft.demo.load_mock_customer(return_single_table=True)\r\ndf = df.filter(regex=&#39;amount|customer|time&#39;)\r\n```\r\n​\r\nI create the second time column.\r\n​\r\n```python\r\ndf[&#39;transaction_time_2&#39;] = df[&#39;transaction_time&#39;]\r\ndf.head()\r\n```\r\n```\r\n     transaction_time  amount  customer_id  transaction_time_2\r\n0 2014-01-01 00:00:00  127.64            2 2014-01-01 00:00:00\r\n1 2014-01-01 00:09:45   57.39            2 2014-01-01 00:09:45\r\n2 2014-01-01 00:14:05   69.45            2 2014-01-01 00:14:05\r\n3 2014-01-01 02:33:50  123.19            2 2014-01-01 02:33:50\r\n4 2014-01-01 02:37:05   64.47            2 2014-01-01 02:37:05\r\n```\r\n​\r\nThen, I create an entity set. I use the `variable_types` parameter to set my second time column as a `DatetimeTimeIndex` variable type.\r\n​\r\n```python\r\nes = ft.EntitySet()\r\nes.entity_from_dataframe(\r\n    &#39;transactions&#39;,\r\n    df,\r\n    time_index=&#39;transaction_time&#39;,\r\n    index=&#39;id&#39;,\r\n    make_index=True,\r\n    variable_types={\r\n        &#39;transaction_time_2&#39;: ft.variable_types.DatetimeTimeIndex,\r\n    }\r\n)\r\nes.normalize_entity(&#39;transactions&#39;, &#39;customers&#39;, index=&#39;customer_id&#39;)\r\n```\r\n​\r\nLastly, I calculate the feature matrix.

And I am using react-bootstrap. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156697/how-to-get-data-from-component-in-tab-panes-after-user-fills-in-and-clicks-sav","title":"How to get data from component in tab pane(s) after user fills in and clicks save on page - react-bootstrap"},{"tags":["java","kotlin","android-room","android-architecture-components","android-mvvm"],"owner":{"reputation":329,"user_id":8964498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rSBcCMRbhpk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAeQ/rSSYeZjhMtg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alireza aslami","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8964498/alireza-aslami"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569771203,"creation_date":1569771203,"question_id":58156694,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156694","body_markdown":"I try to use a query in room dao:\r\n\r\n     @Query(&quot;Select * FROM tbl_generalItems WHERE ShowType IN (:query.Types) ORDER BY :query.OrderBy DESC LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset &quot;)\r\n        DataSource.Factory&lt;Integer, GeneralItemModel&gt; getLazyPage(int limit, int offset,SeeAllQuery query);\r\n\r\nbut I can&#39;t using SeeAllQuery .class in my query input and my `SeeAllQuery.class` is: \r\n\r\n    public class SeeAllQuery {\r\n    \r\n        private LinkedList&lt;Integer&gt; Types;\r\n        private String Query;\r\n        private String OrderBy;\r\n        private String Filter;\r\n    \r\n        public SeeAllQuery(String Query,\r\n                           String OrderBy,\r\n                           String Filter) {\r\n    \r\n            Types = new LinkedList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            this.Query = Query;\r\n            this.OrderBy = OrderBy;\r\n            this.Filter = Filter;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a solution to using this class in input of my `DAO` Query method?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156694/how-to-using-a-class-in-input-of-room-query","title":"How to using a Class in input of Room Query"},{"tags":["node.js","graphql","apollo","hapi"],"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":3290456,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttnc1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prosen Ghosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3290456/prosen-ghosh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":570,"user_id":3290456,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ttnc1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prosen Ghosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3290456/prosen-ghosh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570283218,"creation_date":1569771196,"last_edit_date":1570283218,"question_id":58156691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156691","body_markdown":"### Package name:version\r\n\r\n--------------\r\n```\r\n&quot;hapi&quot;: &quot;^17.8.5&quot;\r\n&quot;apollo-server-hapi&quot;: &quot;^2.4.8&quot;\r\n```\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### Apollo Server Setup\r\n```\r\nconst serverApollo = new ApolloServer({\r\n    typeDefs,\r\n    resolvers,\r\n    schemaDirectives,\r\n    formatError,\r\n    uploads: {\r\n        maxFieldSize: 52428800, //bytes = 50MB\r\n        maxFileSize: 52428800,\r\n        maxFiles: 10\r\n    }\r\n});\r\nawait serverApollo.applyMiddleware({\r\n    app\r\n});\r\nawait serverApollo.installSubscriptionHandlers(app.listener);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\nLess then 1MB File is uploading successfully.

Section 6.5.16.1p2 of the [C standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf) regarding the assignment operator `=` states:\r\n\r\n&gt; In simple  assignment(`=`),  **the  value  of  the  right  operand  is \r\n&gt; converted  to  the  type  of  the assignment  expression**  and \r\n&gt; replaces  the  value  stored  in  the  object  designated  by  the \r\n&gt; left operand.\r\n\r\nSo the `int` value is converted to type `char` before assignment.  And because the value 16 falls in the range of possible values for a `char`, no conversion of the value needs to take place.\r\n\r\nIf you really want to assign to multiple values of a `char` array like this, the proper way would be to assign the `int` value to an `int` variable and use `memcpy`:\r\n\r\n    int value = 16;\r\n    memcpy(&amp;arr[0], &amp;value, sizeof(value));\r\n\r\nBut even then the result would not be any different.  Assuming an `int` is 4 bytes the contents of `value` are `0x00000010`, so only one of the 4 bytes that make up this value contains a value other than 0.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156678/why-is-this-int-not-taking-up-two-bytes-of-my-array/58156802#58156802","title":"Why is this int not taking up two bytes of my array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10672072,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9429dd6fb67457f9fbb138a862db3aa8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"madmax007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10672072/madmax007"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1569787249,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569772053,"creation_date":1569771096,"question_id":58156678,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156678","body_markdown":"So basically I am really confused as to why when I assign some value of an array to an int is it not taking up two indices within that array.\r\n\r\nI have tried to change my code to use pointers/addresses instead of directly setting the array spot to the int, but none of those fix my problem/confusion.\r\n\r\nI have declared my array in my header .h file like this\r\n    char arr[4096] = {&#39;\\0&#39;};\r\n\r\nThen I assign some value of this array to 16.\r\n\r\n    arr[0]=16;\r\n\r\nThen I test to see how much space in the array 16 (an int) has taken up:\r\n\r\n            p = 0;\r\n            while(arr[p]!=&#39;\\0&#39;){\r\n            printf(&quot;testing\\n&quot;);\r\n            p++;\r\n            }\r\n            printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;,p);\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, it always prints 1 for the value of p instead of 2, indicating that only arr[0] is occupied by the int.

Don&#39;t quite understand the difference between the two.\r\n\r\n```\r\nirmadata   = pd.read_excel(&quot;DangerZone.xlsx&quot;)\r\nirma_lats  = irmadata[&quot;Average Latitude&quot;].tolist()\r\nirma_longs = irmadata[&quot;Average Longitude&quot;].tolist()\r\n\r\nshipdata   = pd.read_excel(&quot;ShipPositions.xlsx&quot;)\r\nship_lats  = shipdata[&quot;Latitude&quot;].to_numpy()  ## these are the (6, ) arrays\r\nship_longs = shipdata[&quot;Longitude&quot;].to_numpy()\r\npos = np.array([[ship_lats], [ship_longs]], dtype = &quot;d&quot;).T\r\n\r\nextent = [-10, -90, 0, 50]\r\nax = plot.axes(projection = crs.PlateCarree())\r\nax.stock_img()\r\nax.add_feature(cf.COASTLINE)\r\nax.coastlines(resolution = &quot;50m&quot;)\r\nax.set_title(&quot;Base Map&quot;)\r\nax.set_extent(extent)\r\n\r\nax.plot(irma_longs, irma_lats)\r\nfor i in range(len(ship_lats)):\r\n    lat = pos[i][0]\r\n    lon = pos[i][1]   ## This is where my error occurs\r\n    ax.plot(lon, lat, &#39;o&#39;, label = &quot;Ship &quot; + str(i+1))\r\n\r\nplot.show()\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously, I could just index `pos[0][0][1]` however, I&#39;d like to know why I&#39;m getting this issue. I&#39;m coming from MATLAB so I suppose a lot of my issues will stem from differences in how numpy and MATLAB work, and hence any tips would also be appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156658/why-is-my-array-coming-out-as-shape-6-1-2-when-it-is-made-of-two-6-arra","title":"Why is my array coming out as shape: (6, 1, 2) when it is made of two (6, ) arrays?"},{"tags":["c++","c","embedded","iar","nxp-microcontroller"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11964892,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bBjGq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Liang Jin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11964892/liang-jin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569770874,"creation_date":1569770874,"question_id":58156657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156657","body_markdown":"I am developing a project using lpc2138 in IAR for ARM 8.4.\r\nI have been going to use Timer0 interrupt for getting 1ms period, so I have written code and simulated in proteus 8.9.
