The required error handling to achieve idempotency with win_shell aint pretty:\r\n```\r\n- hosts: workstations\r\n  tasks:\r\n\r\n   ...\r\n\r\n    - name: Enable Windows feature\r\n      include_role: name=win-config tasks_from=feature\r\n\r\n    - name: Install language pack\r\n      include_role: name=win-config tasks_from=language-pack\r\n\r\n   ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n`tasks/feature.yml`:\r\n```\r\n- name: Inspect feature\r\n  win_shell: DISM /Online /Get-FeatureInfo /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V\r\n  register: check\r\n\r\n- name: Enable Windows feature\r\n  win_shell: DISM /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsft-Hyper-V /NoRestart\r\n  notify: Reboot\r\n  when: &#39;&quot;Disabled&quot; in check.stdout_lines[12]&#39;\r\n```\r\n`tasks/language-pack.yml`:\r\n```\r\n- name: Check language pack\r\n  win_shell: |\r\n    Get-WindowsPackage -Online `\r\n                       -PackagePath &#39;C:\\Programdata\\cab\\Microsoft-Windows-Client-Language-Pack_x64_sv-se.cab&#39; `\r\n                       | Select-Object `\r\n                       -ExpandProperty PackageState\r\n  register: check\r\n\r\n- name: Install language pack\r\n  win_shell: |\r\n    Add-WindowsPackage -Online `\r\n                       -PackagePath &#39;C:\\Programdata\\cab\\Microsoft-Windows-Client-Language-Pack_x64_sv-se.cab&#39; `\r\n                       -NoRestart\r\n  when: &#39;&quot;Installed&quot; not in check.stdout&#39;\r\n  notify: Reboot\r\n```\r\n`handlers/main.yml`:\r\n```\r\n- name: Reboot\r\n  win_reboot:\r\n    post_reboot_delay: 60\r\n\r\n```\r\nresult:\r\n```\r\ntasks run with status `changed` and the end of play unfolds...\r\n...\r\nRUNNING HANDLER [win-config : Reboot] ******************************************\r\nSunday 20 October 2019  18:48:55 +0200 (0:00:00.057)       0:46:55.167 ******** \r\nchanged: [node1.example.com]\r\n\r\nRUNNING HANDLER [win-config : Reboot] ******************************************\r\nSunday 20 October 2019  18:51:11 +0200 (0:02:16.527)       0:49:11.695 ******** \r\nfatal: [node1.example.com]: FAILED! =&gt; {\r\n    &quot;changed&quot;: false,\r\n    &quot;reboot&quot;: false\r\n}\r\n\r\nMSG:\r\n\r\nThe WS-Management service cannot process the request because the request contained invalid selectors for the resource.

I had a second role, with handlers, with the exact same name. My first thought was that Ansible somehow called that handler as well, but excluding the other role, or renaming handlers have not solved it for me.\r\n\r\nCan handlers be finicky about anything regarding WHAT calls them? Tasks from specific files, `task/main.yml` for example? Or should all notifications from within ONE play only trigger handlers ONCE?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476297/ansible-handler-runs-twice-at-the-end-of-a-play","title":"Ansible handler runs twice at the end of a play"},{"tags":["php","sql","oracle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36136,"user_id":1213708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e617b05eacf75c49dcf76ebb312292ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nigel Ren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1213708/nigel-ren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571599204,"post_id":58476294,"comment_id":103285653,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476294/php-oci-query-function-isnt-passing-names-correctly#comment103285653_58476294"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-usxsfr0p2po/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfnnMo2H_vTwiAdG_Dl1HPuAv8nOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andrew Roazen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247860/andrew-roazen"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":36136,"user_id":1213708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e617b05eacf75c49dcf76ebb312292ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nigel Ren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1213708/nigel-ren"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571601841,"post_id":58476294,"comment_id":103286275,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476294/php-oci-query-function-isnt-passing-names-correctly#comment103286275_58476294"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247860,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-usxsfr0p2po/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfnnMo2H_vTwiAdG_Dl1HPuAv8nOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andrew Roazen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247860/andrew-roazen"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571599090,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571598050,"creation_date":1571598050,"question_id":58476294,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476294","body_markdown":"I&#39;m newish to PHP and I&#39;ve got six Oracle queries that all require the same 2 variables to be bound to them before execution.

In iOS, the view containing the picker slides from the bottom when a corresponding field is clicked (like the Gender field. It looks like a text input but it&#39;s not. It just causes the picker to show). And in Android, it&#39;s just a modal view with items in the radio button form.

&#39;actions&#39; that occur in the `while` loop and just think about what stops the loop executing. Assuming (on the very first call to the function), that the value of `head` is **not** `NULL`, when will the loop stop? Of course, when `head` becomes `NULL` - but you never change the value of `head` in that loop! And the recursive call to `search` doesn&#39;t change it in the function that is currently running! So it&#39;s an infinite loop.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is assign `head-&gt;next` to `head` inside the loop, like this:\r\n```\r\nvoid search(struct node *head, int key, int index)\r\n{\r\n    while (head != NULL)\r\n    {\r\n        if (head-&gt;a == key)\r\n        {\r\n            printf(&quot;Key found at Position: %d\\n&quot;, index);\r\n        }\r\n        head = head-&gt;next; // If list is properly formed, this will get to NULL\r\n        search(head, key, index - 1); // Now we don&#39;t need to use the -&gt;next here\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlso, if you only want to find the **first** occurrence of the key, you could add a `return` statement after `printf`; as it stands, you will print **all** matches - but this could be want you want.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476240/why-cant-i-find-the-infinite-loop-in-my-c-program-to-search-in-a-linked-list-t/58476367#58476367","title":"Why can&#39;t I find the infinite loop in my C program to search in a linked list?

I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s possible to use expressions in the `image` field of the action metadata. I would guess that the only fields that can take expressions instead of hardcoded strings are the `args` for the image so that the `inputs` can be passed.\r\n\r\nFor reference this is the `args` section of the `action.yml` metadata.\r\nhttps://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#args\r\n\r\nI think there are other ways to achieve what you want to do. Have you tried using the `jobs.&lt;job_id&gt;.container` syntax? That allows you to specify an image that the steps of a job will run in. It will require that you publish the image to a public repository, though. So take care not to include any secrets.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you published your image to Docker Hub at `gowerc/r-latest` your workflow might look something like this:\r\n```\r\nname: Test Package\r\n\r\non: \r\n  [push, pull_request]\r\n\r\njobs:\r\n\r\n  R_latest:\r\n\r\n    name: Test on latest\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    container: gowerc/r-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@master\r\n        name: Checkout project\r\n\r\n      - name: Build and test\r\n        run: ./scripts/commands.sh\r\n```\r\nref: https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idcontainer\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can also specify your image at the step level with `uses`. You could then pass a command via `args` to execute your script.\r\n```\r\nname: my workflow\r\non: push\r\njobs:\r\n  build:\r\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\r\n    steps:\r\n      - uses: actions/checkout@master\r\n      - name: Check container\r\n        uses: docker://alpine:3.8\r\n        with:\r\n          args: /bin/sh -c &quot;cat /etc/alpine-release&quot;\r\n```\r\nref: https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#example-using-a-docker-hub-action","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476228/how-to-use-a-variable-docker-image-in-github-actions/58478925#58478925","title":"How to use a variable docker image in github-actions?"}],"owner":{"reputation":465,"user_id":4651564,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bQHonyz50Rc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAM4s/rpfGpHH1xm0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"gowerc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4651564/gowerc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571623186,"creation_date":1571597560,"question_id":58476228,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476228","body_markdown":"I am trying to write a custom github-action that runs some commands in a docker container but allows the user to select which docker container they are run in (i.e. so I can run the same build instructions across different versions of the runtime environment)\r\n\r\nMy gut instinct was to have my `.github/actions/main/action.yml` file as \r\n\r\n```\r\nname: &#39;Docker container command execution&#39;\r\ninputs:\r\n  dockerfile:\r\n    default: Dockerfile_r_latest\r\nruns:\r\n  using: &#39;docker&#39; \r\n  image: &#39;${{ inputs.dockerfile }}&#39;\r\n  args:\r\n   - /scripts/commands.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this errors with:\r\n`##[error](Line: 7, Col: 10): Unrecognized named-value: &#39;inputs&#39;.

I hope after seeing the answer you&#39;ll be able to formulate a better question.\r\n\r\nChanges I&#39;ve made:\r\n\r\nYou are using an animation for every circle but since the path is the same and the animation are identical I&#39;ve putted both circles in a group and I&#39;m animating the circle.\r\n\r\nAlso since the path is a line I could have used `animateTransform ... type=&quot;translate&quot;` instead. However you may want to change the path to something more complicated so I&#39;m sticking with `animateMotion`.\r\n\r\nIn order to animate the color you can use `&lt;animate&gt;` to animate the fill, and use the `values` attribute for the colors: `values=&quot;red;white;orange&quot;`\r\n\r\nSince you mention that the last color should apear 20seconds before the animation ends I&#39;m using `keyTimes= &quot;0; 0.8; 1&quot;`. Please note that the `keyTimes` attribute has the same number of values as the `values` attribute and represents a list of time values used to control the pacing of the animation.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin

It is a processing engine, but the question has merit for sure.\r\n\r\nIBM, see https://developer.ibm.com/blogs/performance-enhancements-in-spark-using-referential-integrity-constraints/, has done work in this area enhancing Spark, Catalyst and Optimize rules, see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SPARK-19842.\r\n\r\nTo quote:\r\n\r\n&gt; Informational Referential Integrity Constraints Support in Spark\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; This work proposes support for informational primary key and foreign\r\n&gt; key (referential integrity) constraints in Spark. The main purpose is\r\n&gt; to open up an area of query optimization techniques that rely on\r\n&gt; referential integrity constraints semantics.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; An informational or statistical constraint is a constraint such as a\r\n&gt; unique, primary key, foreign key, or check constraint, that can be\r\n&gt; used by Spark to improve query performance. Informational constraints\r\n&gt; are not enforced by the Spark SQL engine; rather, they are used by\r\n&gt; Catalyst to optimize the query processing. They provide semantics\r\n&gt; information that allows Catalyst to rewrite queries to eliminate\r\n&gt; joins, push down aggregates, remove unnecessary Distinct operations,\r\n&gt; and perform a number of other optimizations. Informational constraints\r\n&gt; are primarily targeted to applications that load and analyze data that\r\n&gt; originated from a data warehouse. For such applications, the\r\n&gt; conditions for a given constraint are known to be true, so the\r\n&gt; constraint does not need to be enforced during data load operations.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The attached document covers constraint definition, metastore storage,\r\n&gt; constraint validation, and maintenance. The document shows many\r\n&gt; examples of query performance improvements that utilize referential\r\n&gt; integrity constraints and can be implemented in Spark.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSo, as Catalyst improves more of this support will be added, but not just yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Controller gets list with single item. I thought, that view always pass list with only one item that is in form. That&#39;s why i wrote somethink like this: `service.Duration = model.Services[0].Duration;` \r\n\r\nBut for other items, controller gets null list. It looks like it want pass item with index for example 3, but previous indexes do not exists, so it is null in overall.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t want to pass list with all items, because it is quite large, i only want to pass one element.\r\nAlso i would like to use this list and `@Html.TextBoxFor` because it nicely populate textBox with current values. \r\n\r\nSo, is there any solution to pass list with one item?

FYI: I can use the &#39;clientauthentication&#39; methods fine in the 1st file and it works okay.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476182/best-way-to-reuse-c-code-to-pass-system-servicemodel-security-usernamepasswordc","title":"Best way to reuse C# code to pass system.servicemodel.security.usernamepasswordclientcredential credentials to different class files"},{"tags":["paypal"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12247924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb91b80921c269a12ea31d4c900d9ead?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kamix04","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12247924/kamix04"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571597147,"creation_date":1571597147,"question_id":58476181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476181","body_markdown":"I&#39;m making a website where users earn money by watching ads and playing games.

This is quite easy with the entityType class and multiple option.\r\nBut the usability would be much better to implement it with jQuery like [symfony-collection][1]\r\nAfter hours of trying without success I am not sure if this is possible with this plugin.\r\nI was able to get the dropdowns, to add or remove them, but # of existing machines at one customer show the same number of dropdowns with placeholder instead of correct id and persisting to the database always gives an error.\r\n\r\nSo my question is: Is that the right way, or am I completely wrong with my understanding of this plugin?\r\nAlso in the doctrine example at the homepage there is first a list of existing items and then the plugin.

There are tradeoffs for every solution in this case.\r\n\r\nBased on the extra information you have given in the comments, the best solution I can think of in this case is [marshalling][1] your individual &quot;recording sessions&quot; onto a file. However, there is a little overhead to be done in order to achieve this.\r\n\r\n 1. Create a class called `Frame`, create another class called `Record` which has a `List&lt;Frame&gt; frames`. That way, you can place any information that you would like to be captured in each frame as attributes in the `Frame` class.\r\n 2. Since you can&#39;t marshal a generic type, you will have to marshall each frame individually. I suggest implementing a method in the `Record` class called `MarshalRecording()` that handles that for you.\r\n 3. However, in doing that, you will find it difficult to unmarshal your records because they may have different sizes in binary form and they wouldn&#39;t have a separator indicating where a frame ends and where the next frame begins. I suggest appending the size information at the beginning of each marshalled frame, that way you will be able to unmarshal all of the frames even if they have different sizes.\r\n\r\nAs @PiotrK pointed out in his answer, you could use [protobuf][2]. However, I don&#39;t recommend it for your specific use. Personally, I think this is overkill (Too much work for too little results, protobufs can be a PITA some times).\r\n\r\nIf you are worried about storage size, you could [LZ4][3] the whole thing (if you are concatenating the binary information in memory), or LZ4 each frame (if you are processing each frame individually and then appending it to a file). I recommend the latter one because, depending on the amount of frames, you may run out of memory while you marshal your record.\r\n\r\n**Ps: Never use XML, it&#39;s cancerous!**\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshalling_(computer_science)\r\n  [2]: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ4_(compression_algorithm)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476165/unity3d-what-file-format-should-i-store-my-replays/58488256#58488256","title":"Unity3D - What file format should I store my replays"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":4214922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100003077452923/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mike Ottink","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4214922/mike-ottink"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58488256,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571667812,"creation_date":1571597043,"question_id":58476165,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476165","body_markdown":"I a making a state saving replay system in Unity3D and I want the replay to be written to a file.

If you want this to behave as if `preserveRatio` was set to `true` then use the following `BackgroundSize`:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nnew BackgroundSize(1.0, 1.0, true, true, true, false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe difference is the fifth argument, `contain`, which has been changed from `false` to `true`. Check out [the documentation][1] to understand more about what each argument does.\r\n\r\nNote that using a `BackgroundImage` in this way means the `Region` won&#39;t compute its preferred dimensions based on the image. This may or may not cause problems for you. For instance, during a layout&#39;s initial sizing it won&#39;t take the image into account. However, afterwards everything should work the same as `ResizableImageView`—as the `Region` is resized so is the image.\r\n\r\nA `BackgroundImage` can also be set via CSS:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n.your-region-class {\r\n    -fx-background-image: url(...);\r\n    -fx-background-repeat: no-repeat;\r\n    -fx-background-position: center;\r\n    -fx-background-size: contain; /* or 100% 100% to act as if preserveRatio is false */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://openjfx.io/javadoc/13/javafx.graphics/javafx/scene/layout/BackgroundSize.html\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476162/is-it-possible-to-make-a-imageview-in-javafx-responsive/58516268#58516268","title":"Is it possible to make a ImageView in JavaFX responsive?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11544951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FWNekjWSY0o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcb80jM_64rPeJwkx-1bwBQlKI8xQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sarah Multitasker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11544951/sarah-multitasker"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571810662,"creation_date":1571597025,"question_id":58476162,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476162","body_markdown":"me and some friends are having a project, where we try to programm a game in JavaFX. We&#180;ve got a GridPane, thats growing with ImageViews inside to hold the map and the game character, etc. (The game character and enemies will have their own imageview, that we can move around in the gridpane.) So, our problem now is, that we want out pictures to get bigger, when the window is getting bigger also, but right now only the columns of the GridPane are getting more distance to each other. I tried to find a way to change that, but I am not sure, if it is possible, cause ImageViews only have &quot;FitHeight&quot; and &quot;FitWidth&quot; and no prefWidth/Height or maxWidth/Height, as far as I see. I also tried to put HGrow and VGrow on always or sometimes, but it didn&#180;t work. We can&#180;t resize them with checking the stages size and changing their size in proportion to it all the time, cause we&#180;ve got more than 800 ImageViews in our map to display all the Images.

have a finite amount of storage.  They overwrite that storage.  It&#39;s *not* like a SSA model where every assignment creates a new variable.  Computers really do change the value of an existing storage location.\r\n\r\nThe C language is defined in terms of every variable having its own memory location.  Assigning a new value does *not* change the address.  It&#39;s not a reference to a new immutable value, it&#39;s really mutating the storage for `int i`.  **Writing a new value implicitly destroys the previous contents of a variable**.  It doesn&#39;t *go* anywhere.\r\n\r\nYou can look at an example of using pointers to see that after `int *p = &amp;i;` the value you get from `*p` changes after you do `i=7;`  Or google up a tutorial on C pointers for more detail.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**It&#39;s not &quot;magic&quot;, just electrically how a memory cell naturally works**.  e.g. a single [flip-flop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flip-flop_(electronics)) can be changed from one state to another by applying an input signal along with a reset signal that tells it to forget its old value.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**A physical analogy is a piece of paper with a pencil and eraser,** *not* a big stack of fresh index cards.  The &quot;consumable&quot; (pencil lead and eraser) is just electrical power.  (Or more specifically, electric charge in CMOS logic.  Some other kinds of digital logic require current to *flow* continuously, using a lot of power.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCPU registers are typically made of SRAM (static RAM), see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_random-access_memory#Writing.  One cell is usually made of 6 transistors, for example, like a flip-flop but fancier and with no current flowing except when a new value is set.  This stores 1 bit, and can be written with a new value any number of times, by applying a write-enable signal to update the SRAM cell to the value in its input line.\r\n\r\nActual main-memory is typically made of [DRAM][1], where bits are stored as charge on a capacitor.  Every time you read it, you have to refresh this charge, but it&#39;s still the same concept of a fixed location that can be written with new values.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_random-access_memory","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476157/how-does-modify-value-on-the-same-memorys-address-will-delete-the-previous-valu/58476512#58476512","title":"How does modify value on the same memory&#39;s address will delete the previous value? &quot;OVERWRITTEN concept on PC&#39;s mode operation&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11153951,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e456ff80130b13fadfa62f7a0ac3faa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tony.M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11153951/tony-m"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58476512,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571599451,"creation_date":1571596986,"last_edit_date":1571599440,"question_id":58476157,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58476157","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new on world of computing and computers ..I&#39;m developing in C programming and really every time I get stuck in my thinking how really PC delete the old value if we modified it by new value, I mean:\r\nlets assume I write on C like this\r\n```\r\nint i=6;\r\ni=7;\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the value of i is 7, I know why because we have modified the old value by 7, but how does really the PC delete the previous value?

First, calling your `eleves` relationship on your blade form like this:\r\n\r\n    $retour-&gt;eleves()\r\n\r\nis going to go back to the database on every single call.  This could add up to a lot of delay if you have a lot of `retour` objects, or even if you just go through that table.\r\n\r\nStrongly recommend eager loading as much as you can on at least the `retour` collection.  \r\n\r\n**On your controller**:\r\n\r\n    // Not sure if you had any constraints, but this will eager load eleves\r\n    $retours = Retour::with(&#39;eleves&#39;)-&gt;get();  \r\n\r\nThe issue with your always pulling the same date is that you are *possibly* pulling from the same object.  I love a good chain... but sometimes longer chains become more confusing than they are worth.  Take a look at this line:\r\n\r\n    $retour-&gt;eleves()-&gt;first()-&gt;cours()-&gt;first()-&gt;date_seance\r\n\r\nIf you break this down from just the first loop on your blade page, you are pulling the first `eleves` from this first `retour` object from the overall collection of `retour` objects.  Then, you are pulling the first `cours` object from that first `eleves` from that first `retour` object.  The reason the date is the same is that you are *possibly* pulling the same `cours` object.  I say possibly because the `first()` method is just pulling the first instance associated with the `retour` object in the database.  Not the *latest*, just the first.  So, if there are multiple `eleves` for every `retour`, if the one with say `id` of 1 is attached to both the first and the second `retour`, you are pulling the same exact `eleves` in the second loop.  This is further compounded by exactly the same issue on the `cours` relationship with `eleves`.  If you have say a `cours` with `id` of 21 attached to multiple `eleves`, you *might* be pulling the exact same `cours` even though you are on a totally different loop for both `retour` and `eleves`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this, you need to have a solid handle on *which* `eleves` and *which* `cours` objects you are referring to in your loop.  I would recommend not querying at the top level (`retours`), but rather, having a couple of lower level queries on those relationships (`eleves` or `cours`) and loop directly on those in your blade.\r\n\r\nE.g. **in your Controller**:\r\n\r\n    $courses = Cours::where(&#39;some constraint&#39;, $someConstrainer)-&gt;get()\r\n\r\nThen, **in your blade**, just loop on the `$courses` collection:\r\n\r\n    @foreach($courses as $cours){\r\n        // Other stuff here...\r\n        &lt;td&gt; {{ $cours()-&gt;first()-&gt;date_seance-&gt;format(&#39;d/m/Y&#39;) }}&lt;/td&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you can&#39;t do it at the `cours` level, perhaps back out one level higher and load with `eleves` (while eager loading the `cours` objects).  \r\n        ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58476148/eloquent-id-foreign-key/58477357#58477357","title":"Eloquent ID &amp;
