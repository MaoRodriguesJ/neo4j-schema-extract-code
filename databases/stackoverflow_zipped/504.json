are correct that `B.v = 3` simply overwrites the descriptor with an integer (as it should).\r\n\r\nFor `B.v = 3` to invoke a descriptor, the descriptor should have been defined on the metaclass, i.e. on `type(B)`.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; class BMeta(type): \r\n    ...     v = VocalDescriptor() \r\n    ... \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; class B(metaclass=BMeta): \r\n    ...     pass \r\n    ... \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; B.v = 3 \r\n    __set__\r\n\r\nTo invoke the descriptor on `B`, you would use an instance: `B().v = 3` will do it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for `B.v` invoking the getter is to allow returning the descriptor instance itself.  Usually you would do that, to allow access on the descriptor via the class object:\r\n\r\n    class VocalDescriptor(object):\r\n        def __get__(self, obj, objtype):\r\n            if obj is None:\r\n                return self\r\n            print(&#39;__get__, obj={}, objtype={}&#39;.format(obj, objtype))\r\n        def __set__(self, obj, val):\r\n            print(&#39;__set__&#39;)\r\n\r\nNow `B.v` would return some instance like `&lt;mymodule.VocalDescriptor object at 0xdeadbeef&gt;` which you can interact with. It is literally the descriptor object, defined as a class attribute, and its state `B.v.__dict__` is shared between all instances of `B`.\r\n\r\nOf course it is up to user&#39;s code to define exactly what they want `B.v` to do, returning `self` is just the common pattern.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420173/why-does-setting-a-descriptor-on-a-class-overwrite-the-descriptor/58420458#58420458","title":"Why does setting a descriptor on a class overwrite the descriptor?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571254710,"creation_date":1571254710,"answer_id":58420594,"question_id":58420173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420594","body_markdown":"Barring any overrides, `B.v` is equivalent to `type.__getattribute__(B, &quot;v&quot;)`, while `b = B(); b.v` is equivalent to `object.__getattribute__(b, &quot;v&quot;)`.

Warning:  i went into the weeds.  I&#39;m really hoping I can get help from [a captain who knows those waters][2].  I tried to be as explicit as possible in tracing the calls I was looking at, for my own future benefit and the benefit of future readers.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen a lot of ink spilled over the behavior of `__getattribute__` applied to descriptors, e.g. lookup precedence.  The Python snippet in [&quot;Invoking Descriptors&quot;][3] just below `For classes, the machinery is in type.__getattribute__()...` roughly agrees in my mind with what I believe is the corresponding [CPython source][4] in `type_getattro`, which I tracked down by looking at [&quot;tp_slots&quot;][5] then [where tp_getattro is populated][6].  And the fact that `B.v` initially prints `__get__, obj=None, objtype=&lt;class &#39;__main__.B&#39;&gt;` makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is, why does the assignment `B.v = 3` blindly overwrite the descriptor, rather than triggering `v.__set__`?  I tried to trace the CPython call, starting once more from [&quot;tp_slots&quot;][5], then looking at [where tp_setattro is populated][7], then looking at [type_setattro][8].  `type_setattro` [appears to be][9] a thin wrapper around [_PyObject_GenericSetAttrWithDict][10].  And there&#39;s the crux of my confusion:  `_PyObject_GenericSetAttrWithDict` appears to have [logic that gives precedence to a descriptor&#39;s `__set__` method][11]!!  With this in mind, I can&#39;t figure out why `B.v = 3` blindly overwrites `v` rather than triggering `v.__set__`.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer 1:  I did not rebuild Python from source with printfs, so I&#39;m not \r\ncompletely sure `type_setattro` is what&#39;s being called during `B.v = 3`.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer 2:  `VocalDescriptor` is not intended to exemplify &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot; descriptor definition.  It&#39;s a verbose no-op to tell me when the methods are being called.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57273021/setting-class-attributes-does-not-use-descriptor-setter\r\n  [2]:

Means  you consume one message at a time get process and published to another topic and commit. So commit will be handle by Stream automatically one message a time. \r\nkafka Stream achieve these be setting below parameters which can not be overwrite \r\n\r\n&gt;  - isolation.level: (read_committed) - Consumers will always read    committed data only   \r\n&gt;  - enable.idempotence: (true) - Producer will always have idempotency    enabled\r\n&gt;  - max.in.flight.requests.per.connection&quot; (5) - Producer will always       have one in-flight request per connection\r\n\r\nIn case any error in consumer or producer kafka stream always retry specific configured number of attempt. \r\nKafkaStream doesn&#39;t guarantee inside processing logic we still need to handle e.g. there is requirement for DB operation and if DB connection got failed in that case Kafka doesn&#39;t aware  so you need to handle by your own.\r\n\r\nAs per pattern definition yes we need consumer , process and producer topic but in general it&#39;s not stopping you if you don&#39;t output to another topic.

use gattool to connect with BLE device on Linux virtual machine(Ubuntu). There are three roles in the system: peripheral, central, and laptop(only receiving logging info for debugging)\r\n\r\nAfter connecting, I need to send out a message to the peripheral so that it will send out logging information to Linux when the central interacts with the peripheral. So my code is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconnect\r\n# cmd for the peripheral sending out logging\r\nchar-write-cmd 0x000f 70\r\n# enable notification\r\nchar-write-req 0x000c 0100 --listen\r\n```\r\nIt can print out the notification normally, if the peripheral can keep sending out logging to laptop. But if the peripheral stops sending out the logging for (4-5) seconds, and resumes after that, the laptop will no longer print out the message. But it is not disconnected, because I can still write to the peripheral and receive normal feedback after that. And also no error like `(gatttool:5840): GLib-WARNING **: Invalid file descriptor.`\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the possible reason for it and how can to fix it?

From u/inio on Reddit:\r\n\r\n&gt; So usually for phone form-factor devices there will be a 90&#176; rotation between the camera coordinate system (which is defined to have +x point in the diction of the horizontal axis of the physical camera image, typically the long axis of the device) and the android sensor coordinate system (which has +y pointing away from the android navigation buttons, and +x thus along the short axis of the device). The difference you describe is an 88.8&#176; rotation. Maybe you want the virtual camera pose? [Source][1]\r\n\r\nI tested with using the getDisplayOrientedPose(). With it, I get what I expect when I am in portrait mode. But, if I flip to landscape, then the coordinate system changes, and I am off by a 90&#176; rotation. So I instead did the rotation myself. \r\n```\r\npublic void processFrame(Frame frame) {\r\n    if (frame.getCamera().getTrackingState() != TrackingState.TRACKING) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Get the magnetic vector in sensor that we stored in the onSensorChanged() delegate\r\n    float[] magneticVectorInSensor = {x,y,z};\r\n\r\n    // Get sensor to world\r\n    Pose sensorToWorldPose = frame.getAndroidSensorPose();\r\n\r\n    // Get camera to world\r\n    Pose cameraToWorldPose = frame.getCamera().getPose();\r\n\r\n    // +90&#176; rotation about Z\r\n    // https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/issues/535#issuecomment-418845833\r\n    Pose CAMERA_POSE_FIX = Pose.makeRotation(0, 0, ((float) Math.sqrt(0.5f)), ((float) Math.sqrt(0.5f))); \r\n    Pose rotatedCameraToWorldPose = cameraToWorldPose.compose(CAMERA_POSE_FIX);\r\n\r\n    // Get world to camera\r\n    Pose worldToCameraPose = rotatedCameraToWorldPose.inverse();\r\n\r\n    // Get sensor to camera\r\n    Pose sensorToCameraPose = worldToCameraPose.compose(sensorToWorldPose);\r\n\r\n    // Get the magnetic vector in camera coordinate space\r\n    float[] magneticVectorInCamera = sensorToCameraPose.rotateVector(magneticVectorInSensor);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcore/comments/diu3te/how_to_convert_the_magnetic_field_vector_from/f47pwto?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420057/how-to-convert-the-magnetic-field-vector-from-sensor-coordinate-space-to-camera/58494661#58494661","title":"How to convert the magnetic field vector from sensor coordinate space to camera coordinate space?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10592859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbf4d9a441d79c226cac7a2e1644d21c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jerboa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10592859/jerboa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10592859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbf4d9a441d79c226cac7a2e1644d21c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jerboa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10592859/jerboa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58494661,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571695170,"creation_date":1571252468,"last_edit_date":1571260422,"question_id":58420057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420057","body_markdown":"I would like to collect the magnetic field vector (i.e. x,y,z in microteslas) from the [TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD Position sensor][1] and put it in the same coordinate system that the [Frame&#39;s][2] we get from ARCore are in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field vector is in the [Sensor Coordinate System][3].

Since an `a` tag doesn&#39;t have to contain `href` parameters I guarded against retrieving any such tags by accident.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve got bugs, potential bugs and bad practices. Here are some untested but likely to work ways to fix them:\r\n\r\nRunning the code results in:\r\n\r\n    uninitialized constant KefotoScraper (NameError)\r\n\r\nIn your code you have `@service` and `@service_links` which are never initialized so...?\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t do this because it&#39;s cruel:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef home_html\r\n  Nokogiri::HTML(open(PAGE_URL))\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery time you call `home_html` you (re)open and (re)read the page from the remote site and wasting your and their CPU and network time. Instead, cache the parsed document in a variable kind of like you did in your commented-out line using HTTParty. It&#39;s much more friendly to not hit sites repeatedly and helps avoid getting banned.\r\n\r\nMoving on:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef service_names\r\n  @service_names = home_html.css(&quot;.nav-link&quot;).map do\r\n    |link| link[&#39;href&#39;].to_s.gsub(/.php/, &quot;&quot;)\r\n  end\r\n  @service_names.each do |pr|\r\n    @@product_names &lt;&lt; pr\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;d use something like `get_product_names` and return the array like I did in Nokogiri above:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_product_names\r\n  get_html.css(&#39;.nav-link[href]&#39;).map { |l|\r\n    l[&#39;href&#39;].sub(/\\.php$/, &#39;&#39;)\r\n  }\r\nend\r\n:\r\n:\r\n@@product_names = get_product_names()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s why I&#39;d do it another way. You used:\r\n```\r\nlink[&#39;href&#39;].to_s.gsub(/.php/, &quot;&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n 1. `to_s` is redundant because `link[&#39;href&#39;]` is already returning a string. Stringizing a string wastes brain cycles when rereading/debugging the code. Be kind to yourself and don&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\n        require &#39;nokogiri&#39;\r\n        html = &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&#39;\r\n        doc = Nokogiri::HTML(html)\r\n        doc.at(&#39;a&#39;)[&#39;href&#39;] # =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;\r\n        doc.at(&#39;a&#39;)[&#39;href&#39;].class # =&gt; String\r\n\r\n 2. `gsub` Ew. How many occurrences of the target string do you anticipate to find and replace? If only one, which is extremely likely in a URL &quot;href&quot;, instead use `sub` because it&#39;s more efficient; It only runs once and moves on whereas `gsub` looks through the string at least one additional time to see if it needs to run again.\r\n 3. `/.php/` doesn&#39;t mean what you think it does, and it&#39;s a very subtle bug in waiting. `/.php/` means &quot;some character followed by &quot;php&quot;, but you most likely meant &quot;a period followed by &#39;php&#39;&quot;. This was something I used to see all the time because other programmers I worked with didn&#39;t bother to figure out what they were doing, and being the senior guy it was my job to pick their code apart and find bugs. Instead you should use `/\\.php/` which removes the special meaning of `.`, resulting in your desired pattern which is not going to trigger if it encounters `&quot;aphp&quot;` or something similar. See &quot;[Metacharacters and Escapes][1]&quot; and the following section on that page for more information.\r\n\r\n 4. On top of the above, the pattern needs to be anchored to avoid wasting more CPU. `/\\.php/` will cause the regular expression engine to start at the beginning of the string and walk through it until it reaches the end. As strings get longer that process gets slower, and in production code that is processing GB of data it can slow down a system markedly. Instead, using an anchor like `/\\.php$/` or `/\\.php\\z/` gives the engine a hint where it should start looking and can result in big speedups. I&#39;ve got some answers on SO that go into this, and the included benchmarks show how they help. See &quot;[Anchors][2]&quot; for more information.\r\n\r\nThat should help you but I didn&#39;t try modifying your code to see if it did.

It&#39;s maintained by the Chromium Project, while Chrome is maintained by Google. Aside from code-opennes, the main difference (for your concerning question) between the two browsers is that Google adds a number of proprietary features to Chrome like automatic updates and support for additional video formats. Also added is AAC, H.264, and MP3 support. Giving you acess to a wider variety of media content, like sites using HTML5 to stream H.264 videos. Both browsers include Opus, Theora, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, and WAV codecs. Chrome also includes a sandboxed Adobe Pepper API (PPAPI) Flash plug-in that updates along with.\r\nFrom a programmatic side, both support Google DevTools protocol with all of the flexibility and possibilities this brings, like browser automation using the popular *puppeteer*  Node.js runtime, allowing you to run automated tests either in head or headless environments. Both browsers use the Blink rendering engine and the V8 JavaScript engine, so both will give you same support for CSS, HTML and DOM parsing/rendering, and same JavaScript compatibility, functionality and performance. So the real difference is if you&#39;re developing media-content centric web apps, in that case you will benefit more from Chrome since it includes all of the above mentioned extra plugins and supported formats, all of this makes the web more accessible to it and provides a wider range of things you could do.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420050/are-google-chrome-and-chromium-equivalent-for-web-design-development/58420356#58420356","title":"Are Google Chrome and Chromium equivalent for web design/development?"}],"owner":{"reputation":131,"user_id":10580177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d326564acee958563c90144aa3bee5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sekhemty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10580177/sekhemty"},"last_editor":{"reputation":131,"user_id":10580177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d326564acee958563c90144aa3bee5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sekhemty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10580177/sekhemty"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571411607,"creation_date":1571252432,"last_edit_date":1571260830,"question_id":58420050,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420050","body_markdown":"This is probably a silly question, however: from a Web Design/Development point of view (I mean support for web standards and web technologies), could Google Chrome and Chromium be considered equivalent?\r\n\r\nI know that they are essentially the same browser, the former being the branded version of the latter, but they also have some functional differences, and Google Chrome features some additions not present in the base Chromium browser (detailed on the [Chromium page][1] on Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nThey use the Blink engine, which is in turn also used by other Chromium-based browsers like MS Edge and Opera; and all these browsers have an uneven support for many different web technologies, as detailed on https://caniuse.com.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m working on a Linux machine, and my distro ships Chromium by default, providing it from its standard repo; for the sake of simplicity and keeping things clean, I would prefer to avoid adding another external repo and install Chrome just for this task, if I can rely Chromium to behave exactly the same and not have any compatibility issue.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this question is probably silly, but given the differences between other Chromium-based browsers, maybe this doubt of mine could be justified. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Please note that I&#39;m not interested in the differences between Google Chrome and Chromium from an user point of view or in details of their history and so on; I only wish to know if from a website development point of view, they are fully compatible or if they support the same set of features. **In other words, if I test a site from Chromium, can I be sure that it will work also in Google Chrome?

entering a dropdown value in a column, if this is the first use of that dropdown value, then you want to create a sheet with the name of the dropdown value. If it isn&#39;t the first use, then there is no action (other than to populate the dropdown).\r\n\r\nThis requires a combination of factors:detecting the dropdown, ensuring it is in the right sheet, column and row, determining whether the value has been used before and, if not, to create the new sheet. There are probably many ways that this might be done; consider the following just one example.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the relevant sheet to watch is &quot;Sheet1&quot;, and the relevant column is &quot;Column A&quot;. There is one header row, and there are dropdown cells in the rows below the header row.\r\n\r\nThe logic flow is:\r\n\r\n - use a simple [onEdit(e) trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/#onedite) to detect data entry.\r\n - use [Event objects](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/events) to determine the edited column, row, sheet name and value.\r\n - use other variables to manage the number of header rows, and the relevant column to watch.\r\n - create an `IF` statement to confirm that the edit was in the relevant sheet, column and row, then\r\n  - get the range and values in Column A - include row 1 so that `setValues()` will always apply\r\n  - flatten the resulting 2D array to 1D using the Javascript [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method\r\n  - find the first and last occurence of the dropdown value in the range using Javascript [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) and [lastIndexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf)\r\n  - if the first and last values are the same, then this must be the first and only use of the dropdown value, so create a new sheet [insertSheet(sheetName)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#insertsheetsheetname) where &quot;sheetname&quot; is the dropdown value.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e){\r\n      \r\n      //so5842003001\r\n      \r\n      var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()\r\n      var sheetname = &quot;Sheet1&quot;;\r\n      var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(sheetname);\r\n      \r\n      //Logger.log(JSON.stringify(e));//DEBUG\r\n      \r\n      var eColumn = e.range.getColumn();\r\n      var eRow = e.range.getRow();\r\n      var eSheet = e.source.getSheetName();\r\n      var eValue = e.value;\r\n      var headerrow = 1;

Obviously I cannot therefore use this strategy to get a reference to a `ChunkedWriteHandler` in order to call its `resumeTransfer()` method.\r\n\r\nMy question is: what strategy _should_ I use?

am working on a project for which I have created a small sample. \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nI wish to allow **three actions** to the user where he/she is allowed to select 3 different cell ranges one after the other. After selecting first range, a macro will run and capture 4 things, FromValue, ToValue, TimeDiff &amp; CABIN and dump those four values in Sheet2 in a tabular format. Then the next range will be selected by the user (second action) and values will be dumped below the previous one and then the third action. I am attaching a picture to demonstrate what I need to capture and dump. \r\n\r\nDisired output = Sheet2 should look like below after the **three actions**\r\n\r\n    01-Oct-2019 00:15 | 01-Oct-2019 01:00 | 00:45 | CABIN 1\t\t\t\r\n    01-Oct-2019 23:15 | 02-Oct-2019 01:00 | 01:45 | CABIN 2\t\t\t\r\n    02-Oct-2019 23:15 | 02-Oct-2019 23:30 | 00:15 | CABIN 2\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n\r\n - Cell B2 contains month and year in mmm-yyyy format.\r\n - The remaining cells in row 2 will have dates from 1 to 28/29/30/31 depending on  \r\n - which month it is.\r\n - Row 3 will have time values\r\n - Next rows will have Cabin names\r\n\r\nConditions\r\n\r\n1.

I thought maybe the sleep method would solve this issue but it isn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n- I can&#39;t add my server here. The code it way too complex. But i can say that i don&#39;t have functionality to closes incoming connections. So normally everything should stay up.\r\n\r\n- If you think there is a better way to do this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420003/why-are-my-sockets-closing-after-a-certain-of-time","title":"Why are my sockets closing after a certain of time?"},{"tags":["reactjs","docker","express","kubernetes","google-bigquery"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255613,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183703,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183703_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255918,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183836,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183836_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255948,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183856,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183856_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571257497,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103184558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103184558_58420068"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571252516,"creation_date":1571252516,"answer_id":58420068,"question_id":58420000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420068","body_markdown":"You can copy all required file from the host to docker image and it will able to access other required as same as you are accessing now.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nEXPOSE 8080\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\nCOPY . .\r\nCMD node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `copy . .` will copy entire files and directories structure form the current context to `/app` of the docker image.\r\n\r\nSo I will suggest keeping only desired files in this context ( mean the directory where you place the dockerfile) to keep the image small.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#58420068","title":"How to Containerize multiple files with Docker"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58420068,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571252516,"creation_date":1571252222,"question_id":58420000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420000","body_markdown":"I created a simple application with reactjs/express.

I&#39;d expect you will need to store some authorization data to send with new requests(like JWT token) so just boolean flah accessible in single component would not be enough.\r\n 3. some operation on auth information like say `logout()` or `refreshToken()` will be probably needed in different components not in single one.\r\n\r\nBut finally it&#39;s up to you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419982/how-connect-context-with-redirect/58420176#58420176","title":"How connect Context with Redirect"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":12225354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1rC2XakNqz0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfTCEKi6mstcbR-V2tDgPVGaH9ODw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mattxml","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225354/mattxml"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338682,"creation_date":1571338682,"answer_id":58439135,"question_id":58419982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439135","body_markdown":"Thanks **skyboyer**\r\nI solved this problem with Context method .I will try tell you how i do this becouse maybe someone will have the same problem\r\nI created new file \r\n```\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\nimport { Redirect } from &quot;react-router&quot;;\r\nconst LoginInfo = React.createContext();\r\n\r\nexport const LoginInfoProvider = props =&gt; {\r\n  const [infoLog, setInfoLog] = React.useState(&quot;&quot;);\r\n  const login = name =&gt; {\r\n    setInfoLog(name);\r\n  };\r\n  const logout = () =&gt; {\r\n    setInfoLog(&quot;old&quot;);\r\n  };\r\n  const { children } = props;\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;LoginInfo.Provider\r\n      value={{\r\n        login: login,\r\n        logout: logout,\r\n        infolog: infoLog\r\n      }}\r\n    &gt;\r\n      {children}\r\n    &lt;/LoginInfo.Provider&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport const LoginInfoConsumer = LoginInfo.Consumer;\r\n```\r\nIn ```App.js``` add ```LoginInfoProvider```\r\n```\r\n&lt;Router&gt;\r\n &lt;LoginInfoProvider&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={Login} /&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/register&quot; component={Register} /&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/page&quot; component={Page} /&gt;\r\n &lt;/LoginInfoProvider&gt;\r\n&lt;/Router&gt;\r\n```\r\nIn page with login (parts of code in my question) i added ```LoginInfoConsumer```\r\n```\r\n&lt;LoginInfoConsumer&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419982/how-connect-context-with-redirect/58439135#58439135","title":"How connect Context with Redirect"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":12225354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1rC2XakNqz0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfTCEKi6mstcbR-V2tDgPVGaH9ODw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mattxml","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225354/mattxml"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58420176,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338682,"creation_date":1571252142,"question_id":58419982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58419982","body_markdown":"I want to send information to second page if the user is logged in .

This special class introduces it&#39;s own .NET type wrappers. Instead of `string` you will get `BsonString`, instead of `int` we have `BsonInt32` and so on.

Non dependencies are also being logged when running as an App Service (Requests, Exceptions, Traces, etc).  Additionally, when running locally, I&#39;m able to see all dependencies logged as expected - this problem appears to only happen when using Azure App Services.\r\n\r\nHere is the current setup:\r\n\r\n - C# Web Application .NET 4.7 AppInsights is installed via NuGet\r\n    packages\r\n - ApplicationInsights.config file is in web app&#39;s root folder\r\n - The Application_Start method in Global.asax.cs sets the\r\n - TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey value to the corresponding app insights key (I&#39;ve confirmed this is being properly set to the proper app insights resource)\r\n\r\nHere is what I&#39;ve tried doing:\r\n\r\n- Confirmed that the app insights dlls and ApplicationInsights.config files are all properly deployed to the App Service by using the &quot;App Service Editor&quot;\r\n- Installing the &quot;Application Insights extension for Azure App Service&quot; extension (version 2.6.5) to the web app\r\n- Enable Application Insights within the web app itself by navigating the &quot;Application Insights&quot; then selected enabled under &quot;Collect application monitoring data using Application Insights&quot;. All other settings for app insights I enabled on that same page\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is any other additional info that would be helpful to provide.\r\n\r\npackages.config relevant

But it is an important question, since the concept of reactivity and how to access it is very hard to grasp when you come from a pure non reactive R environment.\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple example app which shows how to access vectors in reactive data frames, and how they could be used.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps to get a better understanding of reactivity in shiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    library(shiny)\r\n    \r\n    shinyApp(ui = fluidPage(\r\n      \r\n      sidebarLayout(\r\n        \r\n        sidebarPanel(\r\n        selectInput(inputId = &quot;cyl&quot;,\r\n                    label = &quot;Number cylinders:&quot;,\r\n                    choices = c(&quot;all&quot;,sort(unique(mtcars$cyl))),\r\n                    selected = &quot;all&quot;),\r\n        actionButton(&quot;capture&quot;,\r\n                     &quot;capture value&quot;)\r\n        \r\n      ), # closes sidebarPanel\r\n      \r\n    \r\n        mainPanel(\r\n    \r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text2&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text3&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;table&quot;)\r\n    \r\n      ) # closes mainPanel\r\n      ) # closes sidebarLayout    \r\n    \r\n    ), # closes fluidPage\r\n    \r\n      server = function(input, output) {\r\n        \r\n    # some example reactive data    \r\n    cars_react &lt;- reactive({\r\n      \r\n      mtcars %&gt;% \r\n        filter(cyl == input$cyl | input$cyl == &quot;all&quot;)\r\n        \r\n      })\r\n        \r\n    # simply global assignment of a reactive vector\r\n    observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n        \r\n        # here is a globally assigned vector taken from the reactive data\r\n        # reused in a render statement it will not react to change, since it is not reactive \r\n\r\n        test_vec3 &lt;&lt;- unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n        \r\n        })\r\n\r\n      # here a file is written to the working directory of your shiny app\r\n      # everytime cars_react() changes write (and overwrite) vector to a file \r\n      observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n        \r\n        test_vec = unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n        \r\n        saveRDS(test_vec, file = &quot;test_vec.Rdata&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        })\r\n      \r\n      # same as above but the file is gradually growing and not overwritten\r\n      # everytime cars_react() changes add vector to a (over several sessions growing) list\r\n      observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n    \r\n        test_vec2 = unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n    \r\n        if (file.exists(&quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)) {\r\n    \r\n          temp = readRDS(&quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)\r\n    \r\n          test_list = c(temp, list(test_vec2))\r\n    \r\n        } else {\r\n    \r\n        test_list = list(test_vec2)\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        saveRDS(test_list, file = &quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      })\r\n      \r\n      # here we access the reactive data with isolate and make it non-reactive, but can update the values through a button click\r\n      text_vec &lt;- eventReactive(input$capture, {\r\n        \r\n        isolate(unique(cars_react()$hp))\r\n        \r\n      })\r\n    \r\n      # output of our reactive data as table\r\n      output$table &lt;- renderTable({\r\n        \r\n        cars_react()\r\n      \r\n        })   \r\n    \r\n      # text output of globally assigned non-reactive vector test_vec3 (not changing!)\r\n      output$text &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        test_vec3\r\n        \r\n      })   \r\n      \r\n      # you can capture values of reactives with isolate, but then, they don&#39;t change anymore \r\n      # text output of isolated formely reactive vector unique(cars_react()$hp (not changing!)\r\n      output$text2 &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        isolate(unique(cars_react()$hp))\r\n        \r\n      })   \r\n      \r\n      # text output of new reactive vector (changes when input$capture button is clicked)\r\n      output$text3 &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        text_vec()\r\n        \r\n      })  \r\n     \r\n      }\r\n      \r\n    )","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419967/storing-a-reactive-output-in-a-vector-shiny-r/58421490#58421490","title":"Storing a reactive output in a vector -

My research has not shown me clear 2019 solutions to this. I have found [this](https://pythonistaplanet.com/how-to-create-a-django-project-in-anaconda-very-easily/) which appears to start launching the boilerplate code directory structure directly in the djangoenv. I may need this ironed out in my head, but I thought we use the creation of the environment separate from the code we wish to run with it.\r\n\r\nI have a MBP with Mojave 10.14.6 using VSCode and conda to manage my environments for Pyhton. I am a little confused on where I should be creating a directory structure with the manange.py and where I should be having an environment built from. I think the top level django application directory needs to be created with a `mkdir` and the resulting .env file should be frozen from within that structure by first creating a conda environment and installing django there, then using conda list --export to freeze the environment created. \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nconda create --name django-app python=3.7.4\r\nconda activate django-app\r\n\r\n# installs to the\r\n\r\n## Package Plan ##\r\n\r\n  environment location: /Users/me/anaconda3/envs/django-app\r\n\r\nconda install django\r\n\r\n## Package Plan ##\r\n\r\n  environment location: /Users/me/anaconda3/envs/django-app\r\n\r\n  added / updated specs:\r\n    - django\r\n```\r\nThen creating the actual application project dierctory:\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir dj-test \r\ncd dj-test\r\nconda list --export &gt; requirements.txt \r\n\r\nI now wish to issue the code to create the working directory and manage.py\r\n```sh\r\ndjango-admin startproject dj-test\r\n```\r\nDid I just skip an actual install of the environment for running the application in this directory? I found [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/) for pip but do I need something like this for conda too:\r\n```sh\r\ndjango-app/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\nI am trying to follow a PyCharm tutorial that may be creating the environment and top level directory in the background. I would expect I am close to getting the beginning started, I just started getting a little apprehensive to get further into this framework without a good starting point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419964/how-to-use-conda-and-django-admin-startproject-properly-in-2019","title":"How to use conda and django-admin startproject properly in 2019"},{"tags":["python-3.x","scipy","scipy-spatial"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571267742,"post_id":58419963,"comment_id":103187813,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419963/scipy-vs-matlab-3d-rotations-matrix#comment103187813_58419963"},{"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":8571015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96b7a8dc2c52891db1262c239d0889bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JakobJakobson13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8571015/jakobjakobson13"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571299773,"post_id":58419963,"comment_id":103196749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419963/scipy-vs-matlab-3d-rotations-matrix#comment103196749_58419963"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":8571015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96b7a8dc2c52891db1262c239d0889bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JakobJakobson13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8571015/jakobjakobson13"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18155,"user_id":353337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/500a1e2e864ae08f386afde2cd21add0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico Schl&#246;mer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/353337/nico-schl%c3%b6mer"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571857294,"creation_date":1571252067,"last_edit_date":1571857294,"question_id":58419963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58419963","body_markdown":"I compared the outputs of scipy and MATLAB functions for creating 3D rotation matrices and the two programs showed different results.\r\n\r\nFirst SciPys [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html#scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation):\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; R.from_euler(&#39;zyz&#39;, [np.pi/2, np.pi/2, 0]).as_dcm()\r\narray([[ 0.00000000e+00, -2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00],\r\n       [ 1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16,  0.00000000e+00],\r\n       [-2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16]])\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; R.from_euler(&#39;zyz&#39;, [0, np.pi/2, np.pi/2]).as_dcm()\r\narray([[ 0.00000000e+00, -1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16],\r\n       [ 2.22044605e-16,  2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00],\r\n       [-1.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow matlabs [eul2rotm](https://de.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/eul2rotm.html) function:\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt; eul2rotm([pi/2 pi/2 0], &#39;ZYZ&#39;)\r\n\r\nans =\r\n\r\n    0.0000   -1.0000    0.0000\r\n    0.0000    0.0000    1.0000\r\n   -1.0000         0    0.0000\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; eul2rotm([0 pi/2 pi/2], &#39;ZYZ&#39;)\r\n\r\nans =\r\n\r\n    0.0000   -0.0000    1.0000\r\n    1.0000    0.0000         0\r\n   -0.0000    1.0000    0.0000\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the end, the order how the rotations are applied seem to differ.

each time you call `getInfoAPI()` `http.get()` creates a new observable, and `shareReplay()` shares that new observable, it doesn&#39;t merge two calls. If you want the caller to get a merged observable, you can return the same observable from both calls. But it&#39;s wrong solution, I&#39;ll explain it later. For example:\r\n```typescript\r\nexport class DataService {\r\n  private readonly getInfoRequest = new Subject&lt;GetInfoRequest&gt;();\r\n  private readonly getInfoResponse = this.getInfoRequest.pipe(\r\n    exhaustMap(request =&gt; { \r\n      const callURL = createGetInfoUrl(request);\r\n      const callParams = createGetInfoParams(request);\r\n      return this.http.get(callURL, callParams).pipe(\r\n        retryWhen( ... );\r\n      );\r\n    })\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  public getInfoAPI(category:string, id:string = &quot;&quot;, page:string = &quot;1&quot;, limit:string = &quot;10&quot;) {\r\n    this.getInfoRequest.next({ category: category, id: id, page: page, limit: limit });\r\n    return this.getInfoResponse;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe code above does the same thing, that you are trying to implement by `shareReplay()`, but what if the calls arguments doesn&#39;t match? One component has requested the first page, but an other component has requested the second, the second component will receive the first page instead of the second. So, we should consider the call parameters too, the things become more complicated.\r\n\r\nA solution could be to wrap the HttpService with a repository, which will handle the caching, it could cache data in memory, inside a database or somewhere else, but I doubt that it&#39;s what you want. As I understand the problem is simultaneous requests, the better way is to prevent such request. For example, if a request is triggered by a button click, just disable the button while a request is executing, or skip repeated requests. It&#39;s the usual way to solve such problems.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419948/angular-rxjs-keeping-track-of-http-requests-stuck-in-retry-mode/58470082#58470082","title":"Angular/RXJS - Keeping track of HTTP requests stuck in retry mode"}],"owner":{"reputation":1148,"user_id":2207792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b3a458b9e93134fd6c9bef380efa3bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mercurial","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2207792/mercurial"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1592,"user_id":2466342,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/C4hkq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"terahertz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2466342/terahertz"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":102,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"bounty_amount":50,"bounty_closes_date":1572121120,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571572289,"creation_date":1571252005,"last_edit_date":1571572289,"question_id":58419948,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58419948","body_markdown":"I have a function which is handling multiple APIs request for me and puts each request in Retry mode if failed.

Quaternion.FromToRotation(hoverRB.transform.up, Vector3.up);\r\n\r\nThen use [`Quaternion.ToAngleAxis`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.ToAngleAxis.html) to convert that to an angle &amp; axis:\r\n\r\n    Vector3 axis;\r\n    float angle\r\n    deltaQuat.ToAngleAxis(out angle, out axis);\r\n\r\nThen, cancel out some of any existing rotation so that you&#39;ll eventually

it.\r\n\r\nMake sure this is all being done in `FixedUpdate` (or a function called/running in `FixedUpdate` time) due to how the torque&#39;s direction will likely need to change from one physics step

the following scenario from the Wumpus world. One dark and stormy night, the Wumpus found a treasure stash he hid many years ago. In the stash were several small gold objects and it also contained a few bottles of batshine (slang for illicitly distilled liquor in the Wumpus world). The Wumpus became exalted by this find and drank all the liquor. After having done so, he became paranoid about the small gold objects and decided to hide them in the cave system. Thus, he stumbled around in a drunken haze and carefully buried one gold object each in a number of randomly selected caves. In the process of doing this, he unexpectedly found the exit and, dazed and confused from the batshine, ventured outside and got lost. He still has not found his way back. Our intrepid agent Laura has now heard that the Wumpus is gone and that there might be some buried treasures in the cave system. She has decided to risk exploring the caves and look for the buried gold whilst the Wumpus is away. However, since the Wumpus can return at any time, she wants to be as quick as possible and not dig in caves unlikely to contain hidden treasures.\r\nNow, suppose the cave system contains 100 caves, of which 90 caves are without a hidden treasure and 10 caves contain a buried gold object. In 70% of the caves with a hidden treasure, the Wumpus has left behind his usual stench from digging about and bumping into walls. In the remaining caves with hidden treasures in them, the Wumpus has left no trace, i.e. they are non-smelly. Furthermore, all the caves without a hidden treasure are free from smell, since the Wumpus has fled the cave system. The agent is now located in a random cave and can perceive that it is not smelly. What is the probability that this cave contains a hidden treasure?\r\nSolve this problem using Bayes formula, and carefully explain and motivate what the different probabilities you use stand for, and how you obtain their values.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420183/what-is-the-probability-that-this-cave-contains-a-hidden-treasure","title":"What is the probability that this cave contains a hidden treasure?"},{"tags":["r","list","function","loops","dataframe"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571260456,"post_id":58420684,"comment_id":103185751,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420181/extracting-from-a-list-of-list-of-data-frames-in-r/58420684#comment103185751_58420684"},{"owner":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571260692,"post_id":58420684,"comment_id":103185827,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420181/extracting-from-a-list-of-list-of-data-frames-in-r/58420684#comment103185827_58420684"},{"owner":{"reputation":316,"user_id":8840683,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-g37hRPxRygA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIs/jc494ilHD28/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8840683/reza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571260741,"post_id":58420684,"comment_id":103185850,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420181/extracting-from-a-list-of-list-of-data-frames-in-r/58420684#comment103185850_58420684"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571255152,"creation_date":1571255152,"answer_id":58420684,"question_id":58420181,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420684","body_markdown":"I think this function should extract what you need.\r\n\r\n    foo &lt;- function(G, val=&quot;dint&quot;, cols = c(&quot;short&quot;, &quot;del1&quot;, &quot;del2&quot;)) {\r\n      named &lt;- function(x, n) {if (is.null(x)) x else setNames(list(x), n)}  \r\n      Map(function(col) Map(function(n) named(G[[n]][[col]][[val]], col), names(G)), cols)\r\n    }\r\n        \r\n    dints &lt;- foo(G, &quot;dint&quot;)\r\n    SDs &lt;- foo(G, &quot;SD&quot;)\r\n\r\nI used lists rather than named vectors for the inner most values.

In consequence, now each row has a greater height due to text breadlines.\r\n\r\nI need the input fields weight to obey column size and that the column width remain as if the input field was not there.      \r\n\r\nThe original code is more or less like: \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!doctype html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- Required meta tags --&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!-- Bootstrap CSS --&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-Gn5384xqQ1aoWXA+058RXPxPg6fy4IWvTNh0E263XmFcJlSAwiGgFAW/dAiS6JXm&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n  &lt;body&gt;\r\n   &lt;div container&gt;\r\n\r\n   &lt;table class=&quot;table table-striped table-hover table-sm small&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Project &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Line &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Code &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Pay Item &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Code &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Material &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Accept. &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Test &lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Status &lt;/th&gt;\r\n\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Actions&lt;/th&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n        &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                \r\n                &lt;td&gt;10D276 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;0020 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;203.30 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;EARTH BORROW &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;703.02&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;Earth Borrow&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;Test&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;AG-COMP-15&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;               \r\n                &lt;td&gt;\r\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;# &quot; class=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot; title=&quot;Show&quot;&gt;zoom_in&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    \r\n                    &lt;a href=&quot;# &quot; class=&quot;zoom&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;material-icons&quot; title=&quot;Action&quot;&gt;directions&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;    \r\n                &lt;/td&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;10D276 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;0510 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;580.20 &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;RAPID SETTING CONCRETE REPAIR MATERIAL WITH COARSE AGGREGATE &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;780.04&lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;td&gt;Rapid Set Concrete Material with C.

are correct that `B.v = 3` simply overwrites the descriptor with an integer (as it should).\r\n\r\nFor `B.v = 3` to invoke a descriptor, the descriptor should have been defined on the metaclass, i.e. on `type(B)`.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; class BMeta(type): \r\n    ...     v = VocalDescriptor() \r\n    ... \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; class B(metaclass=BMeta): \r\n    ...     pass \r\n    ... \r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; B.v = 3 \r\n    __set__\r\n\r\nTo invoke the descriptor on `B`, you would use an instance: `B().v = 3` will do it.\r\n\r\nThe reason for `B.v` invoking the getter is to allow returning the descriptor instance itself.  Usually you would do that, to allow access on the descriptor via the class object:\r\n\r\n    class VocalDescriptor(object):\r\n        def __get__(self, obj, objtype):\r\n            if obj is None:\r\n                return self\r\n            print(&#39;__get__, obj={}, objtype={}&#39;.format(obj, objtype))\r\n        def __set__(self, obj, val):\r\n            print(&#39;__set__&#39;)\r\n\r\nNow `B.v` would return some instance like `&lt;mymodule.VocalDescriptor object at 0xdeadbeef&gt;` which you can interact with. It is literally the descriptor object, defined as a class attribute, and its state `B.v.__dict__` is shared between all instances of `B`.\r\n\r\nOf course it is up to user&#39;s code to define exactly what they want `B.v` to do, returning `self` is just the common pattern.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420173/why-does-setting-a-descriptor-on-a-class-overwrite-the-descriptor/58420458#58420458","title":"Why does setting a descriptor on a class overwrite the descriptor?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":293226,"user_id":1126841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa05233b2357f8d11c22ef4cfc7bb85c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chepner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1126841/chepner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571254710,"creation_date":1571254710,"answer_id":58420594,"question_id":58420173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420594","body_markdown":"Barring any overrides, `B.v` is equivalent to `type.__getattribute__(B, &quot;v&quot;)`, while `b = B(); b.v` is equivalent to `object.__getattribute__(b, &quot;v&quot;)`.

Warning:  i went into the weeds.  I&#39;m really hoping I can get help from [a captain who knows those waters][2].  I tried to be as explicit as possible in tracing the calls I was looking at, for my own future benefit and the benefit of future readers.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen a lot of ink spilled over the behavior of `__getattribute__` applied to descriptors, e.g. lookup precedence.  The Python snippet in [&quot;Invoking Descriptors&quot;][3] just below `For classes, the machinery is in type.__getattribute__()...` roughly agrees in my mind with what I believe is the corresponding [CPython source][4] in `type_getattro`, which I tracked down by looking at [&quot;tp_slots&quot;][5] then [where tp_getattro is populated][6].  And the fact that `B.v` initially prints `__get__, obj=None, objtype=&lt;class &#39;__main__.B&#39;&gt;` makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nWhat I don&#39;t understand is, why does the assignment `B.v = 3` blindly overwrite the descriptor, rather than triggering `v.__set__`?  I tried to trace the CPython call, starting once more from [&quot;tp_slots&quot;][5], then looking at [where tp_setattro is populated][7], then looking at [type_setattro][8].  `type_setattro` [appears to be][9] a thin wrapper around [_PyObject_GenericSetAttrWithDict][10].  And there&#39;s the crux of my confusion:  `_PyObject_GenericSetAttrWithDict` appears to have [logic that gives precedence to a descriptor&#39;s `__set__` method][11]!!  With this in mind, I can&#39;t figure out why `B.v = 3` blindly overwrites `v` rather than triggering `v.__set__`.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer 1:  I did not rebuild Python from source with printfs, so I&#39;m not \r\ncompletely sure `type_setattro` is what&#39;s being called during `B.v = 3`.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer 2:  `VocalDescriptor` is not intended to exemplify &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;recommended&quot; descriptor definition.  It&#39;s a verbose no-op to tell me when the methods are being called.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57273021/setting-class-attributes-does-not-use-descriptor-setter\r\n  [2]:

Means  you consume one message at a time get process and published to another topic and commit. So commit will be handle by Stream automatically one message a time. \r\nkafka Stream achieve these be setting below parameters which can not be overwrite \r\n\r\n&gt;  - isolation.level: (read_committed) - Consumers will always read    committed data only   \r\n&gt;  - enable.idempotence: (true) - Producer will always have idempotency    enabled\r\n&gt;  - max.in.flight.requests.per.connection&quot; (5) - Producer will always       have one in-flight request per connection\r\n\r\nIn case any error in consumer or producer kafka stream always retry specific configured number of attempt. \r\nKafkaStream doesn&#39;t guarantee inside processing logic we still need to handle e.g. there is requirement for DB operation and if DB connection got failed in that case Kafka doesn&#39;t aware  so you need to handle by your own.\r\n\r\nAs per pattern definition yes we need consumer , process and producer topic but in general it&#39;s not stopping you if you don&#39;t output to another topic.

use gattool to connect with BLE device on Linux virtual machine(Ubuntu). There are three roles in the system: peripheral, central, and laptop(only receiving logging info for debugging)\r\n\r\nAfter connecting, I need to send out a message to the peripheral so that it will send out logging information to Linux when the central interacts with the peripheral. So my code is like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconnect\r\n# cmd for the peripheral sending out logging\r\nchar-write-cmd 0x000f 70\r\n# enable notification\r\nchar-write-req 0x000c 0100 --listen\r\n```\r\nIt can print out the notification normally, if the peripheral can keep sending out logging to laptop. But if the peripheral stops sending out the logging for (4-5) seconds, and resumes after that, the laptop will no longer print out the message. But it is not disconnected, because I can still write to the peripheral and receive normal feedback after that. And also no error like `(gatttool:5840): GLib-WARNING **: Invalid file descriptor.`\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the possible reason for it and how can to fix it?

From u/inio on Reddit:\r\n\r\n&gt; So usually for phone form-factor devices there will be a 90&#176; rotation between the camera coordinate system (which is defined to have +x point in the diction of the horizontal axis of the physical camera image, typically the long axis of the device) and the android sensor coordinate system (which has +y pointing away from the android navigation buttons, and +x thus along the short axis of the device). The difference you describe is an 88.8&#176; rotation. Maybe you want the virtual camera pose? [Source][1]\r\n\r\nI tested with using the getDisplayOrientedPose(). With it, I get what I expect when I am in portrait mode. But, if I flip to landscape, then the coordinate system changes, and I am off by a 90&#176; rotation. So I instead did the rotation myself. \r\n```\r\npublic void processFrame(Frame frame) {\r\n    if (frame.getCamera().getTrackingState() != TrackingState.TRACKING) {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Get the magnetic vector in sensor that we stored in the onSensorChanged() delegate\r\n    float[] magneticVectorInSensor = {x,y,z};\r\n\r\n    // Get sensor to world\r\n    Pose sensorToWorldPose = frame.getAndroidSensorPose();\r\n\r\n    // Get camera to world\r\n    Pose cameraToWorldPose = frame.getCamera().getPose();\r\n\r\n    // +90&#176; rotation about Z\r\n    // https://github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/issues/535#issuecomment-418845833\r\n    Pose CAMERA_POSE_FIX = Pose.makeRotation(0, 0, ((float) Math.sqrt(0.5f)), ((float) Math.sqrt(0.5f))); \r\n    Pose rotatedCameraToWorldPose = cameraToWorldPose.compose(CAMERA_POSE_FIX);\r\n\r\n    // Get world to camera\r\n    Pose worldToCameraPose = rotatedCameraToWorldPose.inverse();\r\n\r\n    // Get sensor to camera\r\n    Pose sensorToCameraPose = worldToCameraPose.compose(sensorToWorldPose);\r\n\r\n    // Get the magnetic vector in camera coordinate space\r\n    float[] magneticVectorInCamera = sensorToCameraPose.rotateVector(magneticVectorInSensor);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/Arcore/comments/diu3te/how_to_convert_the_magnetic_field_vector_from/f47pwto?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420057/how-to-convert-the-magnetic-field-vector-from-sensor-coordinate-space-to-camera/58494661#58494661","title":"How to convert the magnetic field vector from sensor coordinate space to camera coordinate space?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10592859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbf4d9a441d79c226cac7a2e1644d21c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jerboa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10592859/jerboa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10592859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbf4d9a441d79c226cac7a2e1644d21c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jerboa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10592859/jerboa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58494661,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571695170,"creation_date":1571252468,"last_edit_date":1571260422,"question_id":58420057,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420057","body_markdown":"I would like to collect the magnetic field vector (i.e. x,y,z in microteslas) from the [TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD Position sensor][1] and put it in the same coordinate system that the [Frame&#39;s][2] we get from ARCore are in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field vector is in the [Sensor Coordinate System][3].

Since an `a` tag doesn&#39;t have to contain `href` parameters I guarded against retrieving any such tags by accident.\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ve got bugs, potential bugs and bad practices. Here are some untested but likely to work ways to fix them:\r\n\r\nRunning the code results in:\r\n\r\n    uninitialized constant KefotoScraper (NameError)\r\n\r\nIn your code you have `@service` and `@service_links` which are never initialized so...?\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t do this because it&#39;s cruel:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef home_html\r\n  Nokogiri::HTML(open(PAGE_URL))\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery time you call `home_html` you (re)open and (re)read the page from the remote site and wasting your and their CPU and network time. Instead, cache the parsed document in a variable kind of like you did in your commented-out line using HTTParty. It&#39;s much more friendly to not hit sites repeatedly and helps avoid getting banned.\r\n\r\nMoving on:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef service_names\r\n  @service_names = home_html.css(&quot;.nav-link&quot;).map do\r\n    |link| link[&#39;href&#39;].to_s.gsub(/.php/, &quot;&quot;)\r\n  end\r\n  @service_names.each do |pr|\r\n    @@product_names &lt;&lt; pr\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;d use something like `get_product_names` and return the array like I did in Nokogiri above:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_product_names\r\n  get_html.css(&#39;.nav-link[href]&#39;).map { |l|\r\n    l[&#39;href&#39;].sub(/\\.php$/, &#39;&#39;)\r\n  }\r\nend\r\n:\r\n:\r\n@@product_names = get_product_names()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s why I&#39;d do it another way. You used:\r\n```\r\nlink[&#39;href&#39;].to_s.gsub(/.php/, &quot;&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\n 1. `to_s` is redundant because `link[&#39;href&#39;]` is already returning a string. Stringizing a string wastes brain cycles when rereading/debugging the code. Be kind to yourself and don&#39;t do that.\r\n\r\n        require &#39;nokogiri&#39;\r\n        html = &#39;&lt;a href=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;&#39;\r\n        doc = Nokogiri::HTML(html)\r\n        doc.at(&#39;a&#39;)[&#39;href&#39;] # =&gt; &quot;foo&quot;\r\n        doc.at(&#39;a&#39;)[&#39;href&#39;].class # =&gt; String\r\n\r\n 2. `gsub` Ew. How many occurrences of the target string do you anticipate to find and replace? If only one, which is extremely likely in a URL &quot;href&quot;, instead use `sub` because it&#39;s more efficient; It only runs once and moves on whereas `gsub` looks through the string at least one additional time to see if it needs to run again.\r\n 3. `/.php/` doesn&#39;t mean what you think it does, and it&#39;s a very subtle bug in waiting. `/.php/` means &quot;some character followed by &quot;php&quot;, but you most likely meant &quot;a period followed by &#39;php&#39;&quot;. This was something I used to see all the time because other programmers I worked with didn&#39;t bother to figure out what they were doing, and being the senior guy it was my job to pick their code apart and find bugs. Instead you should use `/\\.php/` which removes the special meaning of `.`, resulting in your desired pattern which is not going to trigger if it encounters `&quot;aphp&quot;` or something similar. See &quot;[Metacharacters and Escapes][1]&quot; and the following section on that page for more information.\r\n\r\n 4. On top of the above, the pattern needs to be anchored to avoid wasting more CPU. `/\\.php/` will cause the regular expression engine to start at the beginning of the string and walk through it until it reaches the end. As strings get longer that process gets slower, and in production code that is processing GB of data it can slow down a system markedly. Instead, using an anchor like `/\\.php$/` or `/\\.php\\z/` gives the engine a hint where it should start looking and can result in big speedups. I&#39;ve got some answers on SO that go into this, and the included benchmarks show how they help. See &quot;[Anchors][2]&quot; for more information.\r\n\r\nThat should help you but I didn&#39;t try modifying your code to see if it did.

It&#39;s maintained by the Chromium Project, while Chrome is maintained by Google. Aside from code-opennes, the main difference (for your concerning question) between the two browsers is that Google adds a number of proprietary features to Chrome like automatic updates and support for additional video formats. Also added is AAC, H.264, and MP3 support. Giving you acess to a wider variety of media content, like sites using HTML5 to stream H.264 videos. Both browsers include Opus, Theora, Vorbis, VP8, VP9, and WAV codecs. Chrome also includes a sandboxed Adobe Pepper API (PPAPI) Flash plug-in that updates along with.\r\nFrom a programmatic side, both support Google DevTools protocol with all of the flexibility and possibilities this brings, like browser automation using the popular *puppeteer*  Node.js runtime, allowing you to run automated tests either in head or headless environments. Both browsers use the Blink rendering engine and the V8 JavaScript engine, so both will give you same support for CSS, HTML and DOM parsing/rendering, and same JavaScript compatibility, functionality and performance. So the real difference is if you&#39;re developing media-content centric web apps, in that case you will benefit more from Chrome since it includes all of the above mentioned extra plugins and supported formats, all of this makes the web more accessible to it and provides a wider range of things you could do.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420050/are-google-chrome-and-chromium-equivalent-for-web-design-development/58420356#58420356","title":"Are Google Chrome and Chromium equivalent for web design/development?"}],"owner":{"reputation":131,"user_id":10580177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d326564acee958563c90144aa3bee5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sekhemty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10580177/sekhemty"},"last_editor":{"reputation":131,"user_id":10580177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d326564acee958563c90144aa3bee5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sekhemty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10580177/sekhemty"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571411607,"creation_date":1571252432,"last_edit_date":1571260830,"question_id":58420050,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420050","body_markdown":"This is probably a silly question, however: from a Web Design/Development point of view (I mean support for web standards and web technologies), could Google Chrome and Chromium be considered equivalent?\r\n\r\nI know that they are essentially the same browser, the former being the branded version of the latter, but they also have some functional differences, and Google Chrome features some additions not present in the base Chromium browser (detailed on the [Chromium page][1] on Wikipedia).\r\n\r\nThey use the Blink engine, which is in turn also used by other Chromium-based browsers like MS Edge and Opera; and all these browsers have an uneven support for many different web technologies, as detailed on https://caniuse.com.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m working on a Linux machine, and my distro ships Chromium by default, providing it from its standard repo; for the sake of simplicity and keeping things clean, I would prefer to avoid adding another external repo and install Chrome just for this task, if I can rely Chromium to behave exactly the same and not have any compatibility issue.\r\n\r\nLike I said, this question is probably silly, but given the differences between other Chromium-based browsers, maybe this doubt of mine could be justified. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Please note that I&#39;m not interested in the differences between Google Chrome and Chromium from an user point of view or in details of their history and so on; I only wish to know if from a website development point of view, they are fully compatible or if they support the same set of features. **In other words, if I test a site from Chromium, can I be sure that it will work also in Google Chrome?

entering a dropdown value in a column, if this is the first use of that dropdown value, then you want to create a sheet with the name of the dropdown value. If it isn&#39;t the first use, then there is no action (other than to populate the dropdown).\r\n\r\nThis requires a combination of factors:detecting the dropdown, ensuring it is in the right sheet, column and row, determining whether the value has been used before and, if not, to create the new sheet. There are probably many ways that this might be done; consider the following just one example.\r\n\r\nIn this example, the relevant sheet to watch is &quot;Sheet1&quot;, and the relevant column is &quot;Column A&quot;. There is one header row, and there are dropdown cells in the rows below the header row.\r\n\r\nThe logic flow is:\r\n\r\n - use a simple [onEdit(e) trigger](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/#onedite) to detect data entry.\r\n - use [Event objects](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/events) to determine the edited column, row, sheet name and value.\r\n - use other variables to manage the number of header rows, and the relevant column to watch.\r\n - create an `IF` statement to confirm that the edit was in the relevant sheet, column and row, then\r\n  - get the range and values in Column A - include row 1 so that `setValues()` will always apply\r\n  - flatten the resulting 2D array to 1D using the Javascript [`map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) method\r\n  - find the first and last occurence of the dropdown value in the range using Javascript [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) and [lastIndexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/lastIndexOf)\r\n  - if the first and last values are the same, then this must be the first and only use of the dropdown value, so create a new sheet [insertSheet(sheetName)](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/spreadsheet/spreadsheet#insertsheetsheetname) where &quot;sheetname&quot; is the dropdown value.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e){\r\n      \r\n      //so5842003001\r\n      \r\n      var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet()\r\n      var sheetname = &quot;Sheet1&quot;;\r\n      var sheet = ss.getSheetByName(sheetname);\r\n      \r\n      //Logger.log(JSON.stringify(e));//DEBUG\r\n      \r\n      var eColumn = e.range.getColumn();\r\n      var eRow = e.range.getRow();\r\n      var eSheet = e.source.getSheetName();\r\n      var eValue = e.value;\r\n      var headerrow = 1;

Obviously I cannot therefore use this strategy to get a reference to a `ChunkedWriteHandler` in order to call its `resumeTransfer()` method.\r\n\r\nMy question is: what strategy _should_ I use?

am working on a project for which I have created a small sample. \r\n\r\nDescription\r\n\r\nI wish to allow **three actions** to the user where he/she is allowed to select 3 different cell ranges one after the other. After selecting first range, a macro will run and capture 4 things, FromValue, ToValue, TimeDiff &amp; CABIN and dump those four values in Sheet2 in a tabular format. Then the next range will be selected by the user (second action) and values will be dumped below the previous one and then the third action. I am attaching a picture to demonstrate what I need to capture and dump. \r\n\r\nDisired output = Sheet2 should look like below after the **three actions**\r\n\r\n    01-Oct-2019 00:15 | 01-Oct-2019 01:00 | 00:45 | CABIN 1\t\t\t\r\n    01-Oct-2019 23:15 | 02-Oct-2019 01:00 | 01:45 | CABIN 2\t\t\t\r\n    02-Oct-2019 23:15 | 02-Oct-2019 23:30 | 00:15 | CABIN 2\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n\r\n - Cell B2 contains month and year in mmm-yyyy format.\r\n - The remaining cells in row 2 will have dates from 1 to 28/29/30/31 depending on  \r\n - which month it is.\r\n - Row 3 will have time values\r\n - Next rows will have Cabin names\r\n\r\nConditions\r\n\r\n1.

I thought maybe the sleep method would solve this issue but it isn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n- I can&#39;t add my server here. The code it way too complex. But i can say that i don&#39;t have functionality to closes incoming connections. So normally everything should stay up.\r\n\r\n- If you think there is a better way to do this, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420003/why-are-my-sockets-closing-after-a-certain-of-time","title":"Why are my sockets closing after a certain of time?"},{"tags":["reactjs","docker","express","kubernetes","google-bigquery"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255613,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183703,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183703_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255918,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183836,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183836_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255948,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103183856,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103183856_58420068"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571257497,"post_id":58420068,"comment_id":103184558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#comment103184558_58420068"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":15343,"user_id":3288890,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSQpx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adiii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3288890/adiii"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571252516,"creation_date":1571252516,"answer_id":58420068,"question_id":58420000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420068","body_markdown":"You can copy all required file from the host to docker image and it will able to access other required as same as you are accessing now.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nEXPOSE 8080\r\nWORKDIR /app\r\nCOPY . .\r\nCMD node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere `copy . .` will copy entire files and directories structure form the current context to `/app` of the docker image.\r\n\r\nSo I will suggest keeping only desired files in this context ( mean the directory where you place the dockerfile) to keep the image small.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58420000/how-to-containerize-multiple-files-with-docker/58420068#58420068","title":"How to Containerize multiple files with Docker"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":11384699,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-HqOM2Lm5bxg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdWmNvUWA5pzqQlXIt6OZi7uamnRQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Machine Learning","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11384699/machine-learning"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58420068,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571252516,"creation_date":1571252222,"question_id":58420000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58420000","body_markdown":"I created a simple application with reactjs/express.

I&#39;d expect you will need to store some authorization data to send with new requests(like JWT token) so just boolean flah accessible in single component would not be enough.\r\n 3. some operation on auth information like say `logout()` or `refreshToken()` will be probably needed in different components not in single one.\r\n\r\nBut finally it&#39;s up to you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419982/how-connect-context-with-redirect/58420176#58420176","title":"How connect Context with Redirect"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":12225354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1rC2XakNqz0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfTCEKi6mstcbR-V2tDgPVGaH9ODw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mattxml","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225354/mattxml"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338682,"creation_date":1571338682,"answer_id":58439135,"question_id":58419982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58439135","body_markdown":"Thanks **skyboyer**\r\nI solved this problem with Context method .I will try tell you how i do this becouse maybe someone will have the same problem\r\nI created new file \r\n```\r\nimport React from &quot;react&quot;;\r\nimport { Redirect } from &quot;react-router&quot;;\r\nconst LoginInfo = React.createContext();\r\n\r\nexport const LoginInfoProvider = props =&gt; {\r\n  const [infoLog, setInfoLog] = React.useState(&quot;&quot;);\r\n  const login = name =&gt; {\r\n    setInfoLog(name);\r\n  };\r\n  const logout = () =&gt; {\r\n    setInfoLog(&quot;old&quot;);\r\n  };\r\n  const { children } = props;\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;LoginInfo.Provider\r\n      value={{\r\n        login: login,\r\n        logout: logout,\r\n        infolog: infoLog\r\n      }}\r\n    &gt;\r\n      {children}\r\n    &lt;/LoginInfo.Provider&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\nexport const LoginInfoConsumer = LoginInfo.Consumer;\r\n```\r\nIn ```App.js``` add ```LoginInfoProvider```\r\n```\r\n&lt;Router&gt;\r\n &lt;LoginInfoProvider&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot; component={Login} /&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/register&quot; component={Register} /&gt;\r\n  &lt;Route path=&quot;/page&quot; component={Page} /&gt;\r\n &lt;/LoginInfoProvider&gt;\r\n&lt;/Router&gt;\r\n```\r\nIn page with login (parts of code in my question) i added ```LoginInfoConsumer```\r\n```\r\n&lt;LoginInfoConsumer&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419982/how-connect-context-with-redirect/58439135#58439135","title":"How connect Context with Redirect"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":12225354,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1rC2XakNqz0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfTCEKi6mstcbR-V2tDgPVGaH9ODw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mattxml","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12225354/mattxml"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58420176,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571338682,"creation_date":1571252142,"question_id":58419982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58419982","body_markdown":"I want to send information to second page if the user is logged in .

This special class introduces it&#39;s own .NET type wrappers. Instead of `string` you will get `BsonString`, instead of `int` we have `BsonInt32` and so on.

Non dependencies are also being logged when running as an App Service (Requests, Exceptions, Traces, etc).  Additionally, when running locally, I&#39;m able to see all dependencies logged as expected - this problem appears to only happen when using Azure App Services.\r\n\r\nHere is the current setup:\r\n\r\n - C# Web Application .NET 4.7 AppInsights is installed via NuGet\r\n    packages\r\n - ApplicationInsights.config file is in web app&#39;s root folder\r\n - The Application_Start method in Global.asax.cs sets the\r\n - TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey value to the corresponding app insights key (I&#39;ve confirmed this is being properly set to the proper app insights resource)\r\n\r\nHere is what I&#39;ve tried doing:\r\n\r\n- Confirmed that the app insights dlls and ApplicationInsights.config files are all properly deployed to the App Service by using the &quot;App Service Editor&quot;\r\n- Installing the &quot;Application Insights extension for Azure App Service&quot; extension (version 2.6.5) to the web app\r\n- Enable Application Insights within the web app itself by navigating the &quot;Application Insights&quot; then selected enabled under &quot;Collect application monitoring data using Application Insights&quot;. All other settings for app insights I enabled on that same page\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there is any other additional info that would be helpful to provide.\r\n\r\npackages.config relevant

But it is an important question, since the concept of reactivity and how to access it is very hard to grasp when you come from a pure non reactive R environment.\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple example app which shows how to access vectors in reactive data frames, and how they could be used.\r\n\r\nI hope it helps to get a better understanding of reactivity in shiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    library(shiny)\r\n    \r\n    shinyApp(ui = fluidPage(\r\n      \r\n      sidebarLayout(\r\n        \r\n        sidebarPanel(\r\n        selectInput(inputId = &quot;cyl&quot;,\r\n                    label = &quot;Number cylinders:&quot;,\r\n                    choices = c(&quot;all&quot;,sort(unique(mtcars$cyl))),\r\n                    selected = &quot;all&quot;),\r\n        actionButton(&quot;capture&quot;,\r\n                     &quot;capture value&quot;)\r\n        \r\n      ), # closes sidebarPanel\r\n      \r\n    \r\n        mainPanel(\r\n    \r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text2&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;text3&quot;),\r\n          tableOutput(&quot;table&quot;)\r\n    \r\n      ) # closes mainPanel\r\n      ) # closes sidebarLayout    \r\n    \r\n    ), # closes fluidPage\r\n    \r\n      server = function(input, output) {\r\n        \r\n    # some example reactive data    \r\n    cars_react &lt;- reactive({\r\n      \r\n      mtcars %&gt;% \r\n        filter(cyl == input$cyl | input$cyl == &quot;all&quot;)\r\n        \r\n      })\r\n        \r\n    # simply global assignment of a reactive vector\r\n    observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n        \r\n        # here is a globally assigned vector taken from the reactive data\r\n        # reused in a render statement it will not react to change, since it is not reactive \r\n\r\n        test_vec3 &lt;&lt;- unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n        \r\n        })\r\n\r\n      # here a file is written to the working directory of your shiny app\r\n      # everytime cars_react() changes write (and overwrite) vector to a file \r\n      observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n        \r\n        test_vec = unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n        \r\n        saveRDS(test_vec, file = &quot;test_vec.Rdata&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        })\r\n      \r\n      # same as above but the file is gradually growing and not overwritten\r\n      # everytime cars_react() changes add vector to a (over several sessions growing) list\r\n      observeEvent(cars_react(), {\r\n    \r\n        test_vec2 = unique(cars_react()$hp)\r\n    \r\n        if (file.exists(&quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)) {\r\n    \r\n          temp = readRDS(&quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)\r\n    \r\n          test_list = c(temp, list(test_vec2))\r\n    \r\n        } else {\r\n    \r\n        test_list = list(test_vec2)\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        saveRDS(test_list, file = &quot;test_list.Rdata&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      })\r\n      \r\n      # here we access the reactive data with isolate and make it non-reactive, but can update the values through a button click\r\n      text_vec &lt;- eventReactive(input$capture, {\r\n        \r\n        isolate(unique(cars_react()$hp))\r\n        \r\n      })\r\n    \r\n      # output of our reactive data as table\r\n      output$table &lt;- renderTable({\r\n        \r\n        cars_react()\r\n      \r\n        })   \r\n    \r\n      # text output of globally assigned non-reactive vector test_vec3 (not changing!)\r\n      output$text &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        test_vec3\r\n        \r\n      })   \r\n      \r\n      # you can capture values of reactives with isolate, but then, they don&#39;t change anymore \r\n      # text output of isolated formely reactive vector unique(cars_react()$hp (not changing!)\r\n      output$text2 &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        isolate(unique(cars_react()$hp))\r\n        \r\n      })   \r\n      \r\n      # text output of new reactive vector (changes when input$capture button is clicked)\r\n      output$text3 &lt;- renderText({\r\n        \r\n        text_vec()\r\n        \r\n      })  \r\n     \r\n      }\r\n      \r\n    )","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419967/storing-a-reactive-output-in-a-vector-shiny-r/58421490#58421490","title":"Storing a reactive output in a vector -

My research has not shown me clear 2019 solutions to this. I have found [this](https://pythonistaplanet.com/how-to-create-a-django-project-in-anaconda-very-easily/) which appears to start launching the boilerplate code directory structure directly in the djangoenv. I may need this ironed out in my head, but I thought we use the creation of the environment separate from the code we wish to run with it.\r\n\r\nI have a MBP with Mojave 10.14.6 using VSCode and conda to manage my environments for Pyhton. I am a little confused on where I should be creating a directory structure with the manange.py and where I should be having an environment built from. I think the top level django application directory needs to be created with a `mkdir` and the resulting .env file should be frozen from within that structure by first creating a conda environment and installing django there, then using conda list --export to freeze the environment created. \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nconda create --name django-app python=3.7.4\r\nconda activate django-app\r\n\r\n# installs to the\r\n\r\n## Package Plan ##\r\n\r\n  environment location: /Users/me/anaconda3/envs/django-app\r\n\r\nconda install django\r\n\r\n## Package Plan ##\r\n\r\n  environment location: /Users/me/anaconda3/envs/django-app\r\n\r\n  added / updated specs:\r\n    - django\r\n```\r\nThen creating the actual application project dierctory:\r\n```sh\r\nmkdir dj-test \r\ncd dj-test\r\nconda list --export &gt; requirements.txt \r\n\r\nI now wish to issue the code to create the working directory and manage.py\r\n```sh\r\ndjango-admin startproject dj-test\r\n```\r\nDid I just skip an actual install of the environment for running the application in this directory? I found [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/) for pip but do I need something like this for conda too:\r\n```sh\r\ndjango-app/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n```\r\nI am trying to follow a PyCharm tutorial that may be creating the environment and top level directory in the background. I would expect I am close to getting the beginning started, I just started getting a little apprehensive to get further into this framework without a good starting point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419964/how-to-use-conda-and-django-admin-startproject-properly-in-2019","title":"How to use conda and django-admin startproject properly in 2019"},{"tags":["python-3.x","scipy","scipy-spatial"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571267742,"post_id":58419963,"comment_id":103187813,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419963/scipy-vs-matlab-3d-rotations-matrix#comment103187813_58419963"},{"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":8571015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96b7a8dc2c52891db1262c239d0889bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JakobJakobson13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8571015/jakobjakobson13"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":130226,"user_id":901925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8bbd70aaeb3a97d0087daf93c2be8804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"hpaulj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/901925/hpaulj"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571299773,"post_id":58419963,"comment_id":103196749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58419963/scipy-vs-matlab-3d-rotations-matrix#comment103196749_58419963"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":8571015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/96b7a8dc2c52891db1262c239d0889bd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JakobJakobson13","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8571015/jakobjakobson13"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18155,"user_id":353337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/500a1e2e864ae08f386afde2cd21add0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nico Schl&#246;mer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/353337/nico-schl%c3%b6mer"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571857294,"creation_date":1571252067,"last_edit_date":1571857294,"question_id":58419963,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58419963","body_markdown":"I compared the outputs of scipy and MATLAB functions for creating 3D rotation matrices and the two programs showed different results.\r\n\r\nFirst SciPys [scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation.html#scipy.spatial.transform.Rotation):\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; import numpy as np\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from scipy.spatial.transform import Rotation as R\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; R.from_euler(&#39;zyz&#39;, [np.pi/2, np.pi/2, 0]).as_dcm()\r\narray([[ 0.00000000e+00, -2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00],\r\n       [ 1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16,  0.00000000e+00],\r\n       [-2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16]])\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; R.from_euler(&#39;zyz&#39;, [0, np.pi/2, np.pi/2]).as_dcm()\r\narray([[ 0.00000000e+00, -1.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16],\r\n       [ 2.22044605e-16,  2.22044605e-16,  1.00000000e+00],\r\n       [-1.00000000e+00,  0.00000000e+00,  2.22044605e-16]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow matlabs [eul2rotm](https://de.mathworks.com/help/robotics/ref/eul2rotm.html) function:\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt; eul2rotm([pi/2 pi/2 0], &#39;ZYZ&#39;)\r\n\r\nans =\r\n\r\n    0.0000   -1.0000    0.0000\r\n    0.0000    0.0000    1.0000\r\n   -1.0000         0    0.0000\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt; eul2rotm([0 pi/2 pi/2], &#39;ZYZ&#39;)\r\n\r\nans =\r\n\r\n    0.0000   -0.0000    1.0000\r\n    1.0000    0.0000         0\r\n   -0.0000    1.0000    0.0000\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in the end, the order how the rotations are applied seem to differ.
