There are size limits which you can modify, and its good practice if you are having trouble with such a code, to check the return pointer for NULL after that `malloc()` call.  If it is NULL, that is the API method to signal an error (usually meaning you ran out of allocation space on the &quot;device heap&quot;).\r\n\r\nA pointer allocated in this fashion **cannot** participate in (be used in) any host API for data movement, such as `cudaMemcpy`.  It is usable/accessible from device code only.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the `malloc()` operation, like most device code you write, is performed *per-thread*.  Each thread that executes the `malloc()` call will do so independently, and each thread (assuming no failures) will receive a separate pointer, to a separate allocation.  However all such pointers are usable subsequently by any code running on that device, until they are explictly freed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356796/is-the-memory-allocated-using-malloc-inside-kernel-accessible-by-threads-of-othe/58356852#58356852","title":"Is the memory allocated using

you have figured it out changing the `booking_id` to `char booking_id[6]` will fix your current problem. However consider the following points for improvement in your code:\r\n\r\n 1. Make the fields `booking_id` and `airline_id` reasonably big enough like `100` chars to accommodate error handling. It will be much better if you can make them dynamic as well.\r\n 2. Make `booking_id` private\r\n 3. Make `calculateBookingID()` a private class method. Try avoiding free functions while coding in C++\r\n 4. Use [strcpy_s][1] instead of `strcpy` as the later is depricated.\r\n 5. Avoid global scope objects, instead create `b1 and b2` inside `main()` where you need them.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strcpy-s-wcscpy-s-mbscpy-s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356780/extra-characters-getting-added-in-c-for-char-array-data-type/58357681#58357681","title":"Extra Characters getting added in C++ for char array data type"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":3852287,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1517890098/picture?type=large","display_name":"Abinash Nanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3852287/abinash-nanda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10779,"user_id":9609840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XXYCB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JeJo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9609840/jejo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58357681,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570955704,"creation_date":1570901841,"last_edit_date":1570955704,"question_id":58356780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58356780","body_markdown":"I have the following code, where the booking_id is calculated using a function.\r\n```\r\nvoid calculateBookingID(char* id);\r\nclass BookFlight\r\n{\r\npublic:\r\n    char booking_id[5];\r\n    void addBooking()\r\n    {\r\n        string dummy;\r\n        calculateBookingID(booking_id);\r\n        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter Airline ID : &quot;;\r\n        cin.getline(airline_id,3);             \r\n\r\n    }\r\n    void displayBooking()\r\n    {       \r\n            cout &lt;&lt; booking_id &lt;&lt;&#39;\\t&#39;&lt;&lt;airline_id&lt;&lt;endl;       \r\n    }\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    char airline_id[3];\r\n\r\n} b1,b2;\r\n\r\nstring getNextBookingID(string ID);\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n    b1.addBooking();\r\n    b1.displayBooking();\r\n    return 0; \r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid calculateBookingID(char* id)\r\n{  \r\n        strcpy(id,&quot;B1001&quot;);\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some reason in the booking_id the airline_id is also getting added.

didn&#39;t understand your question completely but trying to address some of the concerns.\r\n\r\n&gt; You have a tensor of shape `[100, 1, 32, 32]` that represents 100 images of shape `[1, 32, 32]` where `num_channels = 1`, `width = 32`, `height = 32`. \r\n\r\nFirst, since the images have only one channel, we can squeeze the channel dimension.\r\n\r\n    # image_tensor is of shape [100, 1, 32, 32]\r\n    image_tensor = image_tensor.squeeze(1) # [100, 32, 32]\r\n\r\nWe can organize the resulting tensors into 10 rows of 10 images as you described.\r\n\r\n    image_tensor = image_tensor.reshape(10, 10, 32, 32)\r\n\r\nNow, converting the resulting tensor into a tensor of shape `[32*10, 32*10]` sounds something is wrong. But, let&#39;s do that wrong thing and see what we end up with.\r\n\r\n    image_tensor = image_tensor.permute(2, 0, 3, 1) # [32, 10, 32, 10]\r\n\r\nAfter permutation, we get a tensor of shape `[width, num_rows, height, num_img_in_a_row]`.

And it looks like,\r\n```python\r\ntensor([[[[ 0,  1],\r\n          [ 2,  3]]],\r\n        [[[ 4,  5],\r\n          [ 6,  7]]],\r\n        [[[ 8,  9],\r\n          [10, 11]]],\r\n        [[[12, 13],\r\n          [14, 15]]],\r\n        [[[16, 17],\r\n          [18, 19]]],\r\n        [[[20, 21],\r\n          [22, 23]]],\r\n        [[[24, 25],\r\n          [26, 27]]],\r\n        [[[28, 29],\r\n          [30, 31]]],\r\n        [[[32, 33],\r\n          [34, 35]]]])\r\n```\r\nEach 2x2 sub-matrix can be seen as one image. What you want to do is stacking the first three images to one row, next three images to the second row, and last three images to the third row.

How can I solve this problem fundamentally?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58362031/android-studio-build-error-duplicated-r-java-file","title":"Android Studio build error! duplicated R.java file"},{"tags":["java","stream","inputstream","bufferedreader"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58423,"user_id":53897,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e71c1745ebc5401c8c8dfbf7c9a5d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thorbj&#248;rn Ravn Andersen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/53897/thorbj%c3%b8rn-ravn-andersen"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570902212,"post_id":58356747,"comment_id":103066675,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356747/is-there-any-resource-leak-if-i-use-streaming-with-bufferedreader-in-java#comment103066675_58356747"},{"owner":{"reputation":11399,"user_id":1988876,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/810e652dfae6e519f042ce3db5a87a43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"brain storm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1988876/brain-storm"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":58423,"user_id":53897,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e71c1745ebc5401c8c8dfbf7c9a5d30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thorbj&#248;rn Ravn Andersen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/53897/thorbj%c3%b8rn-ravn-andersen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570902662,"post_id":58356747,"comment_id":103066791,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356747/is-there-any-resource-leak-if-i-use-streaming-with-bufferedreader-in-java#comment103066791_58356747"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11399,"user_id":1988876,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/810e652dfae6e519f042ce3db5a87a43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"brain storm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1988876/brain-storm"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570903929,"post_id":58356997,"comment_id":103067135,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356747/is-there-any-resource-leak-if-i-use-streaming-with-bufferedreader-in-java/58356997#comment103067135_58356997"},{"owner":{"reputation":54273,"user_id":1746118,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sx0Pe.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1746118/naman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11399,"user_id":1988876,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/810e652dfae6e519f042ce3db5a87a43?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"brain storm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1988876/brain-storm"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570904421,"post_id":58356997,"comment_id":103067271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356747/is-there-any-resource-leak-if-i-use-streaming-with-bufferedreader-in-java/58356997#comment103067271_58356997"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":54273,"user_id":1746118,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Sx0Pe.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1746118/naman"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570903406,"creation_date":1570903406,"answer_id":58356997,"question_id":58356747,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58356997","body_markdown":"No, the stream is not auto closed on performing the stream pipeline operation in such cases and in fact as stated in [the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html#lines--) there are also *no guarantees that the reader will be at a specific position from which to read the next character or line.*\r\n\r\nIn short `Stream`s ([tag:java-stream]) are not responsible for manipulating the stream ([tag:stream]) that has been passed on for processing as a resource.

correct syntax for connect is this:\r\n\r\n    QObject::connect( pushButton , SIGNAL (clicked()), this , SLOT(handleButton()));\r\n\r\nor the new function pointers syntax (in Qt5):\r\n\r\n    QObject::connect( pushButton , &amp;QPushButton::clicked, this , Ui_MainWindow::handleButton);\r\n\r\nBut you are doing something wrong there, you are not supposed to modify the class `UI_FormName`, because that file will most likely be regenerated when you modify your `.ui` file in Designer, check the documentation [here][1] on how you can use code generated by `uic` in your code.\r\n\r\nLE: Thank you @MathiasSchmid \r\nI didn&#39;t noticed that macro is missing, `Q_OBJECT` macro needs to be added in the private section of your class for signals and slots to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

am making a simple calculator app in C++ using Qt4 as the GUI framework.\r\nI have worked with Qt before but this time I am using C++ rather than python.\r\n\r\nNow I have three files in my project,\r\n\r\n - **main.cpp** *(Simple suite that calls and runs the main GUI class)*\r\n - **window.cpp** *(File Containing suite that implements the GUI class and other routines.)*\r\n - **header.h** *(Template for `window.cpp` file.)*\r\n\r\nThe main GUI implementing class is called **`Ui_MainWindow`**.\r\n\r\nNow, this class has a member function called `handleButton`\r\n\r\n&gt;What I want to do is call this `handlebutton` function when a `clicked` event happens.\r\nSo, what I should do is to connect the event to the slot (`handlebutton`) , right??\r\n\r\nThe name of the Button is `pushButton`, and as stated the `handlebutton` is a member function\r\nof the class `Ui_MainWindow`\r\n\r\nAnd here is the snippet which should  implement the later:\r\n&gt; `        QObject::connect( pushButton , SIGNAL (clicked()), this , handleButton );`\r\n\r\nSo,when this click event happens `this-&gt;handleButton` should be called, right??\r\n\r\nBut I am getting an error which is:\r\n\r\n    error: no matching function for call to ‘QObject::connect(QPushButton*&amp;, const char [11], Ui_MainWindow*, void (&amp;)())\r\n    QObject::connect( pushButton , SIGNAL (clicked()), this , handleButton );\r\n\r\n\r\nI tried making the member func static and tried all that i could think of but it doesn&#39;t seems to work for me.\r\n\r\n**Please

This solution is untested**\r\n\r\nI think you need to use dynamic SQL which will build your `SELECT` statement and create the `AS` alias on the fly (the `AS` alias defines the column header name)\r\n\r\nFirst, you need some reference tables (this assumes your database columns are always in English and will looked up against another language as neccesary)*\r\n\r\nLanguage\r\n\r\n    id| LanguageName\r\n    1 | English\r\n    2 | Francais\r\n    3 | Espanola\r\n\r\nAttribute\r\n\r\n    id|BaseName | Translation |LanguageId\r\n    1 |Book     | Livre       |2\r\n    2 |Book     | Libro       |3\r\n    3 |Author   | Auteur      |2\r\n    4 |Author   | Autora      |3\r\n    5 |Year     | Annee       |2\r\n    6 |Year     | Ano         |3\r\n\r\nThen the bones of your stored procedure is something like\r\n\r\n    SET @language:=&#39;French&#39;; # this will be a parameter in your stored procedure\r\n\r\n    SET @LangId = (SELECT id FROM Language WHERE LanguageName = @language) \r\n\r\n    # Get the translation for the columns in your query\r\n    SET @BookTranslation:=(SELECT Translation FROM Attribute WHERE BaseName = &#39;Book&#39; AND LanguageId = @LangId)\r\n    SET @AuthorTranslation:=(SELECT Translation FROM Attribute WHERE BaseName = &#39;Author&#39; AND LanguageId = @LangId)\r\n    SET @YearTranslation:=(SELECT Translation FROM Attribute WHERE BaseName = &#39;Year&#39; AND LanguageId = @LangId)\r\n\r\n\r\n    # build the statement\r\n    SET @sql:=&#39;SELECT &#39;\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;Book AS `&#39;)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,@BookTranslation)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;`,&#39;)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;Author AS `&#39;)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,@AuthorTranslation)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;`,&#39;)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;Year AS `&#39;)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,@YearTranslation)\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;` &#39;)\r\n\r\n    SET @sql:=CONCAT(@sql,&#39;FROM TABLE01&#39;\r\n\r\n    # Execute the statement\r\n    PREPARE dynamic_statement FROM @sql;\r\n    EXECUTE dynamic_statement;\r\n    DEALLOCATE PREPARE dynamic_statement;\r\n\r\n*You may also consider renaming the columns in your TABLE01 to ATTR1, ATTR2, ATTR3 and define the english attribute name in the Attirbute table, however this might make your database fairly difficult to work with\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356732/mysql-how-to-update-a-tables-headers-with-another-table-corresponding-rows/58359719#58359719","title":"MYSQL - How to update a

The logs are there, but how can I utilize them inside Stackdriver?\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://mehmandarov.com/slack-notifications-for-cloud-build/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/V58FY.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/u2fuc.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356708/monitor-and-alert-on-cloud-build-errors-with-stackdriver","title":"Monitor and Alert on Cloud Build errors with Stackdriver"},{"tags":["reactjs","typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570902006,"post_id":58356706,"comment_id":103066616,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356706/react-typescript-set-state-with-dynamic-key-names#comment103066616_58356706"},{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":5754587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/55CJS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Frank Egan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5754587/frank-egan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570903755,"post_id":58356706,"comment_id":103067083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356706/react-typescript-set-state-with-dynamic-key-names#comment103067083_58356706"},{"owner":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570903948,"post_id":58356706,"comment_id":103067145,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356706/react-typescript-set-state-with-dynamic-key-names#comment103067145_58356706"},{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":5754587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/55CJS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Frank Egan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5754587/frank-egan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570904222,"post_id":58356706,"comment_id":103067217,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356706/react-typescript-set-state-with-dynamic-key-names#comment103067217_58356706"},{"owner":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570904567,"post_id":58356706,"comment_id":103067309,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356706/react-typescript-set-state-with-dynamic-key-names#comment103067309_58356706"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":182,"user_id":7003817,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b651d5daa52cd9c4ad0caa2af2deca63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7003817/c-smith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570907027,"creation_date":1570907027,"answer_id":58357526,"question_id":58356706,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58357526","body_markdown":"I’d say it’s not possible for typescript to infer that the key you are using will always be a ‘keyof’ the type of your state, as you are concatenating two strings together - that it why it is showing [x: string] in the error message.

design, Delta doesn&#39;t immediately remove files to prevent active consumers from being impacted. It also provides the versioning (aka time-travel) so you can see history if necessary. To remove previous versions or uncommitted files you need to run [vacuum](https://docs.delta.io/latest/delta-utility.html#delta-vacuum).\r\n\r\n    import io.delta.tables._\r\n    \r\n    val deltaTable = DeltaTable.forPath(spark, pathToTable)\r\n    \r\n    deltaTable.vacuum() // use default retention period\r\n\r\nIn terms of your question on how to manage retention and compaction for bronze/silver/gold model, you should treat your landing table (aka bronze) as an append-only log. That means you don&#39;t need to perform compaction or any rewrites after the fact. The bronze table should be a record of the data you ingested from your upstream data source (e.g. Kafka) with minimal processing applied.\r\n\r\nThe bronze table is typically used as an incremental stream source to populate downstream datasets. Given that reading from Delta is done from the transaction log, small files is not such an issue compared to using the standard file readers that perform slow file listings.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still some some options to optimize the files as you write them to the bronze table: 1) compact your Kafka messages as you write out to Delta by first repartitioning to reduce the number of files, 2) increase your trigger interval so the ingest runs less frequently and is writing more messages to larger files.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356697/delta-lake-compacting-multiple-files-to-single-file/58443230#58443230","title":"Delta Lake Compacting Multiple files to single file"}],"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":4302676,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a9c84ea960a5638bc00deb08d8dd4495?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sarang Shinde","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4302676/sarang-shinde"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11415,"user_id":4420967,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J6pYX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"James Z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4420967/james-z"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58443230,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571496285,"creation_date":1570901267,"last_edit_date":1570907763,"question_id":58356697,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58356697","body_markdown":"I am currently exploring delta lake which is open sourced by databricks.

you only want to do the operation once, then there is possibly no way other than looping through all of the values. But, if you need to do this operation repeatedly and you want to improve time performance, I would suggest to do some pre-processing here. For example, you can generate the reverse map of this dictionary i.e something like.\r\n\r\n`reverse_dict = {v:k for (k,v) in dict}`\r\nHere, V can be an array of Ks like `{v1 : [k1,k5], v2 : [k3], v3....}`\r\n\r\nNow, you may create buckets based on say first letter from the above reverseMap. If the first letter is only english alpha-numeric, you will only have (26 + 10) buckets. If you can do with two letters, that would be 36 * 36 buckets. I am talking about something of a Trie data structure. Then, you may search on linearly inside the buckets. This can give you almost constant time performance with some extra memory use. If you have a really large amount of data that you cannot hold in modern RAM sizes, then you may have to distribute these buckets across various systems and use the same technique. This can drastically improve performance. Simply distributing linear search task across a cluster of machines can also work in that case, where each machine upon completion returns the result of keys [k1, k2... kn] and you finally club the results.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356680/how-to-check-the-existence-of-a-value-with-specific-pattern-in-the-dictionary/58357022#58357022","title":"How to check the existence of a value with specific pattern in the dictionary?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":12067560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YrPJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Corentin Pane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067560/corentin-pane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570919350,"post_id":58357211,"comment_id":103070644,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356680/how-to-check-the-existence-of-a-value-with-specific-pattern-in-the-dictionary/58357211#comment103070644_58357211"},{"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":10149318,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--zpevkWzm7c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA5o/7Dkw8RB-BpE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shervin Rad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10149318/shervin-rad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":12067560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YrPJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Corentin Pane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067560/corentin-pane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570920303,"post_id":58357211,"comment_id":103070817,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356680/how-to-check-the-existence-of-a-value-with-specific-pattern-in-the-dictionary/58357211#comment103070817_58357211"},{"owner":{"reputation":1259,"user_id":3286487,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p8iVP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"y.luis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3286487/y-luis"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570989975,"post_id":58357211,"comment_id":103083168,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356680/how-to-check-the-existence-of-a-value-with-specific-pattern-in-the-dictionary/58357211#comment103083168_58357211"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91,"user_id":10149318,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--zpevkWzm7c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA5o/7Dkw8RB-BpE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shervin Rad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10149318/shervin-rad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":91,"user_id":10149318,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--zpevkWzm7c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA5o/7Dkw8RB-BpE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Shervin Rad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10149318/shervin-rad"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570990250,"last_edit_date":1570990250,"creation_date":1570904850,"answer_id":58357211,"question_id":58356680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58357211","body_markdown":"    string = &quot;abcd&quot;\r\n    dic = {&#39;k1&#39; : &#39;abcd4545&#39;, &#39;k2&#39; : &#39;abab1234&#39;, &#39;k3&#39; : &#39;abcd789456&#39;}\r\n    \r\n    for key, val in dic.items():\r\n        if string == &quot;&quot;.join(list(val)[:len(string)]):\r\n            print(key)\r\n        else:\r\n            pass\r\n        \r\n\r\nIt looks through the first four letters in the dict values (does this by listing all the characters and joining only the first four).

Really I just want to make a scheme like here: https://rpsychologist.com/r-guide-longitudinal-lme-lmer. ![Example](https://rpsychologist.com/img/r-reference-lmer/3lvl.png)\r\n\r\nI can imagine how to do it in general, but how to put levels? In plantuml documentation there are many variants of diagrams (component, class, etc.), but which one is closer to experimental scheme?\r\n\r\nOr something like this (crossed and nested): ![Example2](https://wol-prod-cdn.literatumonline.com/cms/attachment/97e4fb66-117f-45ca-a79e-64553cce6506/mee312577-fig-0004-m.png)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a good idea to put some ellipses to discharge the plot.\r\n\r\nPlantuml is the choice because it can be implemented in R via https://github.com/rkrug/plantuml and can export images both to PNG (for html output) and LaTeX/PDF (for PDF output), I hope, directly from Rmarkdown rendering. But maybe it&#39;s breaking a butterfly on wheel and there are some easier instruments.\r\n\r\nMWE\r\n---\r\nUsing the `RatPupWeight` data from `nlme` package I can understand the structure by `str()` and some plots (not showing here). Rat pups (both sexes) from 27 litters have got some treatment affecting their weight. I can make a hierarchical table:\r\n\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(nlme)\r\nRats &lt;- as_tibble(RatPupWeight)\r\nRats %&gt;%\r\n  count(Treatment, Litter, sex) %&gt;%\r\n  kable() %&gt;% collapse_rows(columns = 1:2, valign = &quot;top&quot;)\r\n```\r\nHere is the piece of table:[![table][1]][1] (full one is very long).

The probability of your kind of scenario occurring is infinitesimally small. \r\n\r\nBut if it does happen, it is not necessarily a case of two transaction updating a row. It is a case of one transaction trying to update a row that is currently being updated. In any case the transaction currently updating the row obtains a lock on the row and any other transaction trying to update the same row is queued.\r\n\r\nAfter the first transaction completes the update, it releases the lock and the first among the *other* transactions in the queue obtains the lock to perform it&#39;s own update. This continues until the waiting queue is empty.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this facility is already built into most relational databases, so you needn&#39;t worry about two transactions updating the database at the same time.

However, you should just write the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid makeCityTile(hexTile map[32][32], int tile_count) {\r\n    int center=tile_count/2;\r\n    map[center][center].makeExists();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because in C and C++, when you pass an array to a function, it only passes a pointer to that array, it doesn&#39;t pass a copy of the whole array by value. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1461432/what-is-array-decaying for more details.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, it might be helpful to create a class to represent a map, and add member functions to manipulate that map. And while you are at it, C++ provides `std::vector&lt;&gt;` which is usually a much nicer way to store an array. Here&#39;s a quick example of how that might look:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Map {\r\n    const size_t count;\r\n    std::vector&lt;hexTile&gt; tiles;\r\n\r\n    public:\r\n    Map(size_t count): count(count), tiles(count * count) {\r\n        // put the initialization code from your main() here\r\n    }\r\n    hexTile &amp;at(size_t x, size_t y) {\r\n        return &amp;tiles[y * count + x];\r\n    }\r\n    void makeCityTile() {\r\n        at(count / 2, count / 2).makeExists();\r\n    }\r\n    ...\r\n};\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356640/passing-an-object-array-though-function-frustrations-c/58356678#58356678","title":"Passing an Object Array though Function Frustrations c++"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12154531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAa-GDT5m6josKAjEHO_pXKHFzqUbLVmA6ky9ob=k-s128","display_name":"Santana Scott","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154531/santana-scott"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58356678,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570955861,"creation_date":1570900875,"question_id":58356640,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58356640","body_markdown":"I am trying to take 2D array of objects of my custom class ```hexTile```, and pass them through a function, and using a member function on a specific part of the 2D array.

k, v =&gt; collection[v])));\r\nwell PostAsJson Async need FormUrlEndcodedContent as parameter and PostAsync need httpcontent as parameret. But it formurlendcoded content works perfectly with PostAsync, And why FormUrlEndcodedContent not running with PostAsJsonAsync?\r\n\r\nbut I can&#39;t convert that `MainImage` Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes cause I wont store it to my `api` as file (Actually I don&#39;t know if that method works or not to upload file).\r\n\r\nIs there any way to deal with this?

The code is already working and I put a list below with nine items explaining exactly what my problem is. Here is the link: https://codesandbox.io/s/question-about-hook-state-f3jtl\r\n\r\nI suspect useEffect could be the solution. I can&#39;t find out how to trigger it just when I click on &quot;Save&quot; to avoid performance issues. You might ask &quot;why are you updating the &quot;right&quot; state to have the effort of updating &quot;data.items&quot; just right after? Why not updating &quot;data.items&quot;. Well, Material-UI code are very bound and changing it seemed terrifying.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58356553/state-not-updating-when-save-is-clicked","title":"State not updating when &quot;Save&quot; is clicked"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8652}
