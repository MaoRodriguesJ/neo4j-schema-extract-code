No matter which of the two variants is used, with identical padding `mcrypt` and `openssl` results are identical!\r\n\r\nIt should be noted (see the hexadecimal output) that `mcrypt` doesn&#39;t remove the Zero-Padding during decryption (unlike `openssl` which removes the PKCS7-Padding during decryption). Also, Zero-Padding is [unreliable][2] compared to PKCS7-Padding. If the requirements allow it (which in your case is probably not the case because of the external provider), PKCS7-Padding should therefore be used.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, both posted variants use the same algorithm, namely [Triple-DES][6] in [CBC][7]-mode. Triple-DES has a blocksize of `8` bytes and a keysize of `24` bytes. Triple-DES is not identical to [DES][8], but is based on DES in the sense that it consists of three DES-runs (encryption-decryption-encryption = ede). `mcrypt` specifies Triple-DES/CBC with two parameters, `MCRYPT_3DES` (Triple-DES) and `MCRYPT_MODE_CBC` (CBC-mode), while `openssl` uses only one parameter, `DES-EDE3-CBC`.\r\n\r\nThere are several [Keying-Options][9] for Triple-DES. `3TDEA` uses three independent DES keys and is specified in the context of `openssl` with `DES-EDE3-CBC`, which expects a `24` bytes key, `2TDEA` uses two independent keys and can be specified in the context of `openssl` alternatively with `DES-EDE-CBC`, which expects a `16` bytes key.\r\n\r\nTriple-DES is much slower than the modern AES, but has a comparable security. As with padding, you should switch to AES if possible. \r\n\r\n[0]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-encrypt.php\r\n[1]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mcrypt-decrypt.php\r\n[2]:

This place (site, list, folder or whatever it&#39;s called) contains some images that I would like to be able to list and potentially download.\r\n\r\nDoing the following gives me the Name: &quot;Pictures&quot;, the Count: 393 and the ServerRelativeUrl: &quot;/sites/Pictures/Pictures&quot;.\r\n\r\n        using (ClientContext ctx = new ClientContext(site_url))\r\n        {\r\n            ctx.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(usr, secure_pwd);\r\n\r\n            Web web = ctx.Web;\r\n\r\n            List lst_pictures = web.Lists.GetByTitle(&quot;Pictures&quot;);\r\n\r\n            ctx.Load(lst_pictures.RootFolder);\r\n\r\n            ctx.ExecuteQuery();\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Name: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.Name);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;ItemCount: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.ItemCount);\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;ServerRelativeUrl: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.ServerRelativeUrl);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nFrom here on I have tried several things to list and loop through the files, but whatever I try, I keep getting the same exception saying that the collection hasn&#39;t been initialized and I can&#39;t seem to get it right.\r\n\r\nThen I have tried to see if I could somehow get help using both U2U CAM Query Builder and CAML Designer for SharePoint, but neither of these tools display the Pictures site (or list or folder) that I&#39;m looking for.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m thinking that this ought to be pretty straight forward for someone who is used to the not so intuitive way of querying SP for resources via CSOM.\r\n\r\nSo, can anyone guide me as to what I do from here, so get the files listed in a way so that they can be downloaded (the link to the file should do in that regard).\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated, thanks.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 1**\r\n\r\nI added the lines you suggested and I&#39;m pretty sure that I have already had those lines in my code during previous tests, but I removed them again because it didn&#39;t work out for me - and it still doesn&#39;t :(\r\nSee the image here.\r\n\r\n    // lines not shown in the image\r\n    ctx.Load(lst_pictures.RootFolder);\r\n    ctx.Load(lst_pictures.RootFolder.Files);\r\n    \r\n    ctx.ExecuteQuery();\r\n                    \r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Name: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.Name);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;ItemCount: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.ItemCount);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;ServerRelativeUrl: &quot; + lst_pictures.RootFolder.ServerRelativeUrl):\r\n    \r\n    FileCollection files = lst_pictures.RootFolder.Files;\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first part works though, but it did that before changing the code.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 2**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 3**\r\nUpdated code according to comments, still no go though.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE 4: the solution**\r\n\r\nWell it turns out that the actual problem was the nuget package installed called *Microsoft.SharePoint.Client* v.14.xxxx. It should have been the one just called *SharePoint.Client* v.15.xxxx (this one has no description but comes from Microsoft).\r\n\r\nSo, thanks to Adam for trying to help me, I will mark your answer as correct since it finally led me to the problem so it could be fixed.\r\nInstalling the correct package fixed the issue right away.\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\n\r\nCorrect

want to make bean dependant on another bean, but without the need of re-defining it once again, as I have it already from the Spring Boot autoconfiguration.\r\n\r\nI am setting a Liquibase in the existing Spring Boot project. The project has also Hibernate configured, and it uses the following configuration:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=validate\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Hibernate validation is performed before the Liquibase migration and crashes the application because Hibernate can not detect tables, which are going to be created by Liquibase. Also, I do not want to turn this validation off.\r\n\r\nFrom the multiple SO answers and blog posts I know that all I need to do is to postpone the creation of the ```entityManagerFactory``` bean and make it dependant on the creation of the Liquibase bean using the ```@DependsOn``` annotation, but the issue is, that I do not want to repeat the work that Spring Boot Autoconfiguration is already doing.\r\n\r\nThis is the suggested approach, but not satisfying for me:\r\n\r\n```java\r\n    @Bean\r\n    public SpringLiquibase liquibase(DataSource dataSource) {\r\n        SpringLiquibase liquibase = new SpringLiquibase();\r\n        liquibase.setChangeLog(&quot;classpath:liquibase-changelog.xml&quot;);\r\n        liquibase.setDataSource(dataSource);\r\n        return liquibase;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Bean\r\n    @DependsOn(&quot;liquibase&quot;)\r\n    // I get this LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean configured from Spring Boot Autoconfiguration, \r\n    // so I see no point of configuring it once again\r\n    public LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean entityManagerFactory(Properties hibernateProperties,\r\n                                                                       DataSource dataSource) {\r\n        LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean bean = new LocalContainerEntityManagerFactoryBean();\r\n        bean.setDataSource(dataSource);\r\n        bean.setPersistenceProviderClass(HibernatePersistenceProvider.class);\r\n        bean.setPackagesToScan(&quot;com.package&quot;);\r\n        bean.setJpaProperties(hibernateProperties);\r\n        return bean;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this any way to avoid overriding the ```entityManagerFactory``` bean and having it dependent on the creation of the Liquibase bean?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234652/how-to-make-hibernates-entitymanagerfactory-be-created-after-liquibase-bean-wi","title":"How to make Hibernate&#39;s EntityManagerFactory be created after Liquibase bean, without overriding the Spring-Boot&#39;s EntityManagerFactory bean?"},{"tags":["crystal-reports"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4590,"user_id":2024469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4KVD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ajay2707","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2024469/ajay2707"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570194606,"post_id":58234649,"comment_id":102847002,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234649/different-performance-in-different-windows-user-profile-on-previewing-a-report-w#comment102847002_58234649"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":8805935,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_zY1RhEqn9Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASo/jqLXUJ4F6dM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Riccardo Spinato","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805935/riccardo-spinato"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4590,"user_id":2024469,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F4KVD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ajay2707","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2024469/ajay2707"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570195616,"post_id":58234649,"comment_id":102847531,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234649/different-performance-in-different-windows-user-profile-on-previewing-a-report-w#comment102847531_58234649"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":8805935,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_zY1RhEqn9Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASo/jqLXUJ4F6dM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Riccardo Spinato","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8805935/riccardo-spinato"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571145518,"post_id":58244810,"comment_id":103136876,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234649/different-performance-in-different-windows-user-profile-on-previewing-a-report-w/58244810#comment103136876_58244810"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":890,"user_id":1734722,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qcSQ4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MilletSoftware","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1734722/milletsoftware"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570241286,"creation_date":1570241286,"answer_id":58244810,"question_id":58234649,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58244810","body_markdown":"This might be due to the rpt using a specified printer.

Why this happens?\r\n\r\nThis error is occurring because you are inserting a new column without default value and without `NULLABLE` to your table that already has rows.\r\n\r\nWhen you do it, MySQL will set it value to `0`, so all your tables will have `standard_id` and `section_id` set to `0`, so when you try to add your foreign index, it fails because `0` is not a valid id on your `standards`/`sections` table.\r\n\r\n# So how to fix?\r\n\r\nYou have some ways to solve this issue:\r\n\r\n## 1st: Setting a default value\r\n\r\nIf make sense for your application, you can set a default (valid) value to your column, so the foreign key won&#39;t fail:\r\n\r\n            $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;standard_id&#39;)-&gt;default(1)-&gt;after(&#39;roll_number&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;section_id&#39;)-&gt;default(1)-&gt;after(&#39;standard_id&#39;);\r\n\r\nMost times it&#39;s not so simple, so you will need to define the value dinamically\r\n\r\n# 2nd: Setting the value dynamically\r\n\r\nIf you have some logic to set the default value for this new columns, you can break you migration into two steps:\r\n\r\n    // Add the fields first\r\n    Schema::table(&#39;students&#39;, function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n            $table-&gt;dropUnique([&#39;roll_number&#39;, &#39;section&#39;, &#39;class&#39;,

--webroot=&quot;C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Jenkins\\war&quot;] finished with 1\r\n\r\nI have checked which process is using port 8080 using netstat, but can&#39;t find anything.\r\nI know I can change the port when starting Jenkins using the &quot;httpPort&quot;-flag. Doing so (e.g. changing the port to 8081) will work - until I restart Jenkins again, this time 8081 will be in use (and also 8080 and all other ports I&#39;ve been using before). This can only be resolved by restarting the server, then 8080 (and all other ports) will be available again.\r\n\r\nBoth &quot;solutions&quot; (1. keep changing the port, 2. restarting the server) are just tedious workarounds for me as I have to inform all colleagues which port is currently in use all the time or let administration restart the server over and over again.\r\nThe flag &quot;--ajp13Port=-1&quot; is an attempt to get this fixed, I also tried disabling the &quot;RunawayProcessKiller&quot;-extension as suggested in another post, but both didn&#39;t change anything.\r\n\r\nAny hint to get this fixed is much appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234518/cannot-restart-jenkins-on-windows-server-2012-port-in-use","title":"Cannot

Critically, there are &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; tables on the page at the same time, as opposed to other answers where it&#39;s just 1 table where the column names change based on the data in the ajax response.\r\n\r\nPreviously I&#39;ve used it where the `&lt;table&gt;` HTML is present on page load and contains the column headings, e.g.\r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;table1&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt; \r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 1 - Column A&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 1 - Column B&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 1 - Column C&lt;/th&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;table2&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;tr&gt; \r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 2 - Column A&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 2 - Column B&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;th&gt;Table 2 - Column C&lt;/th&gt;\r\n            &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this scenario there are 2 tables with ID&#39;s `#table1` and `#table2`. I initialized them as follows:\r\n\r\n    $.each($(&#39;table&#39;), function () {\r\n        drawTable($(this).attr(&#39;id&#39;));\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis takes the ID for each table and calls a custom function I wrote called `drawTable()` and passes the ID as an argument. The `drawTable()` function then initiaizes the DataTable on that element, and handles the ajax request/response, e.g.\r\n\r\n    function drawTable(id) {\r\n            $id = $(&#39;#&#39;+id); // Convert string ID to jQuery identifier\r\n            \r\n            $id.DataTable({\r\n                processing: true,\r\n                serverSide: true,\r\n                searching: false,\r\n                ajax: {\r\n                    data: {\r\n                       table_id: id, // So we know which table ID to obtain data for\r\n                       // ...\r\n                    },\r\n                    url: &#39;/get-data.json&#39;, \r\n                },\r\n                columns: [\r\n                  { &quot;data&quot;: &quot;columnA&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;columnA&quot; },\r\n                  { &quot;data&quot;: &quot;columnB&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;columnB&quot; },\r\n                  { &quot;data&quot;: &quot;columnC&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;columnC&quot; },\r\n                ],\r\n                // ...\r\n            });\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThis works because in the above example both tables have the same columns in them.\r\n\r\nI now have a scenario where one table contains 5 columns and the other 3. The names (as in the text that will appear in the `&lt;th&gt;` elements) are completely different in both cases.\r\n\r\nHow can I handle this? My thought was that I&#39;d have to make a request to an ajax endpoint to produce an array - defined in `columns:` in the js above. Or to hardcode the array into my js for each table and then somehow determine which array to use based on the ID of the table. \r\n\r\nHowever I&#39;m unsure if this is the right approach or how people have handled this before?\r\n\r\nDataTables version is 1.10.18 and jQuery 3.2.1\r\n\r\nI had a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36046139/datatables-dynamic-columns-from-ajax-data-source but this seems different to what I&#39;m doing. Because on this example they have &lt;b&gt;one table&lt;/b&gt; (with an ID `#example`) and are then rendering column names based on an ajax response. In my application &lt;b&gt;multiple tables&lt;/b&gt; are visible at the same time, and they all have different column names. \r\n\r\nThe other avenue I considered was to get rid of the `$.each` code and simply have a separate function per table. But this seems very against [DRY][1] because I&#39;d be repeating a lot of the same properties, when it&#39;s really just `columns:` that needs to change per table - as far as I can see?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234478/datatables-set-column-names-dynamically-from-an-ajax-request-with-multiple-tab","title":"DataTables - set column names dynamically from an ajax request with multiple tables per page"},{"tags":["postgresql","hadoop","cassandra","bigdata","greenplum"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570184947,"post_id":58234476,"comment_id":102842405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234476/manage-almost-3-5-pb-3500-tb-of-data#comment102842405_58234476"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":5635791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hsYscNPQlgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAH7M/kn44oS_LxV0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sung Yu-wei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5635791/sung-yu-wei"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570221470,"post_id":58238874,"comment_id":102858045,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234476/manage-almost-3-5-pb-3500-tb-of-data/58238874#comment102858045_58238874"},{"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":5635791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-hsYscNPQlgg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAH7M/kn44oS_LxV0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sung Yu-wei","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5635791/sung-yu-wei"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570221727,"post_id":58238874,"comment_id":102858128,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234476/manage-almost-3-5-pb-3500-tb-of-data/58238874#comment102858128_58238874"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1623,"user_id":5368565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g6ZqA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jon Roberts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5368565/jon-roberts"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570201180,"creation_date":1570201180,"answer_id":58238874,"question_id":58234476,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58238874","body_markdown":"You likely won&#39;t need indexes because of the architecture of Greenplum.  You will just need to use good partitioning which your design suggests.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the cluster for data transformation is also a great idea and a common use case for Greenplum.\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\nWhat I have udnerstood so far is that GreenPlum recommends 2x8 cores(Threads) and 256 GB RAM per host.\r\n\r\nBy &quot;threads&quot;, I&#39;m assuming you mean &quot;Segments&quot; and your statement isn&#39;t completely accurate.  The number of Segments per host depends on how much RAM, cores, and disk performance each Segment host will have in addition to the level of concurrency.  \r\n\r\nI would use a minimum of 8GB of RAM, 4 cores, and 100 MB/s of disk performance per segment.  And 100 MB/s of disk performance is definitely on the low end.  It will be a balancing act of getting the number of segments per host right.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this is with the TPC-DS benchmark.  https://github.com/pivotalguru/tpc-ds\r\nYou can run the benchmark, get the results, reinitialize the cluster to use more/less segments per host, and then run the test again.  You can also set the level of concurrency in the test that best matches what you are expecting.\r\n\r\n&gt; \r\nAlso I wanted to know if it is ok to not give dedicated disks to the server and rather use a single SAN storage. Each server can have 2x10G links to make sure easy data transfers between nodes and SAN.\r\n\r\nSAN is usually configured with IOPs in mind and not throughput which Greenplum needs.  With that much data, you are usually better off with DAS.  Some cloud vendors provide pretty good throughput to their SAN solutions but you end up having to run many, small nodes to get the overall throughput you want.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234476/manage-almost-3-5-pb-3500-tb-of-data/58238874#58238874","title":"Manage almost 3.5 PB/3500 TB of data"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12163895,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/--sSMqGRDTrg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfY1_GmCb7TDKifNrwKMkA01l6tIA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sandeep Chhokar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12163895/sandeep-chhokar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1570206159,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570201180,"creation_date":1570184432,"question_id":58234476,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58234476","body_markdown":"I am looking at an opportunity wherein we will have to manage almost 3.5 PB/3500 TB of data. From what I have read so far, GreenPlum seems to be a good choice. Having said that I am struggling to find a good resource to give me an idea around the Hardware requirements. Following are the base inputs on which we are building this:\r\n \r\n1). Data would be coming in at rate of 2 GBps (Giga BYTE)\r\n2). The data is fairly simple with only one large table with 15 odd columns. Each column/record would be close to 2 KB\r\n3). I would need indexing on 6 columns. Each of these columns is a varchar/string column \r\n4). The use case is more write intensive and less of read intensive. The idea would be to process a set of 15-20 batch jobs per day. Real/Near real time analytics is not a necessity. This is more from a reporting purpose.\r\n5). Data is time series data and would be required for a month. So data older than a month would be purged.\r\n \r\nWhat I have udnerstood so far is that GreenPlum recommends 2x8 cores(Threads) and 256 GB RAM per host. Also each host should typically looks at 24 slots of hard disk. If I look at ESAS with 4TB each I should be able to host 96 TB / host.If I assume a simple linear extrapolation I would be looking at (3500 / 96 ) 37 nodes. \r\n \r\nNow I know its not that simple/linear a calculation. Hence, I wanted to udnerstand if there is any calculator/resource/guidelines to size the database cluster. Also I wanted to know if it is ok to not give dedicated disks to the server and rather use a single SAN storage. Each server can have 2x10G links to make sure easy data transfers between nodes and SAN.\r\n \r\nMany Thanks.\r\n

It is inside of a `NavigationController` with a hidden `navigationBar`. The `CollectionViewCells` have the height of the screen too.  \r\n  \r\nWhat I would expect to happen:  \r\nEach cell fills the whole screen and when I swipe to left/right another cell appears and fills the whole screen.  \r\n  \r\nWhat actually happens:  \r\nThe cells are not filling the whole screen. There is a little space (approx. 20 pxl) between the top of the cells and the top border of the screen. Also the bottom of the cell (also approx. 20 pxl) is &quot;under&quot; the bottom border of the screen.  \r\nAlso i get a warning:  \r\n&gt; The behavior of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout is not defined because:  \r\nthe item height must be less than the height of the UICollectionView minus the section insets top and bottom values, minus the content insets top and bottom values.\r\n  \r\nSo the cells height is correct as it seems, but the y-value is wrong.  \r\n  \r\nWhat I already tried:\r\n`override shouldInvalidateLayoutForBoundsChange` to return true.  \r\n  \r\nAs you can see [here](https://i.ibb.co/kKPJcXK/Bildschirmfoto-2019-10-04-um-11-59-37.png) the blue border is the border of the collectionView and the red border is the border of the cell.

Hence:\r\n\r\n    git branch master network/master\r\n    git read-tree master\r\n\r\nis probably sufficient.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet me turn my comments above into an actual answer now that I have a bit of time to spare.  We&#39;ve noted that `--separate-git-dir` doesn&#39;t make the repository *bare*—a bare repository is one with *no* work-tree—it just puts the work-tree and repository (`.git/*` files) in two different locations in the file system.  To make this function, Git adds a `.git` *file* in the work-tree, containing the path name of the repository itself, as you noted.\r\n\r\nSo, in this case, that repository itself has been damaged or destroyed.  You have a work-tree with no repository.  You&#39;ve created a new, empty repository using another `git init --separate-git-dir=...` and run the commands:\r\n\r\n&gt;     git remote add network ssh://host/path/to/repo\r\n\r\n(I would probably have named the remote `origin` rather than `network` but there&#39;s nothing *wrong* with `network`, it&#39;s just a bit unconventional.)\r\n\r\nWhat you needed to do next is populate the repository itself with commits, and you did that:\r\n\r\n&gt;     git fetch network\r\n\r\nYour repository itself (in whichever directory) now has some set of commits, copied from the Git repository at the URL at which you ran `git fetch`.\r\n\r\nAt this point *almost* everything is normal.  Two things are missing:\r\n\r\n * There are no local branches, in spite of the *current* branch being the one named `master`.  The branch `master` doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\n * The index—the collection of files that would go into the *next* commit you would make—is empty.\r\n\r\nIf you were to make a commit now, that would create a commit with no parent commit, and with no content (the [empty tree](https://stackoverflow.com/q/9765453/1256452)), and create the branch `master` in the process, but that&#39;s pretty clearly *not* what you want.  Instead, you probably want:\r\n\r\n 1. To create the local name `master` to match the remote-tracking name `origin/master` that points to the final commit of the branch `master` in the `network` repository from which you copied all its commits.  To do that, use:\r\n\r\n        git branch master network/master\r\n\r\n You can use anything you like as the final argument, as long as it names any actual commit: a raw hash ID will suffice, or something like `network/master^`, or `network/master~3`, or whatever.  If you *do* use the name `network/master`, Git recognizes that this is a *remote-tracking name*.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  As a consequence, `git branch` sets this remote-tracking name as the *upstream* of the new (local) branch name `master`.\r\n\r\n More precisely, the automatic upstream setting is the *default* action for `git branch` here (and for some forms of `git checkout` as well).  You can configure Git to change the default, or you can add command line flags to override whatever default you have or have not set.\r\n\r\n To *prevent* this upstream-setting, use `git branch --no-track master network/master`.  To *force* the upstream-setting, use `git branch --track master network/master`, which you can abbreviate as `git branch --track network/master`.\r\n\r\n Whether and when to set the upstream setting is up to you.  You can always change it later using `git branch --set-upstream`, or remove it later using `git branch --unset-upstream`.\r\n\r\n 2. Now that `master` exists—or you can do this before creating `master`, but I&#39;d do it afterward as it just feels simpler and easier to get right—you will want to populate your index from the commit you&#39;ve selected as your current commit.  Normally—in a situation other than this &quot;repair broken Git repository&quot; case—we&#39;d do steps 1 and 2 all together at once using `git checkout`, but you want to do this *without* disturbing the current work-tree, and `git checkout` disturbs the current work-tree.  So we do this as a separate step 2, using one of Git&#39;s lower level *plumbing* commands:&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n        git read-tree master\r\n\r\n (or `git read-tree HEAD` or `git read-tree @` if you want to type less: all three do the same thing).  This simply reads the named commit into the index, without doing anything else at all: it replaces whatever was in the index (which was nothing) with whatever is in the named commit.\r\n\r\nAfter doing the `git branch` and `git read-tree`, `git status` will be able to compare the current commit—the one named by `HEAD` / `master`—with the current index contents—they will match of course—and then compare the current index contents with the current work-tree contents.  These will match or differ based on which commit you chose when setting up your own `master` in step 1, and in any case you&#39;ll be ready to `git add` and make new commits if you like.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;A *remote-tracking name* is any name whose full spelling starts with `refs/remotes/`.  In this case `network/master` is really `refs/remotes/network/master`.  Git documentation mostly calls these *remote-tracking branch names* but the word &quot;branch&quot; here is, I think, more misleading than not, so I omit it.\r\n\r\nThese names exist in *your* Git repository and are automatically created and updated based on the branch names that your Git gets from the other Git—the one at the URL stored under the name `network`—whenever your Git does a `git fetch` from the Git at `network`.  A successful `git push network` also updates any branches that they set based on your Git&#39;s requests.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;The distinction between *plumbing* and *porcelain* in Git is really in terms of who is meant to use a command: a porcelain command is meant to be user-friendly and goal-oriented,&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and a plumbing command is meant to be a command that a porcelain command might use as one of a series of such commands (and/or in combination with other system utilities) in order to accomplish some actual goal.  Thus, plumbing commands tend to be extra-specific and mechanism-oriented (`git read-tree`, &quot;fill index from commit&quot;; `git rev-parse`, &quot;turn human-readable name into internal hash ID&quot;; `git update-ref`, &quot;write raw hash ID into arbitrary reference&quot;).\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Or perhaps &quot;less actively user-hostile&quot;. :-) See also https://git-man-page-generator.lokaltog.net/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234462/how-to-restore-a-locally-lost-git-bare-repo-using-separate-git-dir-with-one-of/58259804#58259804","title":"How to restore a locally lost git bare repo (using separate-git-dir) with one of its remotes"}],"owner":{"reputation":240,"user_id":690455,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/68673e68d63f602a249976c9d100135b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jaydisc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/690455/jaydisc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":859,"user_id":2482441,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e5d385aebfa56f6bcc92ddd7a8ace23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hugo y","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2482441/hugo-y"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58259804,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570383866,"creation_date":1570184375,"last_edit_date":1570375540,"question_id":58234462,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58234462","body_markdown":"A long time ago, I set up a repo using git --separate-git-dir because I did want the repo inside the working directory.

Since you already have a action to GET_TODOS, just make the action creator for `runningTimer` to do one and only one thing - make API call to `/api/v1/beta/&lt;userId&gt;` and dispatch respective actions.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport const runningTimer = (\r\n  userId,\r\n  query,\r\n  statusTask,\r\n  pageNumber\r\n) =&gt; dispatch =&gt; {\r\n  return axios({\r\n    url: `/api/v1/beta/${userId}`,\r\n    method: &quot;GET&quot;\r\n  })\r\n    .then(({ data }) =&gt; {\r\n      dispatch({\r\n        type: RUNNING_TIMER,\r\n        payload: data\r\n      });\r\n    })\r\n    .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(error);\r\n\r\n      dispatch({ type: FETCH_FAILURE });\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. Update props of your app component to read store data.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n...\r\nconst mapStateToProps = state =&gt; {\r\n  const { isRunningTimer, todos, todo } = state;\r\n\r\n  return {\r\n    todos,\r\n    todo,\r\n    isRunningTimer,\r\n  };\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =&gt; ({\r\n  getTodos: () =&gt; dispatch(getTodos()),\r\n  getTodo: id =&gt; dispatch(getTodo(id)),\r\n  runningTimer: (userId, query, statusTask, pageNumber) =&gt; dispatch(runningTimer(userId)),\r\n});\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n 3. Update the implementation of `componentDidMount` to dispatch `isRunningTimer` -\r\n\r\n```js\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n...\r\n    // call with userId 1\r\n    this.props.runningTimer(1).then(() =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(this.props);\r\n\r\n          // additional params for getTasks\r\n      const params = {\r\n        sort: &#39;name&#39;\r\n      };\r\n\r\n      // another call for getTodos with names sorted\r\n      this.props.getTodos(params);\r\n    });\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: You need to update your `getTodos` action to take in an optional `params` arguments (which is initialized to empty object if not passed).\r\n\r\nHope this helps you.\r\n\r\nLive sandbox for this is present here - https://stackblitz.com/edit/react-redux-more-actions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234442/converting-functions-from-pure-react-to-redux-react/58308603#58308603","title":"Converting functions from pure react to redux react"}],"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":9974904,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d183b6c27e1754f42d2457dc787580e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Umbro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9974904/umbro"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":282,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58260897,"answer_count":3,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570639847,"creation_date":1570184295,"question_id":58234442,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58234442","body_markdown":"In pure react, I have written a function that I call in `componentDidMount ()`:\r\n\r\n      getTasks = (userId, query, statusTask, pageNumber) =&gt; {\r\n        let check = {};\r\n        axios({\r\n          url: `/api/v1/beta/${userId}`,\r\n          method: &#39;GET&#39;\r\n        })\r\n          .then(res =&gt; {\r\n            check = res.data;\r\n    \r\n            if (res.data) {\r\n              this.setState({\r\n                checkRunning: res.data,\r\n                checkRunningId: res.data.id\r\n              });\r\n              this.utilizeTimes(res.data.task_id);\r\n            }\r\n          })\r\n          .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(error);\r\n          })\r\n          .then(() =&gt; {\r\n            const params = {\r\n              sort: &#39;name&#39;\r\n            };\r\n    \r\n            if (query) {\r\n              params[&#39;filter[qwp]&#39;] = query;\r\n              if (this.state.tasks[0]) {\r\n                this.setState({\r\n                  selectedId: this.state.tasks[0].id,\r\n                  selectedTabId: this.state.tasks[0].id\r\n                });\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            axios({\r\n              url: &#39;/api/v1//tasks&#39;,\r\n              method: &#39;GET&#39;,\r\n              params\r\n            })\r\n              .then(res =&gt; {\r\n                if (res.status === 200 &amp;&amp; res.data) {\r\n                  this.setState({\r\n                    tasks: res.data,\r\n                    lengthArrayTasks: parseInt(res.headers[&#39;x-pagination-total-count&#39;])\r\n                  });\r\n    \r\n                  if (!check &amp;&amp; res.data &amp;&amp; res.data[0]) {\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                      selectedTabId: res.data[0].id,\r\n                    });\r\n    \r\n                    this.load(res.data[0].id);\r\n                  }\r\n    \r\n                  let myArrayTasks = [];\r\n                  myArrayTasks = res.data;\r\n                  let findObject = myArrayTasks.find(task =&gt; task.id === this.state.runningTimerTask.id);\r\n    \r\n                  if (\r\n                    !findObject &amp;&amp;\r\n                    this.state.runningTimerTask &amp;&amp;\r\n                    this.state.runningTimerTask.id &amp;&amp;\r\n                    this.state.query === &#39;&#39;\r\n                  ) {\r\n                    this.setState({\r\n                      tasks: [this.state.runningTimerTask, ...myArrayTasks]\r\n                    });\r\n                  }\r\n                }\r\n              })\r\n              .catch(error =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(error);\r\n              });\r\n          });\r\n      };\r\n\r\nI am trying to rewrite it to redux, but with poor results.

am looking for the options to host existing ASP.NET Framework (**not** .NET Core, and **not** ASP.NET Core) applications in ServiceFabric hosted on-premise.\r\n\r\nWe host such legacy applications in IIS, as is the common practice I believe, and we are considering migrating them to an on-prem ServiceFabric cluster without (or at least, as little as possible) modifications.\r\n\r\nI see that Visual Studio 2017 SF project templates do not have the &quot;old ASP.NET&quot;, which makes me think that using old ASP.NET isn&#39;t preferred, if supported at all. I can understand that.\r\n\r\nI understand that it is possible to deploy the application in a container with IIS, e.g. [with Windows IIS](https://hub.docker.com/_/microsoft-windows-servercore-iis).\r\n\r\nAre there other possibilities?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58234420/hosting-legacy-asp-net-not-asp-net-core-in-servicefabric","title":"Hosting legacy ASP.NET (not ASP.NET Core) in ServiceFabric"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8140}
