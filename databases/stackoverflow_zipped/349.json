I assume that the call is O(n) and that there is no magic taking place behind the scenes to optimize the call. So, in the attempt to speed things up, I used this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDerivedResource resource = dbSet.Find(guid);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is quick, but results in `resource` missing some data: the `Data` property is `null`. How can I either fill in this data, or otherwise quickly retrieve an item by key?\r\n\r\nFollowing is a sketch of the classes I&#39;m using. I suspect that the fact that `DerivedResource : BaseResource` doesn&#39;t matter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[Table(&quot;DerivedResource&quot;)]\r\npublic class DerivedResource : BaseResource&lt;DerivedResource&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public BaseData Data { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Table(&quot;DerivedResource_BaseData&quot;)]\r\npublic abstract class BaseData\r\n{\r\n    [JsonIgnore]\r\n    [Required]\r\n    [ForeignKey(&quot;DerivedResourceGuid&quot;)]\r\n    public DerivedResource DerivedResource { get; private set; }\r\n\r\n    [JsonIgnore]\r\n    [Key]\r\n    [Required, Column(&quot;DerivedResourceID&quot;)]\r\n    public Guid DerivedResourceGuid { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Table(&quot;DerivedResource_BaseData_DerivedData&quot;)]\r\npublic class DerivedData : BaseData { }\r\n\r\npublic abstract class BaseResource&lt;T&gt;\r\n{\r\n    [Key]\r\n    [Column(&quot;ID&quot;)]\r\n    [DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.Identity)]\r\n    public Guid Guid { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public virtual void DoSomething&lt;T&gt;(T t) { }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am new to Entity and would really appreciate the help.

on the actions\r\n   you want to be made (Like Update, Create, etc.)\r\n - Can be run &quot;onDemand&quot;\r\n - Can often be handled by KeyUsers and do not need an explicit developer\r\n - Should not be used for complicated logic as the iterface often does not provide the possibility to add additional logic afterwards\r\n - If used for complicated logic (as statened above), refaktoring or changes are often very hard to integrate!\r\n - In current Cloud organisations you get the Information that you SHOULD not use these anymore, but to swith to MS Flow. (VERY IMPORTANT!!)\r\n\r\nPlugins:\r\n\r\n - Custom Code - so you can provide very complicated or also simple server-side logic\r\n - You need a(n experienced) developer\r\n - Can perform faster than workflows!\r\n - nearly everything you can do with a Workflow can be done by a Plugin (or job) but not visa-vera\r\n - You have the possibility to trigger the plugin as well as hand in Data (Parameters!) as you can create your own &quot;Messages&quot; (With this i mean you do not only use Update, Delete and Create, etc. as Messages for Plugins, but you can define your own Message Steps by creating &quot;Actions&quot; in the Prozess Section in your Dynamics Organization. There you can define Input- AND Outputparameters. These custom Messages can be also triggered on demand!!! For instance by using javascript. [Guid how to use/create custom Messages (Actions)][2])\r\n\r\nIn my experience Plugins are mostly the better suited solution if you have (even a little) complicated matter, as workflows are far less maintainable. Simple &quot;1 Liners&quot; can often be replaced by workflows.\r\nNevertheless each developer/consultant has to suggest his own way for the improvement/developmet of his/her organization.\r\n\r\n@Community: Feel free to correct me, if i am wrong anywhere or if you have different experiences.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The text boxes on the form are connected to the DB fields. I would like two of the textboxes on the form to be password protected and make encrypt/decrypt the DB fields they are linked to in the process.\r\n\r\n***Ex:***\r\n\r\nWhen the form opens, the two text boxes have the input mask &quot;password&quot; and the two DB fields are encrypted (let&#39;s call this the &quot;locked&quot; state). But, if you press their respective button, a prompt opens and asks for a password. If the password entered does not match the expected value, the prompt reopens with a warning that the password entered is incorrect and asks to retry, however, once that password is correctly entered, the dialog is closed, the DB fields are decrypted and the input masks on the text boxes are cleared until the form is closed again (let&#39;s call this the unlocked state). Once the form is closed again, the text boxes and DB fields should be put back to the way they were before (in a &quot;locked&quot; state).\r\n\r\n***P.S.***\r\n\r\n 1. When the fields are &quot;unlocked&quot; they should be visible and modifiable but only until the form is closed.\r\n 2. If the fields could automatically be &quot;locked&quot; after 5 minutes of inactivity that would be fantastic\r\n 3. The Form itself already requires the SQL credentials to be opened, but the two fields in question here just need a bit more protection as so only a few people can access and modify them and as to prevent accidental modifications\r\n 4.

From the least likely to the most likely.\r\n\r\n## The glitching output\r\n\r\nIt is all in the eye of the beholder, as how the program output will look like depends on the environment in which it is run, i.e., on a program that runs your program and renders this on a visual device. In other words, it involves a lot of variables that are beyond the context of this program.\r\n\r\nWith that said, let me explain what flush means for the `printf` function. The `printf` facility relies on buffered channels. And each channel is roughly a pair of a buffer and system-specific file descriptor. When someone (including `printf`) outputs to a channel, the information first goes into the buffer and remains there until the next portion of information overrides the buffer (i.e., there is no more space in the buffer) or until the flush function is called explicitly. Then the buffer is flushed, which means that the information in the buffer is transferred to the operating system (e.g., using the `write` system call or library function). \r\n\r\nWhat happens afterward is system dependent. If the file descriptor was associated with a regular file, then you might expect that the information will be passed to it entirely(though the file system has its own hierarchy of caches, so there&#39;re caveats also). If the descriptor was associated with a Unix-style shell process through a pipe, then it will go into the pipe&#39;s buffer, extracted from it by the shell and printed using a terminal interface, usually fulfilled with some terminal emulator. By default shells are line-buffered, so the line should be printed as a whole unless the user of the shell changes its parameters somehow. \r\n\r\nBasically, I hope you get the idea, it is not your program which is actually manipulating with the terminal and lighting up pixels on your monitors. Your program is just outputting data and some other program is receiving this data and drawing it on the screen. And this some other program (a terminal, or terminal emulator, e.g., minicom) is making this output glitchy, not your program. Your program is doing its best to be printed correctly - full line or nothing. \r\n\r\n## Your program is glitching\r\n\r\nAnd it is. The in_channel is also buffered, so it will accumulate a few bytes before calling sprintf. Therefore, you can just read from the buffered channel and expect a realtime response to it. The most reliable way for you would be to use the `Unix` module and process the input using your own buffering.\r\n\r\n## The glitching input\r\n\r\nFinally, the input program can also give you the information in chunks. This is especially true for serial interfaces, so make sure that you have correctly set up your terminal interface using the `Unix.tcsetattr` function. In particular, when your program is blocked on the input, the operating system may decide not to wake it up on each arrived character or line. This behavior is controlled by the terminal interface (see the Canonical and Non-canonical modes. If your input doesn&#39;t have newlines, then you shall use the non-canonical mode). \r\n\r\nFinally, the device itself could be acting jittering, and if you have an oscilloscope nearby you can observe the signals it is sending.

Or have a custom widget which can hide its contents, which is what I&#39;ve done in the example below.\r\n\r\nYou specifically asked about fixed size... there&#39;s really a number of ways to go about this, depending on the exact needs.  You can set fixed sizes on the whole table by using the horizontal and vertical headers and making them non-resizable. Another way is to call `QTableView::setColumnWidth() / setRowHeight()` for each row/column (while adding/item or whenever).\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example using the former method (setting size on headers), and two ways to determine the actual size -- either a fixed size before building the table, or using a lookup on the custom widget item to determine a size.\r\n\r\n*UPDATE*: Previous version used a dummy `QTableWidgetItem` to fill in the blank areas, but I think this is better if one needs to use a custom widget anyway.

Because the DOM-Elements are different. Your own website has some DOM-tree you have formated it with your own CSS.\r\n\r\nThe included iframe website has an own different DOM-tree.\r\n\r\nI think the iframe is not the right way for that. If it&#39;s possible, you can read and parse the output source code of your iframe website and modify it via php.\r\n\r\nOr with Javascript Inspired from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/18516855/how-to-change-content-of-website-loaded-in-iframe\r\n\r\nFor php you can use that snippet:\r\n\r\n    $iframe_source = file_get_contents(&#39;http://www.example.com/&#39;);\r\n\r\nLook here at the php documentation for more information:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.php.net/manual/de/function.file-get-contents.php\r\n\r\nNow you can echo and modify also the DOM-tree of the iframe-page. You&#39;ve got the content and output from the page. You only need to echo $iframe_source.\r\nThan you can use your CSS file and take the .class or id of the element which you want to format.\r\n\r\nIt has some advantages but also some disadvantages:\r\n\r\nadvantages\r\n\r\n - content of iframe is also indexable\r\n - better than iframe\r\n - you can modify it\r\n - its JavaScript free\r\n\r\n\r\ndisadvantes\r\n\r\n - you need php and an server which allows file get contents\r\n - maybe some dynamic elements in the iframe wont work\r\n\r\nUpdate because it&#39;s some special case:\r\n\r\nitty.bitty.site is very different idea from normal webpages, you can finde something about the technique behind here:\r\n\r\nhttps://itty.bitty.site/#How_it_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 there is some base64encoding ans some differnt algorithm.

my case at least an `User-Agent` header was required and I could then use `requests`. You can then gather the parent nodes with a css class selector and then loop those parents and extract required info into a dataframe; again, using faster and short css selectors.

I.e. with three attachments it creates three e-mails all with the three attachments in each of them.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprivate void SendMail(List&lt;string&gt; paths)\r\n        {\r\n            DateTime defDt = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(3);\r\n            Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Application app = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Application();\r\n            Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.MailItem mailItem = app.CreateItem(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlItemType.olMailItem);\r\n            mailItem.BodyFormat = Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.OlBodyFormat.olFormatHTML;\r\n\r\n            mailItem.GetInspector.Activate();\r\n            var signature = mailItem.HTMLBody;\r\n            mailItem.HTMLBody = signature;\r\n            foreach (string u in paths)\r\n            {\r\n                mailItem.Attachments.Add(u);\r\n            }\r\n            mailItem.DeferredDeliveryTime = defDt;\r\n            mailItem.Display(mailItem);\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy does it behave like this? There are no foreach loop besides the one for adding the multiple attachments. When firing with one attachment the error doesn&#39;t show (probably since it i creating just one e-mail with one attachment as excpected).

Can `malloc(0)` return a non-null pointer, while `realloc(someptr, 0)` returns a null pointer?\r\n\r\nCan `calloc(0, 0)` be different from `malloc(0)`? It would have been simple for the `calloc()` specification to say that `calloc(nmemb, size)` is equivalent to `malloc(nmemb * size)` followed by zeroing the memory, but this equivalence is not explicit.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

the nested loops and letting Spark do it for you should significantly boost the performance. This requires two steps, expressed here as functions.\r\n\r\n**First step:** collect the unique values in each column in an array and transpose the dataframe.\r\n\r\n    from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n\r\n    def unique_and_transpose(df):\r\n        df = df.select([F.collect_set(col).alias(col) for col in df.columns])\r\n        params = []\r\n        for col in df.columns:\r\n            params.extend([F.lit(col), col])\r\n        return df.select(F.explode(F.create_map(*params)).alias(&#39;column&#39;, &#39;values&#39;))\r\n\r\nIf all columns are guaranteed to be free of duplicate values, `F.collect_set(col)` can be replaced with `F.collect_array(col)`. Gathering only the unique values is not strictly necessary, but it may speed up the second step.\r\n\r\nWhat this function does is best illustrated by an example:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df1.show()\r\n    +------+-----+----+\r\n    |  col1| col2|col3|\r\n    +------+-----+----+\r\n    |   red|  one| val|\r\n    | green|  two|   2|\r\n    |  blue|three| sda|\r\n    | black| nine| 452|\r\n    |purple|  ten| rww|\r\n    +------+-----+----+\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; unique_and_transpose(df1).show(3, False)\r\n    +------+---------------------------------+\r\n    |column|values                           |\r\n    +------+---------------------------------+\r\n    |col3  |[sda, 452, rww, 2, val]          |\r\n    |col1  |[blue, green, red, black, purple]|\r\n    |col2  |[nine, one, three, two, ten]     |\r\n    +------+---------------------------------+\r\n\r\n**Second step:** create a Cartesian product of the transposed datasets and derive the quantity you seek.\r\n\r\n    def cross_relate(df1, df2):\r\n        return df1.alias(&#39;df1&#39;).crossJoin(df2.alias(&#39;df2&#39;)).select(\r\n            F.col(&#39;df1.column&#39;).alias(&#39;col_1&#39;),\r\n            F.col(&#39;df2.column&#39;).alias(&#39;col_2&#39;),\r\n            F.size(F.array_intersect(&#39;df1.values&#39;, &#39;df2.values&#39;)).alias(&#39;nvals&#39;)\r\n        )\r\n\r\nThe Cartesian product does what the two nested loops do, but it only works row-wise, hence the need to first transpose the datasets.\r\n\r\nWith the help of those two functions, you can count the number of unique common values for each pair of columns like this:\r\n\r\n    df1_ut = unique_and_transpose(df1).cache()\r\n    df2_ut = unique_and_transpose(df2).cache()\r\n    df = cross_relate(df1_ut, df2_ut)\r\n\r\nThe result is:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; df.show()\r\n    +-----+-----+-----+\r\n    |col_1|col_2|nvals|\r\n    +-----+-----+-----+\r\n    | col3|col10|    0|\r\n    | col3| col9|    0|\r\n    | col3|col11|    3|\r\n    | col1|col10|    0|\r\n    | col1| col9|    3|\r\n    | col1|col11|    1|\r\n    | col2|col10|    2|\r\n    | col2| col9|    0|\r\n    | col2|col11|    0|\r\n    +-----+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nYou want a dictionary, so that&#39;s one more step:\r\n\r\n    res = {f&quot;{row.col_1},{row.col_2}&quot;: row.nvals for row in df.collect()}\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; from pprint import pprint\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; pprint(res)\r\n    {&#39;col1,col10&#39;: 0,\r\n     &#39;col1,col11&#39;: 1,\r\n     &#39;col1,col9&#39;: 3,\r\n     &#39;col2,col10&#39;: 2,\r\n     &#39;col2,col11&#39;: 0,\r\n     &#39;col2,col9&#39;: 0,\r\n     &#39;col3,col10&#39;: 0,\r\n     &#39;col3,col11&#39;: 3,\r\n     &#39;col3,col9&#39;: 0}\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455223/pyspark-merge-dataframe-and-count-values/58458322#58458322","title":"PySpark Merge dataframe and count values"}],"owner":{"reputation":1440,"user_id":9165263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/426b4b676073ad93681538933869a3cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rajat kabra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9165263/rajat-kabra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1440,"user_id":9165263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/426b4b676073ad93681538933869a3cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rajat kabra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9165263/rajat-kabra"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58458322,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571506400,"creation_date":1571417838,"last_edit_date":1571422413,"question_id":58455223,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455223","body_markdown":"I have two different dataframes and i want to find out the intersection count between `m` columns from `df1` and `n` columns from `df2`.

from using the numbers in days (for example: 16 for Thursday) to being able to write &quot;THU&quot; instead.\r\n\r\nRight now it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    $rebootDaysOfWeek = &quot;16&quot;

So as I understand I should only enable triggering this notification while application is in foreground (but what changes are needed here? `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = false` ?)\r\n\r\nAnd only use background user location updates when user has granted Always Authorization status. \r\n\r\nBut odd thing is that this blue bard indicator also appears while application is in foreground.  \r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nOk I have Ask Next Time set then Blue indicator is always displayed. \r\n\r\nIf there is While in Use then Blue indicator is only in background. \r\n\r\nIt here is Alway there is no blue indicator at all. \r\n\r\nI consider to add such delegate method \r\n\r\n    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didChangeAuthorization status: CLAuthorizationStatus) {\r\n            \r\n            print(&quot;Core Location authorization status: \\(status)&quot;)\r\n            \r\n            switch status {\r\n            case .authorizedAlways:\r\n                locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true\r\n            default:\r\n                locationManager.allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = false\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI think it should solve blue indicator obtrusive display in status bar. \r\nAnd the only problem will be that If user in iOS 13 selects While In Use then there will not be attempt to update location in background, so at the end there won&#39;t be occasion to display alert with question about Always Authorization, and the only possibility will be to user manually turn Always in Settings? \r\n\r\nSo my question here is how to make in iOS 13 it in that way the Alert with question about Always Authorization appear and only then change \r\n\r\n    .allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true\r\n\r\nto \r\n\r\n    .allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = false\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455214/ios-blue-status-bar-while-using-geofencing-background-location-updates-to-trigge","title":"iOS blue status bar while using geofencing/background location updates to trigger Notifications"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","keras","protocol-buffers"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36480,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571420538,"post_id":58455206,"comment_id":103248731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455206/cannot-find-the-variable-that-is-input-to-the-readvariableop#comment103248731_58455206"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11995307,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA6_0-i48LtFwKUUModDlT8xXqxDeavgmcbe7kTkXE=k-s128","display_name":"jesse brizzi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11995307/jesse-brizzi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571506357,"creation_date":1571506357,"answer_id":58466282,"question_id":58455206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58466282","body_markdown":"I just ran into this same issue, adding \r\n\r\n``` lang-python\r\nimport keras.backend as K\r\nk.set_learning_phase(0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich sets the learning phase to testing mode, was the solution.

The music player displays the current song&#39;s album art on a `UIImageView`. Whenever the song is playing, the `UIImageView` rotates (like a record on a record player).\r\n\r\n**What my problem is:**\r\nThe album art for the `UIImageView` is square by default. I am rounding the `UIImageView`&#39;s `layer`&#39;s corners and setting `UIImageView.clipsToBounds` equal to `true` to make it appear as a circle. \r\nWhenever the `UIImageView` rotates, some of the pixels outside of the `UIImageView`&#39;s `layer` (the part that is cut off after rounding the image) are bleeding through.\r\n\r\n**Here is what the bug looks like:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJxX5PQc7Jo&amp;feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\n**My code:**\r\nThe `UIImageView` is rounded by setting its `layer`&#39;s `cornerRadius` equal to `UIImageView.frame.height / 2` and setting `UIImageView.clipsToBounds = true`:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\r\n\r\n    @IBOutlet var albumArtImageView: UIImageView()\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n        albumArtImageView.layer.cornerRadius = albumArtImageView.frame.height / 2\r\n        albumArtImageView.clipsToBounds = true\r\n\r\n        //I&#39;ve also tried the following code, and am getting the same behavior:\r\n        /*\r\n        albumArtImageView.layer.cornerRadius = albumArtImageView.frame.height / 2\r\n        albumArtImageView.layer.masksToBounds = true\r\n        albumArtImageView.layer.maskedCorners = [.layerMinXMinYCorner, .layerMaxXMinYCorner,.layerMinXMaxYCorner, .layerMaxXMaxYCorner]\r\n        */\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhenever a button is pressed, the `UIImageView` begins to rotate. I&#39;ve used the following `extension` to make `UIView`&#39;s rotate:\r\n```swift\r\nextension UIView {\r\n    func rotate(duration: Double = 1, startPoint: CGFloat) {\r\n        if layer.animation(forKey: UIView.kRotationAnimationKey) == nil {\r\n            let rotationAnimation = CABasicAnimation(keyPath: &quot;transform.rotation&quot;)\r\n            \r\n            rotationAnimation.fromValue = startPoint\r\n            rotationAnimation.toValue = (CGFloat.pi * 2.0) + startPoint\r\n            rotationAnimation.duration = duration\r\n            rotationAnimation.repeatCount = Float.infinity\r\n            \r\n            layer.add(rotationAnimation, forKey: UIView.kRotationAnimationKey)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have the following extension to end the rotation:\r\n```swift\r\nextension UIView {\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    func stopRotating(beginTime: Double!, startingAngle: CGFloat) -&gt; CGFloat? {\r\n        if layer.animation(forKey: UIView.kRotationAnimationKey) != nil {\r\n            let animation = layer.animation(forKey: UIView.kRotationAnimationKey)!\r\n            let elapsedTime = CACurrentMediaTime() - beginTime\r\n            let angle = elapsedTime.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: animation.duration)/animation.duration\r\n            \r\n            layer.transform = CATransform3DMakeRotation((CGFloat(angle) * (2 * CGFloat.pi)) + startingAngle, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)\r\n            layer.removeAnimation(forKey: UIView.kRotationAnimationKey)\r\n            return (CGFloat(angle) * (2 * CGFloat.pi)) + startingAngle\r\n        } else {\r\n            return nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how these extension functions are used in the context of my view controller:\r\n```swift\r\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\r\n\r\n    var songBeginTime: Double!\r\n    var currentRecordAngle: CGFloat = 0.0\r\n    var isPlaying = false\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func playButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        if isPlaying {\r\n            if let angle = albumArtImageView.stopRotating(beginTime: songBeginTime, startingAngle: currentRecordAngle) {\r\n                currentRecordAngle = angle\r\n            }\r\n            songBeginTime = nil\r\n        } else {\r\n            songBeginTime = CACurrentMediaTime()\r\n            albumArtImageView.rotate(duration: 3, startPoint: currentRecordAngle)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, all together, `MyViewController` looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```swift\r\nclass MyViewController: UIViewController {\r\n\r\n    @IBOutlet var albumArtImageView: UIImageView()\r\n\r\n    var songBeginTime: Double!\r\n    var currentRecordAngle: CGFloat = 0.0\r\n    var isPlaying = false\r\n\r\n    override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n        super.viewDidLoad()\r\n        albumArtImageView.layer.cornerRadius = albumArtImageView.frame.height / 2\r\n        albumArtImageView.clipsToBounds = true\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @IBAction func playButtonPressed(_ sender: Any) {\r\n        if isPlaying {\r\n            if let angle = albumArtImageView.stopRotating(beginTime: songBeginTime, startingAngle: currentRecordAngle) {\r\n                currentRecordAngle = angle\r\n            }\r\n            songBeginTime = nil\r\n        } else {\r\n            songBeginTime = CACurrentMediaTime()\r\n            albumArtImageView.rotate(duration: 3, startPoint: currentRecordAngle)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455202/not-all-pixels-clipped-when-using-uiview-layer-clipstobounds-true-in-conjuncti","title":"Not all pixels clipped when using

function `letter()` assigns each button to the same variable name so naturally the last button assigned will be the only one that can be edited as all previous assignments have been overwritten.\r\n\r\nI would use a `list` to store your buttons and reference them per index.\r\nIn this case you do not need to bind the buttons when you can simply write a lambda function into the command argument of the button.\r\n\r\nBy working with the list to edit the button directly we can also work with the letter being selected by referencing the buttons `[&#39;text&#39;]` in the same `check` function and then do some work with that letter for your hangman game.\r\n\r\nNotice the below code is roughly 20 lines shorter than your code because we manage the `bind` or `command` within a loop instead of line by line. This is accomplished by simply iterating over a string of the upper case alphabet and using `enumerate` to get an index value of the list that can directly translate to the same index of the list used to store the buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n    import tkinter as tk\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    root = tk.Tk()\r\n    btn_list = []\r\n    root.title(&quot;HANGMAN&quot;)\r\n

I have done this with text without an issue but any other type of object is causing me issues.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a method that executes when inputting text in a &lt;InputNumber&gt; box which is based on the value inputted as well as several other inputs on the form.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;InputNumber step=&quot;.01&quot; class=&quot;form-control form-control-xs&quot; @bind-Value=&quot;@Salary&quot; @bind-Value:event=&quot;onkeydown&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\nprivate decimal salary {get; set;}\r\npublic decimal Salary\r\n{\r\n      get\r\n      {\r\n          return salary;\r\n      }\r\n      set\r\n      {\r\n          salary = value;\r\n          CalculationHere();\r\n      }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I do this, I get the below error:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also tried passing it in as a parameter like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@oninput=&quot;@((ChangeEventArgs __e) =&gt; CalculationHere(Convert.ToDecimal(__e.Value)&quot; \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also does not work as it causes an error when the textbox is empty and doesn&#39;t fire for all inputs (have tried on keydown as well). There are also a lot of parameters so if possible I&#39;d like to avoid this.\r\n\r\nI should also note that when I run this project, set a breakpoint in the method being called, and bind like the below, it DOES work. However, removing the breakpoint stops it from working. This has left me VERY confused.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;InputNumber step=&quot;.01&quot; class=&quot;form-control form-control-xs&quot; @bind-Value=&quot;@Salary&quot; @oninput=&quot;(() =&gt; CalculationHere())&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a best practice regarding this? I&#39;m new to web development and Blazor itself is very new so I&#39;m not sure what the best route to go here is... Any advice?

If I wrap the object I send in driver.touchPerform in an array like so:\r\n```\r\nconst el = driver.$(&#39;//*[@name=&quot;MyButton&quot;]&#39;);\r\ndriver.touchPerform([\r\n      { action: &#39;tap&#39;, options: { element: el } }\r\n]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get the same error as the previous: **Request failed due to java.util.LinkedHashMap cannot be cast to java.lang.String**\r\n\r\nMy question is, **am I using the wrong selection or touch type event to click on a button on a mobile device?**\r\n\r\nI have also tried the http://appium.io/docs/en/commands/element/actions/click/ method, and when I try that it tells me `driver.$(..).click() is not a function`\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.

I&#39;m doing a similar thing where to get the next entry of the nth row of Pascal&#39;s triangle I multiply the previous entry in the row by (n-r+1)/r. But because everything is very large and I&#39;m working in modulo p (for a very large p, e.g. 10^9+7) I have to find the multiplicative inverse of r (rather than divide by it). I have since realised the overhead is coming from inverting r via Fermat&#39;s Little theorem (the modinverse function shown below) but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a way to invert faster than this (extended Euclidean algorithm is slower).\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s the fastest way in Python to generate the nth row of Pascal&#39;s triangle (modulo p for some large prime p)? I&#39;m looking for a method that can do up to the 10000000&#39;s row in under 5 seconds. Note I only need a specific row, not the entire triangle\r\n\r\nCurrently I&#39;m just doing the obvious thing where to get the next entry in the row (say representing n choose r) I multiply the previous entry in the row by (n-r+1)/r, which works but takes about 25 seconds to generate for example the 10000000th row which is too slow for my purposes. I only need to generate up to half of the row by symmetry of Pascal&#39;s triangle.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do this that is significantly faster, using Python and without libraries like numpy?\r\n\r\nAttempt so far:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef pascalnthrowmodp(n,p):\r\n    nthrow = [0] * (int((n+1)/2)+1)\r\n    nchooser = 1\r\n    nthrow[0]=nchooser\r\n    for r in range(1,int((n+1)/2)+1):\r\n        nchooser=nchooser*(n-r+1)*modpinverse(r,p) % p\r\n        nthrow[r]=nchooser\r\n    return nthrow\r\n```\r\n\r\nmodpinverse(r,p) is just a function which evaluates the inverse of r modulo p via Fermat&#39;s Little Theorem\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef modpinverse(x,p):\r\n    y = pow(x, p - 2, p) #Fermat&#39;s little theorem\r\n    return y\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455146/fastest-way-to-generate-nth-row-of-pascals-triangle","title":"Fastest way to generate nth row of Pascal&#39;s

This is not my speciality so while I can articulate what I want, and what I think may work, I am trying to steer away from failure paths.\r\n\r\nFor now, assume tha the raw data are similar to several large corpora of text that are split into sequences (e.g. sentences), which each include a number of tokens (e.g. words). I extract, process and save information on a sentence-token basis, but require different operations on it in following analyses. \r\nSpecifically, each token, in each sentence, is associated with a large vector (which can be numerical) that is prepared by a number of operations that are already implemented. Each sequence is associated with some metadata. This operation and thereby the preparation of this data occurs only once.\r\n\r\nSo: the output of the inital operation is a three dimensional tensor D[x,y,z] plus metadata associated with the x dimension. The x dimension denotes the sequence, the y the token position in the sequence (but not the unique token-id, e.g. the word encoding, that is part of the sequence metadata), and the z are the columns (many thousands) of information for that token. So each sequence is associated with a matrix of tokens as rows, and information as columns. The metadata can probably be made to fit into the first row if necessary. Note that each sequence is of the same length.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSequence 1\r\nMeta-data: [..]\r\n         Column 1 | Column 2 | ...\r\nToken 1 |  [...]  |   [...]  | ...    \r\nToken 2 |  [...]  |   [...]  | ...   \r\n...\r\nToken N |  [...]  |   [...]  | ... \r\n\r\nSequence 2\r\nMeta-data: [..]\r\n         Column 1 | Column 2 | ...\r\nToken 1 |  [...]  |   [...]  | ...    \r\nToken 2 |  [...]  |   [...]  | ...   \r\n...\r\nToken N |  [...]  |   [...]  | ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis data is ingested multiple times by different subsequent analyses. I therefore require different &quot;views&quot; of this data, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. I need to be able to query each sequence and get the full matrix of token-&gt;values. That is simply the output 3D tensor, where I query along the first dimension. It would be nice to be able to &quot;slice&quot; multiple sequences at once (e.g. random batches for ML models etc.)\r\n\r\n2. I need like to be able to query by unique token-id (e.g. the word &quot;hello&quot;), noting that each token may occur in several sequences and at different positions. This is not a query into the dimension of a tensor, but rather requries data that maps unique token-ids to their positions in the sequences (or metadata within each sequence allowing such a query).\r\n\r\n3. I finally generate and save further summary values for each token per sequence, that I seek to query extremely quickly, where other information from that sequence is not relevant.\r\n\r\nWhat all subsequent modeling has in common is\r\n\r\n- I need as much RAM as possible for the subsequent analyses, or in other words, the data may or may not need to be pushed to disk. That is why I am looking for a solution that allows both in-memory and out-memory access. In particular, the whole tensor may not fit into memory at all (it is built up subsequently over the x dimension)\r\n\r\n- Given the fixed structure, indexing and slicing is relatively straightforward, but I may often need to select non-adjacent entries, such as tokens from unrelated sequences.\r\n\r\n- The whole thing should not bottleneck the subsequent analyses. It would also be beneficial if it is somewhat portable and does not require additional software, such that the results can be distributed and reproduced easily by other researchers. In fact, I would like to make this data available to download if it turns out to be possible (legally)\r\n\r\n- Since this is an input, I am primarily interested in speed to access these data from python or other languages.\r\n\r\nBased on this, I have tentatively settled on using either h5py or pyTables, but I am open to other options.\r\n\r\nWhile the data is large, it is not so large that disk space is an issue (on a moderately sized server). I further iterate over each sequence at least once to perform the initial operations. I therefore plan to save each required &quot;view&quot; into separate datasets, each layed out to enable efficient access.\r\n\r\n**My plan is as follows:**\r\n\r\n1. I save the output tensor as a multi-dimensional array in pyTables. The index dimension is going to be the sequence number. I may query several sequences, but always ingest the 2D table of a whole sequence. My hope is that pyTables allows me to keep the whole 3D tensor on disk, and only read the required data into RAM.\r\n\r\n2. I will save a new dataset that has the unique token-id as index, sequence-id as second column and then the required information as array. This way, I can query by token-id and get all data associated in all sequences. This includes a lot of duplication, but should allow for fast querying (?)\r\n\r\n3. I will finally make a smaller dataset with the associated summary data for each token-id (as index) for each sequence.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo you think that would be efficient in terms of computation time?\r\n\r\nThe other route I see would be a relational database, like SQL. Here, I could simply make entries for each actual word in a sequence, with associated token-id, sequence number and the data I need. An SQL query could then be used to get the data in any way I choose. Further, any metadata could be saved in other tables either by sequence or token without much restrictions.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am not sure if that is the fastest option, since I do not require many things SQL provides, such as additional flexibility (my queries / views are fixed and indexing/slicing is always along a fixed dimension) or all the access protections and all that. Plus, portability is better if its just some dataset files.\r\n\r\nI am also not sure how SQL handles in-memory and out-memory issues. There may be instances when large parts of my data actually fits in RAM, so I want the flexbility there as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Questions:**\r\n\r\n- What is your sense of the best approach? Is my plan sound?\r\n\r\n- SQL seems clearly more flexible, is it perhaps even faster?\r\n\r\n- What I do not yet understand in HDF5 is how chunking and groups play into this. It seems I can not really chunk my data, because I need to be able to query non-successive data with high frequency. Is it correct that for my use-case, I should not chunk?\r\n\r\n- Similarly, groups and links. My data structure does not resemble a tree, because each token may occur in many sequences, which is why I chose to just produce different datasets entirely. Would it be more efficient to try to use hard links or groups?\r\n\r\n- How would the memory model of HDF5 work (as implemented in python)? Is it true that I can query, say, the 3D tensor, and only keep the results in memory, but also have a cache for sequences or tokens that are frequently queried?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf my description is not clear, please let me know.

For example I want to make sure that nothing that core depends on ends up in `shared` as this would create a circular dependency.\r\n\r\nNow I can certainly go through and do this manually, but this is not a small application and it will take a significant amount of time and will be error prone.

If a user has been blacklisted, then we do not want to allow them to remove any funds from the account but we do want to record that they have tried to.\r\n\r\nAfter the request is made, we could query the user model to see if the blacklist exists.

In other words, if this piece of state is only kept in one place, then it&#39;s impossible to have a conflict between different versions, because different versions don&#39;t exist. And this in turn means you don&#39;t have to devote any effort or code to trying to keep states in sync with eachother.\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nNow in principle you might think of having the child component be that single source of truth. But the way react is designed, props always flow from the top of the component tree to the bottom. A parent component passes props to a child component, not vice versa, so react makes it very convenient for the state to exist in the parent component and then be passed to a child. \r\n\r\nAs you mentioned, the child could notify the parent of changes, which would be done through a function prop. But in order for the parent to rerender and use this new data, it will then need to set state on itself (`setState` causes `render`). And now the state is being kept in two places, which is the thing we were trying to avoid.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455112/from-oop-to-reactjs-why-i-should-remove-the-local-state-from-a-component-and-mo/58455193#58455193","title":"From OOP to ReactJs: Why I should remove the local State from a Component and move it to their Parent?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2676,"user_id":2115971,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zkMcT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"richbai90","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2115971/richbai90"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571417955,"creation_date":1571417955,"answer_id":58455245,"question_id":58455112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455245","body_markdown":"The design philosophy is known as smart vs dumb components and it becomes more useful when dealing with larger state management libraries like `Redux`. The goal is to separate your logical components, those that deal with manipulating the state, interacting with other libraries like `Redux` etc. From view components. That way your view gets to be a pure function, reacting only to the parameters passed explicitly to it. This makes them extremely easy to test. And you only have to test that your smart components are passing the correct values to the view only components. Decoupling in this way makes testing smoother and prevents a variety of bugs that could otherwise be difficult to track down.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455112/from-oop-to-reactjs-why-i-should-remove-the-local-state-from-a-component-and-mo/58455245#58455245","title":"From OOP to ReactJs: Why I should remove the local State from a Component and move it to their Parent?"}],"owner":{"reputation":591,"user_id":1901823,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc6bcf625498eb28becb1f91356f6718?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mariano L","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1901823/mariano-l"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571418710,"creation_date":1571417381,"question_id":58455112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455112","body_markdown":"I would say that I have good experience with a lot of OOP languages. Most with Java. I&#39;ve made full stack development with Spring boot and now i&#39;m trying to learn React. \r\n\r\nMy point with all this is that maybe I&#39;m to used to OOP languages so there are some &quot;design philosophies&quot; that I cannot understand. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve started with this tutorial video:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s pretty great and clear but I have an issue in one part in particular: \r\n\r\n1:47:55 **Removing the Local State**\r\n\r\nTo summarize the video, he makes an component called Counters that contains N componentes called Counter.  This component Counter is just one number and a button that every time is pressed the value should increments by 1.\r\n\r\nOriginally, this value was stored as an state in the Counter component. This makes sense thinking in a OOP way. But then, in that chapter from the video he suggested to remove that state and mantain that value in the parent component, Counters.\r\n\r\nAnd every time the button &quot;INCREASE&quot; is pressed, what is doing is calling Increment in the parent component. The value is stored in Counters. Not Counter.\r\n\r\n[![introducir la descripci&#243;n de la imagen aqu&#237;][1]][1]\r\n\r\n**Now, my question:** Why not keep the VALUE state in the Counter component, and everytime is increased, inform the parent component that this happened?\r\n\r\nHow is this design philophy called? Any tutorial/book/video that explain this better for the people that comes from a OOP background? \r\n\r\nSorry is this is a dumb question.
