Now, after running its startup code, showing some components, doing some things, then we get a [Variant 119 error][1] ([ref issues or multiple versions of React][2]).\r\n\r\nSince the code used to work the `ref` thing seems spurious, but I checked all our refs (there are a total of two). I did the usual `npm ls` and `yarn list`, even checked a lot of modules for additional Reacts, but found nada.\r\n\r\nOur `yarn.lock` file has not changed other than some internal dependencies that aren&#39;t Electron or React related. No external components (BlueprintJS, Semantic UI React, ...) have changed over the course of working-to-non-working.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the kicker: reverting to previously-working versions (including deleting `node_modules` etc.) doesn&#39;t help. The build machine is running the same version of NodeJS as it has been (10.15.mumble). I&#39;ve tried to track down caches (including Yarn) and deleted them, deleted the `out` directory, done full rebuilds, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat could be impacting an Electron Forge build like this? What other code, directories, caches, configurations, etc. should I be looking for? \r\n\r\nThat it impacts previously-working versions points me towards build/environment problems, although this happens across machines, which points back at the project. After multiple days bisecting and rebuilding and having the same thing happen I&#39;ve paid a visit to Witt&#39;s End. And I don&#39;t like it there.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-decoder.html/?invariant=119\r\n  [2]: https://reactjs.org/warnings/refs-must-have-owner.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158791/electron-forge-react-etc-build-has-gone-mad","title":"Electron Forge, React, etc. build has gone mad"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":754,"user_id":10740966,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07256f72861352f5f9d0b5d82936f9e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"manwithfewneeds","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10740966/manwithfewneeds"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569789215,"post_id":58158789,"comment_id":102700314,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158789/empty-dataframe-but-series-of-same-dataframe-contains-values#comment102700314_58158789"}],"owner":{"reputation":1780,"user_id":4046274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/f4aeF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pirate X","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4046274/pirate-x"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569787613,"creation_date":1569787613,"question_id":58158789,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158789","body_markdown":"I have a dataframe `df_graph` which has three columns as below- \r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;print(df_graph)\r\n\r\n    Empty DataFrame\r\n    Columns: [State, State Winner, Num of times]\r\n    Index: []\r\n\r\nif I check each series manually, It returns all the values.

should be executed.\r\n\r\nBut I am not sure where am I going wrong, because I getting stuck in the while loop and not coming out. Can someone help me with where am i going wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158776/mqtt-with-python-getting-stuck-in-a-loop","title":"mqtt with python, getting stuck

just ran a quick test of your scraper and it seems to me that it&#39;s actually working as it&#39;s supposed to.\r\n\r\n*EDIT: In an attempt to make my explanation more clear; you cannot scrape 301 or 302 redirects, because they are just that; redirects. If you request a URL that gets redirected, Scrapy automatically handles that for you and scrapes the data from the page that you get redirected to. It is the final destination from the redirect that will give you the 200 response.*\r\n\r\n*If you follow the logic I have presented below, you will see that Scrapy requests the URL http://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;fccid=b87e01ade6c824ee&amp;vjs=3, but gets redirected to https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3. It is this final page that you will be able to scrape. (You can try it yourself by clicking the initial URL and comparing that to the final URL you end up on)*\r\n\r\n***Just to repeat myself, you will not be able to scrape anything from the 301 and 302 redirects (there is nothing there to scrape), only the final page that gets 200 response.***\r\n\r\n*I have attached a suggested version of your scraper that saves both the requested URL and the scraped URL. Everything looks fine to me, your scraper works as it is supposed to. (However, note that indeed.com will only server you up to 19 pages of search results, which limits you to 190 scraped items)*\r\n\r\n*I hope this makes better sense now.*\r\n\r\nHere is one example from the output, starting with the original request:\r\n\r\n    2019-09-30 10:37:06 [scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect] DEBUG: Redirecting (301) to &lt;GET https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;fccid=b87e01ade6c824ee&amp;vjs=3&gt; from &lt;GET http://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;fccid=b87e01ade6c824ee&amp;vjs=3&gt;\r\n\r\nThis gets redirected with a 301 redirect to the next link:\r\n\r\n    2019-09-30 10:37:06 [scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect] DEBUG: Redirecting (302) to &lt;GET https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3&gt; from &lt;GET https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;fccid=b87e01ade6c824ee&amp;vjs=3&gt;\r\n\r\nWhich again gets redirected with a 302 redirect to the next link:\r\n\r\n    2019-09-30 10:37:07 [scrapy.core.engine] DEBUG: Crawled (200) &lt;GET https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3&gt; (referer: None)\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we can scrape the data:\r\n\r\n    2019-09-30 10:37:07 [scrapy.core.scraper] DEBUG: Scraped from &lt;200 https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;from=serp&amp;vjs=3&gt; \r\n    {&#39;title&#39;: &#39;General Manager&#39;, &#39;posting_url&#39;: &#39;https://indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=69995bf12d9f2f9a&amp;fccid=b87e01ade6c824ee&amp;vjs=3&#39;, &#39;job_name&#39;: &#39;General Manager&#39;, &#39;job_location&#39;: &#39;Plano, TX 75024&#39;, &#39;job_description_1&#39;: [], &#39;posted_on_date&#39;: &#39; - 30+ days ago&#39;, &#39;job_description_2&#39;: None}\r\n\r\n**So the data is scraped from the final page that received a 200 response.** Note that in the scraped item, the `posting_url` is the one passed in with the `meta` attribute, and not the actual scraped url. This may be what you want, but if you want to save the actual url that was scraped, then you should use `posting_url = response.url` instead. **EDIT: See suggested update below**\r\n\r\nSuggested code update:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport scrapy\r\n\r\n\r\nclass JobsSpider(scrapy.Spider):\r\n    name = &quot;jobs&quot;\r\n    allowed_domains = [&quot;indeed.com&quot;]\r\n    start_urls = [&quot;https://www.indeed.com/jobs?q=%22owner+operator%22&amp;l=dallas&quot;]\r\n\r\n    def parse(self, response):\r\n        jobs = response.xpath(&#39;//div[@class=&quot;title&quot;]&#39;)\r\n\r\n        for job in jobs:\r\n            title = job.xpath(&#39;a//@title&#39;).extract_first()\r\n            posting_link = job.xpath(&#39;a//@href&#39;).extract_first()\r\n            referer_url = &quot;https://indeed.com&quot; + posting_link\r\n\r\n            yield scrapy.Request(url=referer_url,\r\n                                 callback=self.parse_page,\r\n                                 meta={&#39;title&#39;: title,\r\n                                       &#39;referer_url&#39;: referer_url,\r\n                                       }\r\n                                 )\r\n\r\n        relative_next_url = response.xpath(&#39;//link[@rel=&quot;next&quot;]/@href&#39;).extract_first()\r\n        if relative_next_url:\r\n            absolute_next_url = &quot;https://indeed.com&quot; + relative_next_url\r\n            yield scrapy.Request(absolute_next_url, callback=self.parse)\r\n        else:\r\n            self.logger.info(&#39;No more pages found.&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\n    def parse_page(self, response):\r\n        referer_url = response.meta.get(&#39;referer_url&#39;)\r\n        title = response.meta.get(&#39;title&#39;)\r\n        job_location = response.meta.get(&#39;job_location&#39;)\r\n        posting_url = response.url\r\n\r\n        job_name= response.xpath(&#39;//*[@class=&quot;icl-u-xs-mb--xs icl-u-xs-mt--none  jobsearch-JobInfoHeader-title&quot;]/text()&#39;).extract_first()\r\n        job_description_1=response.xpath(&#39;//div[@class=&quot;jobsearch-jobDescriptionText&quot;]/ul&#39;).extract()\r\n        posted_on_date= response.xpath(&#39;//div[@class=&quot;jobsearch-JobMetadataFooter&quot;]/text()&#39;).extract_first()\r\n        job_location=response.xpath(&#39;//*[@class=&quot;jobsearch-InlineCompanyRating icl-u-xs-mt--xs  jobsearch-DesktopStickyContainer-companyrating&quot;]/div[3]/text()&#39;).extract_first()\r\n        job_description_2=response.xpath(&#39;//div[@class=&quot;jobsearch-JobComponent-description  icl-u-xs-mt--md  &quot;]/text()&#39;).extract_first()\r\n\r\n        yield {&#39;title&#39;: title,\r\n               &#39;posting_url&#39;: posting_url,\r\n               &#39;referer_url&#39;: referer_url,\r\n               &#39;job_name&#39;: job_name,\r\n               &#39;job_location&#39;: job_location,\r\n               &#39;job_description_1&#39;: job_description_1,\r\n               &#39;posted_on_date&#39;: posted_on_date,\r\n               &#39;job_description_2&#39;: job_description_2,\r\n               &#39;job_location&#39;: job_location\r\n               }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158766/unable-to-scrape-stats-code-301-and-302-using-scrapy/58164502#58164502","title":"Unable to scrape stats code 301 and 302 using scrapy"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12060569,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uRwNNgL-mjE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4IPoZNmA52Rw6QhrmFx3yb19OsQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"bobparker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12060569/bobparker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12060569,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uRwNNgL-mjE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc4IPoZNmA52Rw6QhrmFx3yb19OsQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"bobparker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12060569/bobparker"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58164502,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569925170,"creation_date":1569787378,"last_edit_date":1569904024,"question_id":58158766,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158766","body_markdown":"Good Afternoon all\r\n\r\nI have run into a small issue trying to scrape data from job posting site, I am also somewhat newer to python and scrapy as a whole. \r\n\r\nI have a script that I am running to extract data from various indeed postings.

our release pipeline, we have a console app that performs a function which generates an encryption key and outputs it to STDOUT. We need to be able to use this value in a variable during deployment (updating a configuration file with the results from the console app). We&#39;ve tried using the Output Variables option in the command line task in Azure Devops but unfortunately we need it in a different format... and it just doesn&#39;t seem to work as expected.\r\n\r\nE.g. Our cmd line tool outputs `908321093RANDOMLYGENERATEDKEY3422543` to STDOUT\r\n\r\nThe name in our config file for that key is something like ```Settings.Security.OurKey``` however the output variable in the command line task does not allow periods (.) and as such is set to ```SettingsSecurityOurKey```... we&#39;ve also tried SETTINGS_SECURITY_OURKEY, but the variable value is never set by the task.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to somehow set the Azure Devops variable to the value of the output variable from the command line or a powershell script? Something like:\r\n\r\n    set $(Settings.Security.OurKey) = SettingsSecurityOurKey\r\n\r\nOr is there a simpler method of achieving this? It seems like it shouldn&#39;t be that difficult..","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158763/substitute-variable-as-an-input-from-the-stdout-of-a-console-application","title":"Substitute

`Itens[0].Grife`, and on another row `Index[1].Grife` and so on...\r\n\r\nIt is working ok, but when I remove a row on the table, I need the index to be updated, because if I remove the `index[0]` (first row), the others row begin on the `[1]` index and my server crash.\r\n\r\nAny way to update the entire index of the rows when a row is deleted?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158757/update-a-dynamic-created-js-html-table-after-a-row-is-deleted","title":"Update a dynamic created JS html table after a row

I have defined some predicates which characterise inhabitants of Node, namely: `Orphan`, `Terminal`, and `Isolated`.  \r\n\r\nWhat I want to do - but have not yet achieved - is to define a predicate `Link` which models the linking of two Node such that one Node becomes the successor (`succ`) of the other.  Moreover, I would like to restrict the operation such that links can only be made to `Isolated` Nodes.  Furthermore, I would like the restriction - if it is possible - to somehow be _internal to the `Link` predicate_.  \r\n\r\nHere is my latest attempt:\r\n\r\n```alloy\r\nsig Data {}\r\n\r\nsig Node {\r\n\tdata: Data,\r\n\tsucc: lone Node\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Node characterisation\r\npred Isolated (n: Node) { Orphan[n] and Terminal[n] }\r\n\r\npred Orphan (n: Node) { no m: Node | m.succ = n }\r\n\r\npred Terminal (n: Node) { no n.succ }\r\n\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * Link\r\n * \r\n * May only Link n to an m, when:\r\n * \t- n differs from m\r\n *  - m is an Isolated Node (DOES NOT WORK)\r\n *\r\n * After the operation: \r\n * \t- m is the succcessor of n\r\n */\r\npred Link (n,m: Node) {\r\n\tn != m\r\n\tIsolated[m] /* Not satisfiable */\r\n\tm = succ[n]\r\n}\r\n\r\npred LinkFeasible { some n,m: Node | Link[n,m] }\r\n\r\nrun LinkFeasible\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncluding the conjunct `Isolated[m]` renders the model unsatisfiable.  I think I understand why: there can be no `Node` which is both `Isolated` _and_ a successor of another.  I include it only in the hope that it might reveal my intentions.\r\n\r\nMy question: how do I define the `Link` predicate to link two Nodes such that only `Isolated` nodes may be linked-to?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158723/linked-data-structures-restricting-a-link-operation","title":"Linked Data Structures: Restricting a link operation"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","flot"],"owner":{"reputation":84,"user_id":5896263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db05bd944f585f31566d1548c2ce2214?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J_J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5896263/j-j"},"last_editor":{"reputation":84,"user_id":5896263,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db05bd944f585f31566d1548c2ce2214?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"J_J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5896263/j-j"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569878069,"creation_date":1569786988,"last_edit_date":1569878069,"question_id":58158720,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158720","body_markdown":"I have this graphic made with Jquery Flot Chart.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI need to put the sum of the data for each column, something like that:\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\nI found this article:\r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40528551/flotchart-stacked-bar-total-label][3]\r\nInitially it didn&#39;t work, but now I see that it is a conflict with the jquery.flot.categories.js plugin.

Why does it exist in the first place when all it does is importing from another module and `__main__` just imports from that script. Why can&#39;t you run `__main__.py` and have it import from `module1` directly?\r\n\r\nYou can place this code at the top of `package_test.py` and inspect the output:\r\n\r\n    import sys\r\n    print(sys.path)\r\n\r\n    import package_test\r\n    print(sys.modules)\r\n    print(package_test)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158704/how-do-i-run-the-main-script-of-a-python-package-directly/58158915#58158915","title":"How do I run the main script of a Python package directly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1511,"user_id":6501141,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UhrNj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LightCC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6501141/lightcc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58158915,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569788651,"creation_date":1569786890,"question_id":58158704,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158704","body_markdown":"I have an issue on a large set of scripts I&#39;ve put into a package, and setup a test repo `package_test` to get things working, as shown below.

in Julia fully support the UTF-8 encoding standard for Unicode characters.\r\nThis, however makes the encoding size of a single character variable, depending on the character.\r\n\r\nStandard ASCII characters (code points less than 128) use one byte and produce the expected behavior during the iteration. However, because the em-dash `—` is part of the extended ASCII character set, it produces an error when trying to index using a uniform step size. More on strings and their behavior can be found in the [documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/strings/) (specifically the section &quot;Unicode and UTF-8&quot;).\r\n\r\n**Edit:** As Stefan mentioned in the comments, note that `length(str)` behaves in the expected way and returns the actual number of characters in the string. The last index position can be retrieved via `lastindex(str)`.\r\n\r\nThis error can be circumvented in multiple ways, depending on the desired behavior:\r\n\r\n**Option 1:** Iterating over the string elements directly  \r\nIf the index is not relevant, this is the easiest way to go about it:\r\n```julia\r\nfor c in str\r\n  println(c)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option 2:** Using `eachindex` to extract the correct string indices  \r\nIf the actual index position in the string is relevant, one can do:\r\n```julia\r\nfor bi in eachindex(str)\r\n  println(bi, str[bi])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option 3:** Using `enumerate` to get linear index positions and characters  \r\nIf the &quot;character&quot; index (i.e. the index/number of the current character, **not** its byte index) into the string and the corresponding character are relevant:\r\n```julia\r\nfor (ci, c) in enumerate(str)\r\n  println(ci, c)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n**Edit 2:** Added a small example to clarify.\r\nUsing the string `str = &quot;a ∀ x ∃ y&quot;` as an example.\r\n\r\n**Option 1** returns:\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; for c in str; print(c, &quot; | &quot;); end\r\na |   | ∀ |   | x |   | ∃ |   | y | \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Option 2** returns:\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; for bi in eachindex(str); print(bi, &quot; &quot;, str[bi], &quot; | &quot;); end\r\n1 a | 2   | 3 ∀ | 6   | 7 x | 8   | 9 ∃ | 12   | 13 y |\r\n```\r\nNote e.g. the jump from 3 -&gt; 6\r\n\r\n**Option 3** returns:\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; for (ci, c) in enumerate(str); print(ci, &quot; &quot;, c, &quot; | &quot;); end\r\n1 a | 2   | 3 ∀ | 4   | 5 x | 6   | 7 ∃ | 8   | 9 y | \r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158693/iterating-through-string-fails-with-stringindexerror/58158694#58158694","title":"Iterating through string fails with StringIndexError"}],"owner":{"reputation":330,"user_id":9927044,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a8a1d22fce068abe0c45e8ca040daaf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wolf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9927044/wolf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":572,"user_id":1616622,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AD515.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saxtheowl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1616622/saxtheowl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58158694,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569832250,"creation_date":1569786821,"last_edit_date":1569789509,"question_id":58158693,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158693","body_markdown":"**Note:** This question was motivated by this [discourse thread](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/crash-on-examining-corrupted-text-data/29296).\r\n\r\nConsider the following example string:\r\n```julia\r\nstr = &quot;This is some text that initially consists of normal ASCII characters—but oh wait, the em-dash is only part of the extended ASCII character set!&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrying to iterate through this string using its length:\r\n```julia\r\nfor i in 1:length(str)\r\n  println(i, str[i])\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFails with an `StringIndexError`, returning the following message half-way through the loop:\r\n```julia\r\nERROR: StringIndexError(&quot;This is some text that initially consists of normal ASCII characters—but oh wait, the em-dash is only part of the extended ASCII character set!&quot;, 70)\r\nStacktrace:\r\n [1] string_index_err(::String, ::Int64) at ./strings/string.jl:12\r\n [2] getindex_continued(::String, ::Int64, ::UInt32) at ./strings/string.jl:217\r\n [3] getindex(::String, ::Int64) at ./strings/string.jl:210\r\n [4] top-level scope at ./REPL[4]:2\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the reason for this behavior?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158693/iterating-through-string-fails-with-stringindexerror","title":"Iterating through string fails with StringIndexError"},{"tags":["java","animation"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11053554,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bhy8U.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Photon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11053554/photon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569810081,"creation_date":1569810081,"answer_id":58160798,"question_id":58158691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160798","body_markdown":"I&#39;m confused how you have this working since you are not showing any code.

If all seats are booked in a category, they should be given the choice to book a ticket in the other one. In any case, when they book a ticket, they should be notified that they booked a ticket, in which category it is, and the seat number. If there are no seats available at all, they should get a notification that &quot;The next plane leaves in 3 hours&quot;.\r\n\r\nI have done the code, but I have this problem: it works fine if the original array has all elements equal to zero. But as soon as even one element is equal to 1, I get the notification that all seats are booked in said category.\r\n\r\nI believe my mistake lies in the beginning of my &#39;for&#39; loops, but I can not exactly put my finger on it (since I am very new to this). \r\nThe goal of my &#39;for&#39; loops was to look in 5 specific array elements at a time, and as soon as there is one that is equal to 0, stop, replace the value with 1 and print the ticket &amp; exit the programme.\r\n\r\nSo this is the code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint linearSearch(const int[], int, int);\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n  const int arraySize = 10;\r\n  int plane[arraySize] = {0};\r\n  int seat, i;\r\n  string answer;\r\n  int check = 1;\r\n  int level = 5;\r\n\r\n  int element = linearSearch(plane, check, level);\r\n\r\n  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Please press 1 for first class and 2 for economy.&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n  cin &gt;&gt; seat;\r\n\r\n  switch (seat) {\r\n    case 1: {\r\n      for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {\r\n        int element = linearSearch(plane, check, level);\r\n        if (element == -1) {\r\n          plane[i] = 1;\r\n          cout &lt;&lt; &quot;You have booked a seat at first class, and you are seated &quot;\r\n                  &quot;at seat number &quot;\r\n               &lt;&lt; plane[i] &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n          break;\r\n        } else\r\n          cout &lt;&lt; &quot;There are no seats available in first class.

If you want to use the _value_ of the object, you must use the `get` method:\r\n\r\n    self.root.after(self.timeAmount.get(), self.running)\r\n\r\nYou also have several other problems in this line of code:\r\n\r\n    timeButton = Button(master, text=&#39;Set delay&#39;, command=self.timeAmount.set(timeEntry.get()))\r\n        \r\n\r\nIt produces the exact same result as this:\r\n\r\n    value = timeEntry.get()\r\n    result = self.timeAmount.set(value)\r\n    timeButton = Button(master, text=&#39;Set delay&#39;, command=result)\r\n\r\nThe `command` attribute requires a _callable_. Under most circumstances it is best if you define a function, and put code to execute in the function. Also, in the code you wrote you&#39;re getting the value of `timeEntry` just a few milliseconds after creating it, so the user won&#39;t have a chance to change the value.\r\n\r\nInstead, create a function and then reference that function. For example:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, master):\r\n        ...\r\n        self.timeEntry = Entry(master)\r\n        timeButton = Button(master, text=&#39;Set delay&#39;, command=self.set_delay)\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n    def set_delay(self):\r\n        new_value = self.timeEntry.get()\r\n        self.timeAmount.set(new_value)\r\n\r\nBy putting the code in a function it will be easier to understand and easier to debug.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158677/tkinter-root-after-variable/58159125#58159125","title":"Tkinter root.after variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12139795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eb9dab80927a6f2edfcb9429828ce892?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"RaceLuden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139795/raceluden"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58159125,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569790541,"creation_date":1569786725,"question_id":58158677,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158677","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make a Tkinter entry where i can change the root.after delay amount, but i get an error that i don&#39;t quite understand.

So in a sense, web pages can contain executables that run when they are viewed.\r\n\r\nFinally, Java&#39;s mechanism for inclusion into a web page is not just one thing.  In the early days, it&#39;s inclusion into a web page included &quot;java applets&quot;, which after a period of adoption, eventually became under-used, and finally saw most web browsers drop support in an effort to reduce the ways one can delivery web page malware.\r\n\r\nA second web page delivery of Java has been introduced, JNLP, or &quot;Java Web Start&quot;.  In this approach, following a web page link would cause a Java program to be downloaded to the machine, and the program would run.  This was an improvement in the security compared to applets, but not enough of a security improvement to satisfy all people.  JNLP, again primarily due to the low adation / bad press ratio, was dropped.\r\n\r\nThis means that the only remaining options for Java related to web pages are:\r\n\r\n1. Use the link to download a full fledged Java program (perhaps an installer)\r\n2. Build the Java application on the server side, so the Java code doesn&#39;t need to ever run in the web page (ok, actually the web browser), but only inputs and outputs web pages.\r\n\r\nMost web applications have been doing #2 for quite some time now.  Most pre-web applications have been doing #1 for even longer.\r\n\r\nNote that the installed program doesn&#39;t need to be web unaware, it can still connect to back end Java Web Services, which use web technology, but are not &quot;Java code running in a web browser&quot;.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, and if you&#39;re a fan of Java, don&#39;t think that it&#39;s lack of &quot;run in a web browser&quot; makes it a bad choice, no programming language besides JavaScript has any kind of ability to &quot;run in a web browser&quot; these days.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158642/can-you-run-a-java-executable-on-a-webpage/58158833#58158833","title":"Can you run a java executable on a webpage?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":154988,"user_id":418556,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOfDr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew Thompson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418556/andrew-thompson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569857550,"post_id":58158876,"comment_id":102723172,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158642/can-you-run-a-java-executable-on-a-webpage/58158876#comment102723172_58158876"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3162,"user_id":681444,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ccf4662e1bc928723d74099d0b51df24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"racraman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/681444/racraman"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569788267,"creation_date":1569788267,"answer_id":58158876,"question_id":58158642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58158876","body_markdown":"&gt; just for private testing \r\n\r\nOK, so long as you realise that applets are not just deprecated, but obsolete and would never be written today for any real application.\r\n\r\nApplets were finally fully removed in Java11 after being deprecated in Java 9, so first thing you’ll need is an older version of Java.\r\n\r\nOn the browser, applets ran by utilising the “NPAPI” (“Netscape Plug-in API”).

I tried to implement these in vain. So I&#39;m missing something probably because of my inexperience in Keras.\r\n[similar 1][1] ,\r\n[similar 2][1]\r\n\r\n**The problem:**\r\nI have a data generator to feed data into various models to evaluate model performance and to learn Keras. \r\n\r\n    model.fit_generator(generator=img_gen.next_train(), ....\r\n\r\nOne of the inputs produced by this generator is a tensor &quot;labels&quot; of shape=[batch_size, num_letters]. This tensor is the first input to \r\n\r\n    K.ctc_batch_cost(labels, .... \r\n\r\n \r\nsimilar to [image_ocr.py][2] line 369.\r\n\r\nThe above &quot;keras example&quot; creates an RNN/GRU where each output step of the RNN is one input to the ctc, where there are num_letters steps in the RNN and the labels is of shape (?, num_letters). This worked fine for the first 6 models I have tested so far.\r\n\r\nI am testing a new model where each step of the RNN/GRU output is &quot;1 to n&quot; inputs to the ctc and leaving it to training to optimize the output of each step.  So my ctc needs as it&#39;s first input  a tensor of shape=(?,num_letters*n) but the data generator produces shape=(?, num_letters).\r\n\r\nSide note: The RNN in my model actually produce as a whole shape=(?, n, num_letters).  I know how to convert this to (?, n*num_letters).\r\n\r\n**Solution 1** is a hack, change the generator so that it&#39;s unique for this model being tested. This generator will produce tensors of shape=(?,num_letters*n).  I don&#39;t like this because the generator is also being evaluated and would like it to be constant for each model being evaluated.\r\n\r\n**Solution 2** is a hack, create a generator that encapsulates the original generator and augments the produced output.\r\n\r\n**Solution 3:** have the model take an input of shape=(?, num_letters) and concatenate the necessary padding so the shape is (?,num_letters*n) that the ctc wants.\r\n\r\n**Here is what I tried:**\r\n\r\n    num_letters = 3\r\n    n = 5\r\n    \r\n    keras_tensor_input = keras.layers.Input( shape=[num_letters], dtype=&#39;float32&#39; )\r\n    print(&quot;keras_tensor_input = &quot;, keras_tensor_input)\r\n    # keras_tensor_input =  Tensor(&quot;input_1:0&quot;, shape=(?, 3), dtype=float32)\r\n    # note ? is batch size\r\n    \r\n    keras_tensor_neg_1 = keras.backend.constant( -1, dtype=&#39;float32&#39;, shape=[num_letters] )\r\n    print(&quot;keras_tensor_neg_1 = &quot;, keras_tensor_neg_1)\r\n    # keras_tensor_neg_1 =  Tensor(&quot;Const_1:0&quot;, shape=(3,), dtype=float32)\r\n    # note no batch size\r\n    \r\n    keras_tensor_neg_1_tiled = keras.backend.tile(keras_tensor_neg_1, (n-1))\r\n    print(&quot;keras_tensor_neg_1_tiled = &quot;, keras_tensor_neg_1_tiled)\r\n    # keras_tensor_neg_1_tiled =  Tensor(&quot;Tile_2:0&quot;, shape=(12,), dtype=float32)\r\n    # note no batch size, but now the correct fill length\r\n    \r\n    # FAILED attempt to put in a batch size\r\n\r\n    layer_const_neg_1 = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: keras_tensor_neg_1_tiled ,output_shape=[(n-1)*num_letters] )\r\n    keras_tensor_neg_1_prime = layer_const_neg_1(keras_tensor_neg_1)\r\n    print(&quot;keras_tensor_neg_1_prime = &quot;, keras_tensor_neg_1_prime)\r\n    # keras_tensor_neg_1_prime =  Tensor(&quot;Tile_2:0&quot;, shape=(12,), dtype=float32)\r\n    \r\n    # CRASH AT NEXT STEP BECAUSE NO ? in keras_tensor_neg_1_prime\r\n    \r\n    # concatenate the input from the generator and the padding\r\n    keras_tensor_concat = keras.layers.Concatenate()( inputs = [keras_tensor_input, keras_tensor_neg_1_prime] )\r\n    print(&quot;keras_tensor_concat = &quot;, keras_tensor_concat)\r\n    \r\n    my_model = keras.models.Model( inputs=[keras_tensor_input], output=keras_tensor_concat)\r\n    \r\n    # dummy optimizer, loss, and metric just to allow compile to pass\r\n    my_model.compile(optimizer=&#39;rmsprop&#39;,loss=&#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;, metrics=[&#39;accuracy&#39;])\r\n    \r\n    # a batch of size 1, for a tensor of shape =[3]\r\n    d1 = numpy.array([[1, 2, 3]])\r\n    \r\n    out = my_model.predict( [ d1 ] )\r\n    print(out)\r\n\r\n**Notes:**\r\n\r\n 1. could have made constant shape=[num_letters*(n-1)] and drop the tile, but the same problem of missing batch size remains.\r\n 2. if I place batch_size as first dimensions, then it still fails complaining of (?, 3) can not be concatenated with (1, 12)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50254513/concatenate-input-with-constant-vector-in-keras-how-one-define-the-batch-size\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/image_ocr.py","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158620/concatenate-input-tensor-with-multiple-of-neg-1-tensors","title":"Concatenate input tensor with multiple of neg 1 tensors"},{"tags":["django"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12139789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e0d8cd414672211091e281ae4bed9e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abarrero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139789/abarrero"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569788254,"post_id":58158616,"comment_id":102700077,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158616/reverse-for-detail-with-arguments-not-found-1-patterns-tried-pol#comment102700077_58158616"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12139789,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e0d8cd414672211091e281ae4bed9e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Abarrero","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139789/abarrero"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3504,"user_id":10746224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25bb2589e5ce6b9bd2c2fa2d81961c95?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Caleb Goodman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10746224/caleb-goodman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569787007,"creation_date":1569786259,"last_edit_date":1569787007,"question_id":58158616,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158616","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been all day struggling with this issue in my starting Django Course.

Install `boost` and `boost-devel`\r\n\r\n    sudo yum install boost # installs the libraries for linking\r\n    sudo yum install boost-devel # installs the header files for you to include for compilation\r\n\r\n2.  The command you&#39;re trying to get Eclipse to produce is the following:\r\n\r\n    g++ net-server.cpp -I /usr/include -L/usr/lib64/ -lboost_system\r\n\r\nThe `-L/usr/lib64` is actually unnecessary, but I include it for the reader, since it allows the reader more easily understand the relationship between the `-l` inclusion and the `-L/usr/lib64` that&#39;s by default included in Oracle Linux (probably RHEL too).\r\n\r\nThe `-I /usr/include` is also unnecessary, but it&#39;s included to make it clear to the reader where the `boost/array.hpp` etc. files are coming from for the compilation phase.\r\n\r\n3.  To get Eclipse to produce that command\r\n\r\n- Go to project &gt; properties\r\n- Choose the build you wish to configure (you&#39;ll probably want to do it for both the &quot;Debug&quot; and &quot;Release&quot; builds, but maybe you just have one)\r\n- Go to the &quot;Cross G++ Linker&quot; &gt; Libraries.\r\n- In the Libraries section, click on the `+` icon and add the `boost_system` library.\r\n\r\nHeads up that I chose the &quot;cross gcc compilation&quot; option instead of the Linux cross-compile option.  This is actually from within Nvidia&#39;s version of Eclipse (distributed with CUDA as &quot;Eclipse Nsight&quot;), so the instructions for the non-Nvidia version of Eclipse may vary a bit.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58158609/how-to-compile-and-link-boost-libraries-within-eclipse-on-oracle-linux/58158610#58158610","title":"How to compile and link boost libraries within Eclipse on Oracle Linux"}],"owner":{"reputation":1264,"user_id":3738356,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":32,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e17701b63957cb2224001256ad355f6b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ragerdl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3738356/ragerdl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569786201,"creation_date":1569786201,"question_id":58158609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58158609","body_markdown":"Having trouble figuring out how to compile and link a simple boost program that just includes some boost libraries.\r\n\r\nThe code is as follows\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;boost/array.hpp&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;boost/asio.hpp&gt;\r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    int main() {\r\n    \tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;!!!Hello World!!!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl; // prints !!!Hello World!!!\r\n    \treturn 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNote to the moderators: there are a lot of posts on SO asking similar questions.
