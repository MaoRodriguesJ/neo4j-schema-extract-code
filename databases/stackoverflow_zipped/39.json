Read the input data into memory in a format that can be manipulated easily.\r\n 2. Manipulate the data in memory\r\n 3. Output the results in the desired format.\r\n\r\nWhen reading the data into memory, you might decide to read all the data in one go before manipulating it. Or you might decide to read the input data one line at a time and manipulate each line as it is read. When using shell scripting languages, like bash, the second option usually results in simpler code.\r\n\r\nThe most important decision to make here is how you want to structure the data in memory. You normally want to avoid duplication of data, and you usually want a data structure that is easy to transform into your desired output. In this case, the most logical data structure is an associative array, using the team name as the key.\r\n\r\nAssuming that you have to use bash, here is a framework for you to build upon:\r\n\r\n

each team saving in there their results? and then how do i implement the rankings, for example \r\n\r\n - team1 3p\r\n - team2 1p\r\n - etc.\r\n\r\nim not asking for actual code, just a guide as to how i should implement it. is making a new file the right move? should i try making a new array with the teams instead? or something else?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523932/how-can-i-save-in-a-list-array-first-parts-of-a-line-and-then-sort-them-dependin","title":"How can i save in a list/array first parts of a

am building a REST API server that handles POST requests. The content type in the request is &quot;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&quot;.In the request body, we are sending &quot;data1&quot; (some string) and &quot;image&quot; ( a file)\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the sample inputForm code I have:\r\n\r\n    from django import forms\r\n    \r\n    class RequestForm(forms.Form):\r\n        data1= forms.CharField(label=&#39;data1&#39;,max_length=10000)\r\n        image = forms.ImageField()\r\n\r\n\r\nI then validate the content in the form request:\r\n\r\n    if request.method == &#39;POST&#39;:\r\n            form = RequestForm(request.POST)\r\n            print(&quot;Form content: {0}&quot;.format(form))\r\n            if form.is_valid():\r\n                print(&quot;Works&quot;)\r\n            else:\r\n                print(&quot;Issue&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when I send the above mentioned data, I always get an error. It prints &quot;Issue&quot;. In addition, the line taht prints form content shows it as an error.

have:\r\n```\r\nif ($youtube[$i] == 0){\r\n\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut POST vars are all strings. Change to:\r\n```\r\nif ($youtube[$i] == &quot;0&quot;){\r\n\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn otherwords, an equality on a string to numerical 0 will be true in your cases. And thus your `else` never executes.\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Edit. PROOF\r\n\r\n```\r\n$test1 = &quot;filename.dat&quot;;\r\n$test2 = &quot;2939&quot;;\r\n$test3 = &quot;some useful data&quot;;\r\n$test4 = &quot;0&quot;;\r\n\r\nif ($test1 == 0) {\r\n    // Dont do anything\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    echo &quot;Do Work 1.&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif ($test2 == 0) {\r\n    // Dont do anything\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    echo &quot;Do Work 2.&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif ($test3 == 0) {\r\n    // Dont do anything\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    echo &quot;Do Work 3.&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif ($test4 == 0) {\r\n    // Dont do anything\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    echo &quot;Do Work 4.&quot;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly echoes out `Do Work 2.`. All other `echo()`s are not run because the equality of a string to a number 0 will return `true` except in those cases where the string also is numerical, and then the interpreter will compare the numerical values.\r\n\r\nAs how this relates to the OP&#39;s question: It can be inferred that the OP&#39;s POST vars must contain some non-numerical data because the OP insists that the 3rd array is populated:\r\n\r\n&gt; But the third loop is not executed and there are real values on the variables inside the third array.\r\n\r\nI will add likely the loop is executed, but not giving the expected the results due the reasons so mentioned.\r\n\r\nTested on PHP 5 and 7.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523904/loop-from-array-not-executed/58524446#58524446","title":"Loop from array not executed"}],"owner":{"reputation":2111,"user_id":2665223,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wa6Sc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mvasco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2665223/mvasco"},"last_editor":{"reputation":81528,"user_id":1415724,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zErhj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Funk Forty Niner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1415724/funk-forty-niner"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":71,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58524446,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571842745,"creation_date":1571837026,"last_edit_date":1571837296,"question_id":58523904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523904","body_markdown":"I am working on an android app that should create some records on a MySQL database.\r\n\r\nThis is the PHP file that receives the POST values from the app.\r\nAs you may see, there are three arrays that collect specific POST. \r\nThe first and second loops are working fine and executing the related guardar_post_media() function.\r\n\r\nBut the third loop is not executed and there are real values on the variables inside the third array.\r\n\r\nMay be there is something wrong that I can&#180;t detect, may be you can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n            require_once &#39;../mis_php_functions/funciones_basicas.php&#39;;\r\n         \r\n            if($_SERVER[&#39;REQUEST_METHOD&#39;]==&#39;POST&#39;){\r\n                \r\n                $val39 = $_POST[&#39;val39&#39;];

Should I worry about any more details?\r\n\r\nEach client/user of the system is located in a region with different time, so I put in the model the record that identifies the region:\r\n\r\nIn model:\r\n```python\r\nTIMEZONES = tuple(zip(pytz.all_timezones, pytz.all_timezones))\r\ntimezone = models.CharField (\r\n    null = False,\r\n    blank = False,\r\n    max_length = 32,\r\n    choices = TIMEZONES,\r\n    default = &#39;UTC&#39;,\r\n    verbose_name = &quot;timezone&quot;,\r\n    help_text = &quot;Timezone&quot;\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the user logs in, the settings.py TIME_ZONE variable changes according to the logged-in user&#39;s timezone:\r\n\r\nAt login:\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.conf import settings\r\nsettings.TIME_ZONE = timezone\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I do a cursor query, I timezone as it is in settings.py:\r\n\r\nIn the query:\r\n```python\r\nfrom django.conf import settings\r\ntimezone = settings.TIME_ZONE\r\nquery = &quot;&quot; &quot;\r\n    SET TIMEZONE = &#39;{}&#39;;\r\n    ...\r\n&quot;&quot; &quot;.format (timezone)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn templates, I enable timezone:\r\n\r\nIn the templates:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n{% load tz%}\r\n...\r\n{% localtime on%}\r\n...\r\n{% endlocaltime%}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI hope I was clear in the presentation above.

can achieve this by using implicit conversion operators. These basically allow you to define a conversion from one Type to another and back. These conversions can either be explicit, so you&#39;ll need to explicitly cast them every time, or they can be implicit, so it just does it. Here&#39;s an example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic class Iban\r\n{\r\n    private readonly string _ibanString;\r\n\r\n    public Iban(string iban)\r\n    {\r\n        _ibanString = iban;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static implicit operator Iban(string iban) =&gt; new Iban(iban);\r\n   \r\n    public static implicit operator string(Iban iban) =&gt; iban._ibanString;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now do this:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nIban iban = &quot;SOME IBAN&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nA quick breakdown of the implicit/ explicit operator syntax and a link to the MSDN documentation:\r\n\r\nBasically, a operator must always be `public static` followed by either the `implicit` or `explicit` keyword, then follows the type which will be returned (much like for a method), and then finally you can specify exactly one argument to use to convert from. After that you can either do like I did and use the expression body syntax from a method or use an actual body with `{ ... return foo; }` and all.\r\n\r\nAnd here is the promised MSDN link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/user-defined-conversion-operators\r\n\r\n**Note 1:** I just re read your title and you were asking for a value type, it&#39;s just as easy. All you need to do is replace `public class Iban` with `public struct Iban`.\r\n\r\n**Note 2:** When you have implicitly defined operators on a class you can use explicit casting, but when you only have explicitly defined operators on a class you cannot implicitly cast them. So with implicit operators this is perfectly legal:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nvar iban = (Iban) &quot;SOME IBAN&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when you have explicit operators the following becomes illegal and you&#39;ll have to explicitly cast it:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n// Throws a compiler error\r\nIban iban = &quot;SOME IBAN&quot;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523890/is-it-possible-in-c-to-create-a-very-simple-value-type-for-iban-bic/58524046#58524046","title":"Is it possible in C# to create a very simple value type for IBAN, BIC?"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":8226049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-3SUFr9ieZOE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANQ/oaVL5WlP3tM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"grafbumsdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8226049/grafbumsdi"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58524046,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571839200,"creation_date":1571836983,"question_id":58523890,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523890","body_markdown":"Is it possible in C# to create a very simple value type for IBAN, BIC (maybe with `struct`)?

However, it did not work well in **Excel for Windows**: when we clicked to tigger a router event, e.g. clicking on docusaurus&#39; sidebar, there was a error, the router had no effect, and the sidebar did not work well (see [Screenshot](http://static.zybuluo.com/BurdenBear/n6jcgubwpsyo0rstkf4vitl3/image.png)).\r\n\r\nI managed to fix this error by adding the loading of `history.js`:\r\n```html\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n  &lt;head&gt;\r\n    ... ...\r\n    &lt;script\r\n      type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\r\n      src=&quot;https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/1/hosted/office.js&quot;\r\n      onload=&quot;onOfficejsLoad();&quot;\r\n    &gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script\r\n      nomodule\r\n      type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;\r\n      src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/html5-history-api/4.2.10/history.js&quot;\r\n    &gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n  &lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI still post the question, because I don&#39;t understand why the previous version did work our in add-in in Excel Online IE 11, but not in Excel for Windows, shouldn&#39;t their behaviors the same? Most importantly, when developing Excel add-ins, is there any **best practice** to follow to manage the conflit of `history.pushState` and office.js?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523883/whats-the-best-practice-to-fix-history-pushstate-which-is-deleted-by-office-js","title":"What&#39;s the best practice to fix history.pushState which is deleted by office.js?"},{"tags":["r","shiny"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":8064072,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/701772b5edac341abc3dcbc4c4f64820?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"laurenzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8064072/laurenzo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571869318,"creation_date":1571869318,"answer_id":58531697,"question_id":58523881,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58531697","body_markdown":"Found the answer here:\r\n\r\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/shiny-discuss/SCLzc8nKotM\r\n\r\nI have to specify search, label and valueField in order to make selectize work.

Any suggestions would really be appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere is what I have achieved so far:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHere is what I want to achieve:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nHere is the image of the peice of frame I am using:\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5acyK.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/s0FMu.jpg\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0SGc2.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523839/render-a-picture-frame-in-a-canvas-element","title":"Render a picture frame in a canvas element"},{"tags":["ampl","magic-square","operations-research"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12248690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCavfOP1sM8IYDbXP9_jd5uGFpX0pktxddFKEoG4p0=k-s128","display_name":"Matteo D&#39;Alessio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12248690/matteo-dalessio"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12248690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCavfOP1sM8IYDbXP9_jd5uGFpX0pktxddFKEoG4p0=k-s128","display_name":"Matteo D&#39;Alessio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12248690/matteo-dalessio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571840622,"creation_date":1571836774,"last_edit_date":1571840622,"question_id":58523835,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523835","body_markdown":"The constraints of my model are that the sum of the elements on the lines must be equal to a constant (var constant), that the sum of the elements on the columns must be equal to the same constant and that also the sum on the diagonals must be equal to the same constant .

After restarting the wildfly server I am able to deploy or ready for deployment or my war file deployed successfully on server.\r\n\r\nHence I want to know why I am facing this type of issue if I have a better configuration?\r\nHow can fix this?\r\nHow can I avoid this type of issue?\r\nIs wildfly server updation is the solution then Why I am facing the same issue in wildfly server 17?\r\n\r\nThank Prasad.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523826/wildfly-server-10-memory-leak-on-deployment-or-undeployment","title":"Wildfly server 10 Memory leak on deployment or undeployment"},{"tags":["angular","ag-grid"],"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":10800899,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-rEmLUUIhjII/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-gWkWtuwQ3hPIk-YkHLOw7QKcYWQw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bogdan B","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10800899/bogdan-b"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571836745,"creation_date":1571836745,"question_id":58523824,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523824","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using a frameworkComponent inside Ag-Grid and when i try to focus that component using the gridApi&#39;s `setFocusedCell` i get the following log in the console `ag-Grid-angular: could not find EventEmitter: popupToFront` .\r\nIt&#39;s not an error, it&#39;s just a console log.

Therefore the structure of the data sets will be defined as:\r\n\r\nColumns:\r\n\r\n- Player ID\r\n- Campaign ID\r\n- Player Group: Target or Contol\r\n- Rest of the columns: Combinations of a KPI and a given period of time.\r\n\r\nThe objective is to calculate the SD and SUMSQ of a subset of data based on the following restrictions: the KPI, the period of time, the Campaign ID and the Group of the player. As the dataset is built, the conditions &quot;KPI&quot; and &quot;Period&quot; will determine the column from which the data is going to be taken and the conditions &quot;Campaign&quot; and &quot;Player Group&quot; will act as row filters.\r\n\r\nI have tried the following... with little hope, since I don&#39;t even expect that an array formula can be nested in an &quot;if&quot; function:\r\n```\r\n=IF(AND(Test!$J$9=&quot;STAKES&quot;,Test!$M$9=7),STDEV.S(IF(DATA!$A$2:$A$9237=Test!$B$13,DATA!$AD$2:$AD$9237,0)))\r\n```\r\nCan someone come up with a solution, please?\r\n\r\n[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/R2ciX.png\r\n \r\n    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523822/excel-formula-to-calculate-sd-and-sumsq-based-on-4-conditions-2-of-the-conditio","title":"Excel Formula to calculate SD and SUMSQ based on 4 conditions. 2 of the conditions will determine from which column the data will be taken from"},{"tags":["c++","visual-studio","visual-c++","build","msvc12"],"owner":{"reputation":835,"user_id":434537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BMsE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"rolls","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/434537/rolls"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":4,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571836736,"creation_date":1571836736,"question_id":58523819,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523819","body_markdown":"If I create a visual studio 2019 C++ project.

am trying to build a molecule data structure. Starting with an `Atom` struct, a molecule `Vec` stores all of the `Atom`s (with their coordinates and indices, etc). I also want a `Bond` struct which will have pairs of `Atom` structs, and another `Vec` which stores all of the bonds. I&#39;ll do the same for `Angle` and so on...\r\n\r\nOnce in the structs, the data will not be mutated, it will just be used to calculate things like bond lengths via methods, but I can&#39;t quite work out how to get around the ownership issue.\r\n\r\n`mvp_molecule.rs`\r\n\r\n```rust\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nstruct Atom {\r\n    atomic_symbol: String,\r\n    index: i16,\r\n}\r\n\r\n#[derive(Debug)]\r\nstruct Bond {\r\n    atom_1: Atom,\r\n    atom_2: Atom,\r\n}\r\n\r\npub fn make_molecule() {\r\n    let mut molecule = Vec::new();\r\n    let mut bonds = Vec::new();\r\n\r\n    let atom_1 = Atom {\r\n        atomic_symbol: &quot;C&quot;.to_string(),\r\n        index: 0,\r\n    };\r\n    molecule.push(atom_1);\r\n    let atom_2 = Atom {\r\n        atomic_symbol: &quot;H&quot;.to_string(),\r\n        index: 1,\r\n    };\r\n    molecule.push(atom_2);\r\n    let bond = Bond {\r\n        atom_1: molecule[0],\r\n        atom_2: molecule[1],\r\n    };\r\n    bonds.push(bond);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the issue is that Rust thinks I might change an `Atom` while it&#39;s in a `Bond`, which I won&#39;t do. How can I convince Rust of that?\r\n\r\nI appreciate this may be a common problem but I&#39;m not learned enough to realise what I should be looking for to solve it. I&#39;ve looked through a lot of the documentation on references, borrowing and lifetimes but I&#39;m still not quite sure what the issue I&#39;m trying to solve is, or if it&#39;s solvable in this way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523797/vec-of-structs-causing-borrowing-issues","title":"Vec of structs causing borrowing issues"},{"tags":["python","pycharm","imaplib"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":5417511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d1f8a0e0d12727fff7d97d2f1734700?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"luigigi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5417511/luigigi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571836834,"post_id":58523795,"comment_id":103372667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma#comment103372667_58523795"},{"owner":{"reputation":3017,"user_id":5086255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eqJ9a.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"temmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5086255/temmo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571836884,"post_id":58523795,"comment_id":103372696,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma#comment103372696_58523795"},{"owner":{"reputation":286,"user_id":10349423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8d259ac7b029407015952422841729a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yoel Nisanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10349423/yoel-nisanov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571836946,"post_id":58523795,"comment_id":103372732,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma#comment103372732_58523795"},{"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":11796720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fe2c3f1bc463738af3393207efacc50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pablo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11796720/pablo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571837797,"post_id":58523795,"comment_id":103373232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma#comment103373232_58523795"},{"owner":{"reputation":1691,"user_id":9173379,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/924cf387d6ee0d0822f45ec5f797dc6b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.Schalk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9173379/m-schalk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841279,"post_id":58523795,"comment_id":103375375,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma#comment103375375_58523795"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1691,"user_id":9173379,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/924cf387d6ee0d0822f45ec5f797dc6b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M.Schalk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9173379/m-schalk"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841151,"post_id":58523863,"comment_id":103375287,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma/58523863#comment103375287_58523863"},{"owner":{"reputation":8098,"user_id":1442918,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7490251da02084a2e2720e20029d2bff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1442918/max"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571864961,"post_id":58523863,"comment_id":103385857,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523795/code-runs-fine-in-pycharm-returns-attributeerror-when-executed-from-the-comma/58523863#comment103385857_58523863"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":166568,"user_id":17160,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81cb50f5fe868629a680c16a56781f01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"nosklo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/17160/nosklo"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571836881,"creation_date":1571836881,"answer_id":58523863,"question_id":58523795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58523863","body_markdown":"It seems you have a file named `imaplib.py` at the current directory.

This map editor has a tileset (a `QLabel` on which you can select a tile by clicking on it), and of course a map. Now, I&#39;m not really sure about how to deal with the map. Ideally, I&#39;d want a widget that I can click on, draw a tile at a specified position on this map, etc. This wouldn&#39;t be *drag &amp; drop* style , just simply clicking on the map would paste the selected tile. \r\n\r\nI was wondering what is the best widget for my case? I wanted to go with a widget to which I would assign a `mousePressEvent` (like I did with the tileset for the tile selection), but the `QPainter` doesn&#39;t allow this. Is it possible to draw on a `QLabel`? One thing to keep in mind is that the map data will be stored as an array in the end, so this is purely for display purpose (no need to save it or whatever).  \r\n\r\nCheers!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523753/map-editor-in-pyqt5-which-widget-for-drawing-a-map-by-adding-tiles-qpainter-q","title":"Map editor in PyQt5: which widget for drawing a map by adding tiles (QPainter, Qlabel, another one)?"},{"tags":["liquibase","corda"],"owner":{"reputation":1604,"user_id":1967189,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/052101b1d29af6dec6ad49cc52cd538b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andranik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1967189/andranik"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571836519,"creation_date":1571836519,"question_id":58523752,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523752","body_markdown":"I switched to Corda Enterprise mainly to try how it handles automated database migration.\r\nIn the documentation [here][1] it says `tools-database-manager` generates only SQL version of Liquibase script for initial DB and SQL version is Database specific so should not be used for production.\r\n\r\nBut it is possible to generate the XML also with liqubase cmd using this command:\r\n`/snap/bin/liquibase --url=&quot;jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:10039/node&quot; --driver=org.h2.Driver --classpath=/home/corda/Downloads/h2.jar generateChangeLog`\r\n\r\nwhich I did, and then I had to remove all the chnagelogs which are related to corda internal tables, and left only the ones that are my own and it seems everything works.\r\n\r\nSo the question is - may this approach have some hidden dangers that I don&#39;t know.

Essentially the idea is to invoke simple REST API call and passing your payload in the request body:\r\n    \r\n    [string]$Endpoint= &quot;https://myfunction.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger?code=my_code_I_get_from_Azure_portal&quot;\r\n    . . .\r\n    $payload =@&quot; your payload &quot;@\r\n    $Header = @{\r\n       &quot;Content-Type&quot; = &quot;text/plain&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n    $Result = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Endpoint -Method Post -body $Payload Headers $Header\r\n\r\nAzure function URL+Code you get from Azure portal, if you click on Azure Function, you will see the button &#39;Get Function Url&#39;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523746/saving-powershell-object-csv-string-as-a-file-to-azure-blob-storage/58524320#58524320","title":"Saving Powershell Object CSV String as a file to Azure Blob Storage"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":11336985,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cc686c468dbe5c524b729ecf1fd88604?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user42012","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11336985/user42012"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571861427,"creation_date":1571836510,"question_id":58523746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523746","body_markdown":"We are generating a Powershell object thru Azure Runbook and basically converting it into a CSV string.\r\n\r\nWe want to store this generated CSV String (generated from Azure Powershell Runbook) into Azure Blob Storage as a CSV File.\r\nCan someone help me how and whcih powershell command we can use to save this CSV String as File to Azure Blob Storage?\r\nI tried to look around and came across Push-OutputBindings function but not sure how I can use that one in Azure Powershell Runbook which module to import and not sure if it is part of Azure Functions V2 but any little basics on how I can use it will help me.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523746/saving-powershell-object-csv-string-as-a-file-to-azure-blob-storage","title":"Saving Powershell Object CSV String as a file to Azure Blob Storage"},{"tags":["ocaml"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":3158810,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ebf9e065f654642fecfee399b439030?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"G4143","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3158810/g4143"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571837538,"post_id":58523744,"comment_id":103373089,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523744/ocaml-new-keyword#comment103373089_58523744"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4790,"user_id":3210257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e031a73b4d825b34b8fbcdae03b76f0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"PatJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3210257/patj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571842014,"creation_date":1571842014,"answer_id":58525520,"question_id":58523744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58525520","body_markdown":"You are right, `Lwt_engine.libev` is a class.

How this HTTPS stuff is handled in Charles or other proxies?\r\n\r\nTechnically, Charles Proxy or [Proxyman.io][1] (the one I&#39;m using now) would do the following steps:\r\n \r\n- Generate a root certificate and install to keychain and trust it. This steps would do once.\r\n- Open the Local Server (at 8888 or 9090).\r\n- Override the HTTP Proxy in System to this port. Thus, all traffic will go through the port. You could use the `networksetup` CLI to easily achieve or Privileged Helper tool on macOS for high performance and secure.\r\n- As soon as capture the first socket: If It&#39;s a HTTP request, get a first line message. Ex:\r\n```\r\nGET https://api.producthunt.com/v1/posts HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n- Then open the forward socket to this URL.\r\n- If it&#39;s a HTTPS, make sure do SSL-Handshake and then get the first line message.\r\n- Finally, just get the rest of message and parse to proper message([HTTPCParser][2] from NodeJS would be potential candidate)\r\n- Send data forward and back from the client and the destination server.\r\n- Do manipulation actions if you need since you&#39;re the true mitm.\r\n\r\n&gt; 2. Will I need self-signed root certification mobile device? \r\n\r\nYes, you must install the Root Certificate in the first steps to your iOS device. For the Header/Response detail. Check chls.pro/ssl or proxy.man/ssl from those Charles or Proxyman, and see the content.\r\n\r\nYou can do it on iOS Simulator by using [ADVTrustStore][3]\r\n\r\n&gt; 3.

This works for the &#39;rows&#39; of a container/table but the same logic cannot be applied to the &#39;total&#39; which is in a separate container/table. \r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why I am trying to solve the problem with the total using the script editor of NPrinting Designer.\r\n\r\nQlik has created a video where they demonstrate how you can output a table with top 10 rows using the following C#

true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI am not an expert in C# code at all but I have tried to use the same logic to achieve the conditional coloring of the total row:\r\n\r\n    using System.Drawing.Printing;\r\n    \r\n    //C# code for printing conditional coloring/colorting based on values \r\n    \r\n    Color redColor = Color.FromArgb(255, 0, 0);\r\n    Color greenColor = Color.FromArgb(0, 255, 0);\r\n

pseudo-code:\r\n\r\nAround 100 reports (imagine one for each region of a country).\r\n\r\nWhen total &gt; 0 Then color background of that container red\r\n\r\nElse color background of that container green.\r\n\r\nWhen I validate the code in the script editor of NPrinting Designer I get the following error:\r\n\r\n    The type or namespace name &#39;ColorEventArgs&#39; could not be found (are you using a directive or an assembly reference?)\r\n\r\nThe error message probably makes sense but again as I am not familiar with C# and just using this as my last option I would like to know how I can move on from here.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523729/how-to-change-background-color-of-a-cell-group-in-a-pixel-report-in-nprinting-de","title":"How to

For the `Employee` class you would need two collections, one for each relationship. Additionally, you&#39;ll need to use the `InverseProperty` attribute to tell EF which foreign key goes with which collection:\r\n\r\n    public class Employee\r\n    {\r\n        ...\r\n\r\n        [InverseProperty(nameof(Task.RequestedBy))]\r\n        public ICollection&lt;Task&gt; RequestedTasks { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        [InverseProperty(nameof(Task.TaskedTo))]\r\n        public ICollection&lt;Task&gt; AssignedTasks { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou don&#39;t need `virtual`. That&#39;s to enable lazy-loading. For the lazy-loading functionality, EF creates a dynamic proxy class that inherits from your entity and overrides the getter on the navigation property. The `virtual` keyword is required in C# to allow a class member to be overridden.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `Owned` attribute is for value objects. It&#39;s a way of having a related class whose properties are literally mapped onto the same table or if given its own table, inherently tied to the entity that &quot;owns&quot; it, such that you access that data *through* the entity, not separately. Neither of which applies here.\r\n\r\nFinally, you should reconsider the name `Task` for this class. .NET already has a `Task` class, and it&#39;s used very frequently. If you name your class `Task` as well, you&#39;ll be having to specify namespaces virtually every time you use either one, which is a pain.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58523723/ef-core-defining-complex-relation/58524150#58524150","title":"EF Core defining &quot;complex&quot; relation"}],"owner":{"reputation":1297,"user_id":5992977,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/892ffc20f5aaedc230b6e1bead8d9d56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yossi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5992977/yossi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58524150,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571840331,"creation_date":1571836447,"last_edit_date":1571840331,"question_id":58523723,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58523723","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having a hard time defining the relations I want using EF Core(1 to many) .\r\n\r\nE.G:\r\n\r\nI am an entity of `Task` and `Employee` , each task is given by an employee and also is appointed to an employee .
