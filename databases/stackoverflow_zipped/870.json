For example, if you input gross pay &quot;**100,50**&quot; you input comma but you need to input point: &quot;**100.50**&quot;. If you input comma than gross pay is set to 100 and &quot;**,50**&quot; left in the std::cin stream. &quot;**,50**&quot; can not be converted to double in the next input (**cin &gt;&gt; federalTax;**). As result, federalTax is not changed (if you use **c++03**) or set to 0 (if you use **c++11**). Details are in the [article][1]. So, (for c++03) each place where you input data (std::cin) does not change corresponding variable, &quot;**,50**&quot; is still in input stream (so, no waiting of the next user input), and at the end of each loop employeeNumber also is not changed, and than condition of **while (employeeNumber != 0)** of course is **true**, where an endless loop is formed.

How can i solve this? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        import UIKit\r\n\r\n        class ViewController: UIViewController {\r\n    \r\n            var cellIds = [&quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;3&quot;]\r\n    \r\n                @IBOutlet weak var collectionView: UICollectionView!\r\n              fileprivate var longPressGesture =  UILongPressGestureRecognizer();\r\n   \r\n            let cellSizes = [\r\n                CGSize(width:190, height:200),\r\n                 CGSize(width:190, height:200),\r\n                  CGSize(width:190, height:200),\r\n\r\n            ]\r\n    \r\n            @objc func longTap(_ gesture: UIGestureRecognizer){\r\n        \r\n                switch(gesture.state) {\r\n                case .began:\r\n                    guard let selectedIndexPath = collectionView.indexPathForItem(at: gesture.location(in: collectionView)) else {\r\n                        return\r\n                    }\r\n                    collectionView.beginInteractiveMovementForItem(at: selectedIndexPath)\r\n                case .changed:\r\n                    collectionView.updateInteractiveMovementTargetPosition(gesture.location(in: gesture.view!))\r\n                case .ended:\r\n                    collectionView.endInteractiveMovement()\r\n                    //doneBtn.isHidden = false\r\n                    //longPressedEnabled = true\r\n                    self.collectionView.reloadData()\r\n                default:\r\n                    collectionView.cancelInteractiveMovement()\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            override func viewDidLoad() {\r\n                super.viewDidLoad()\r\n\r\n        \r\n                longPressGesture = UILongPressGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(self.longTap(_:)))\r\n                collectionView.addGestureRecognizer(longPressGesture)\r\n        \r\n  \r\n                collectionView!.register(UICustomCollectionViewCell.self, forCellWithReuseIdentifier: &quot;MenuCell&quot;)\r\n     \r\n                self.automaticallyAdjustsScrollViewInsets = false\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, layout collectionViewLayout: UICollectionViewLayout, insetForSectionAt section: Int) -&gt; UIEdgeInsets {\r\n                //top, left, bottom, right\r\n                return UIEdgeInsets(top: 130, left: 1, bottom: 0, right: 10)\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n        }\r\n\r\n        extension ViewController: UICollectionViewDelegate {\r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, didSelectItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n               // print(&quot;User tapped on \\(cellIds[indexPath.row])&quot;)\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, canMoveItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; Bool {\r\n                return true\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n\r\n             func userDidEndDragging(_ cell: UICollectionViewCell?) {\r\n          \r\n        \r\n             }\r\n     \r\n\r\n    \r\n    \r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, moveItemAt sourceIndexPath: IndexPath, to destinationIndexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n                let item = cellIds.remove(at: sourceIndexPath.item)\r\n                cellIds.insert(item, at: destinationIndexPath.item)\r\n                print(cellIds);\r\n            }\r\n         }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        extension ViewController: UICollectionViewDataSource {\r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, numberOfItemsInSection section: Int) -&gt; Int {\r\n                return cellIds.count\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            func collectionView(_ collectionView: UICollectionView, cellForItemAt indexPath: IndexPath) -&gt; UICollectionViewCell {\r\n                let cell = collectionView.dequeueReusableCell(withReuseIdentifier: &quot;MenuCell&quot;, for: indexPath) as?

I am using a bunch of switch statements trying to get this to work but it feels there must be a simpler way. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nThe big mistake you seem to be making here is that you&#39;re relying on the table cells to store data. Whether a given row in your table has a check mark or not should be a feature of your data model, not a setting in a table cell. You&#39;re not letting the user check certain rows because it looks nice -- the check mark should *mean* something, and that meaning should be captured in your data.\r\n\r\nI think that the reason people run into this problem is that they start the app development process by thinking about how the app should look, and so they begin by creating the user interface without giving any thought to how the data should be modeled. They store data in generic structures like an array or dictionary of dictionaries so that they can get something working quickly, and they end up with a ton of code in their view controller that tries to enforce behaviors that would come naturally if they thought in terms of business rules instead of user interface actions. Just look at the language you&#39;re using: you&#39;re talking about how many rows can be selected in which section instead of more natural rules about the data that your app is dealing with.\r\n\r\nTo solve the problem, you need to change your perspective. Stop writing UI code for a bit and focus on your data. Your goal is to build a model class that will manage all the data and rules that govern that data -- you&#39;re creating the M in MVC. Sit down and just write out the content and rules for your data. Then implement your model, and let that implementation drive the table&#39;s behavior. If you can only have one row selected in the first section of your table, it should be because your model enforces a rule like &quot;every customer has exactly one sales contact.&quot; The table view and view controller shouldn&#39;t know or care about the &quot;only one selected&quot; requirement -- it&#39;s just a feature of the model. If you select a different row in the first section, that should result in a different sales contact being selected in the model, and since the model enforces the &quot;only one&quot; rule, the model will deselect the previous sales contact. The nice thing about that is that you can then change business rules in the model -- maybe allow up to *three* sales contacts per customer -- and you don&#39;t have to do anything to the table or the view controller.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335277/uitableview-with-multiple-sections-with-multiple-rows-i-need-sections-to-behave/58336417#58336417","title":"UITableView with multiple Sections with multiple rows.

noted by [dmuir](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2564696/dmuir)\r\n\r\n&gt; You are including the fscanf in your timed sequence. This will take most of the time! It is always a good idea to time many calls of a function rather than one.\r\n\r\nBesides that, you can try a different method to evaluate the binomial coefficients:\r\n\r\n```C\r\ndouble binomial(long n, long k)\r\n{\r\n    double result = 1.0;\r\n    if ( k &gt;

i &lt;= N; i++)\r\n{       \r\n    p_value += binomial(e, i) * binomial(E - e, N - i);\r\n}\r\np_value /= binomial(E, N);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTestable [here](https://wandbox.org/permlink/Ce3AWAo1s5led53g).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335232/optimization-of-c-code-for-hypergeometric-distribution/58338550#58338550","title":"Optimization of C code for hypergeometric distribution"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":10537579,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/440c1d21e0955c7b3ad05d55080343ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ankit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10537579/ankit"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58338550,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570787119,"creation_date":1570774543,"question_id":58335232,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58335232","body_markdown":"I have to optimize the given C code :-\r\n```\r\n#include&lt;sys/time.h&gt;\r\n#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#define GAP(start, end) ((end.tv_usec-start.tv_usec)+(end.tv_sec-start.tv_sec)*1000000)\r\nvoid main(){\r\n    struct timeval start_time, end_time;\r\n    gettimeofday(&amp;start_time, NULL);\r\n    /* START OF BLOCK */\r\n    long int n, N, e, E, e_choose_i, E_e_choose_N_i, E_choose_N;\r\n    float p_value = 0;\r\n    long int i, var1, var2, var3, var4;

normally use TrustStore to trust the 3rd party Server communication. In client and server communication over HTTPS protocol, the latter always lookup its keystore and present `the public key and certificate` to the prior. After that, the client looks up the `associated certificate in the truststore`. If the certificate or the Certificate Authorities shared by the calling server is not present in the client-side trust store(**By default, Java always bundles a truststore as cacerts and keeps it&#39;s in $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security path**) then `SSLHandshakeException` will occur. To resolve the problem you have to add the trust store.\r\n\r\nDefault trusted Certificate Authorities can be listed using the command \r\n```\r\nkeytool -list -keystore cacerts\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can add the trust store using the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nkeytool -import -trustcacerts -alias certAlias -file certFile -keystore trustStoreFile \r\n```\r\nby default the trustStoreFile location is $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts.

People who believe that all SSL/TLS problems are lack of validating (trusting) the server cert are like people who think that if the engine has been removed from your car it will still run great if you just put some gas (or petrol/essence/etc depending on country) in the tank. \r\n\r\nFrom your debuglog:\r\n\r\n    *** CertificateRequest\r\n    Cert Types: RSA, DSS, ECDSA\r\n    Supported Signature Algorithms: SHA256withRSA, SHA256withDSA, SHA256withECDSA, SHA384withRSA, Unknown (hash:0x5, signature:0x2), SHA384withECDSA, SHA512withRSA, Unknown (hash:0x6, signature:0x2), SHA512withECDSA, SHA1withRSA, SHA1withDSA, SHA1withECDSA\r\n    Cert Authorities:\r\n    &lt;CN=m3_external_ca_test&gt;\r\n\r\nServer requested a client certificate, aka client auth(entication) aka 2-way or mutual authentication.\r\n\r\n    Warning: no suitable certificate found - continuing without client authentication\r\n    *** Certificate chain\r\n    &lt;Empty&gt;\r\n    ***\r\n    ...\r\n    *** ECDHClientKeyExchange\r\n    \r\n    [Raw read]: length = 2\r\n    0000: 02 28                                              .(\r\n    main, READ: TLSv1.2 Alert, length = 2\r\n    main, RECV TLSv1.2 ALERT:  fatal, handshake_failure\r\n\r\nYou didn&#39;t supply one (and the related signature to prove possession). Server aborts handshake, which in general can be for many reasons but the only likely one at this point is because you didn&#39;t supply the requested cert (and signature). \r\n\r\nGo back near the top:\r\n\r\n    keyStore is : /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_121.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/security/jssecacerts\r\n    keyStore type is : jks\r\n    keyStore provider is : \r\n    init keystore\r\n    init keymanager of type SunX509\r\n\r\nNotice this section does NOT say something like this, as it would for a usable client cert:\r\n\r\n    found key for : &lt;alias&gt;\r\n    chain [0] = [ &lt;usually dozens of lines of data&gt; ]\r\n    &lt;usually chain[1], maybe chain[2] and more depending&gt;\r\n\r\nThere are two quite different kinds of certificates: **a cert that identifies _you_** (or your device etc) and you want _others_ to trust, for which you **must have the privatekey**, and a cert that identifies someone else which _you_ trust, for which you should never have the privatekey. For client auth you need the first kind, and you don&#39;t have it. (Added note: In general for your own cert you _also_ need one or sometimes more &#39;chain&#39; or &#39;intermediate&#39; cert(s), but in this case the debuglog makes clear you are using a dummy/test CA that doesn&#39;t use chain cert(s).) \r\n\r\nEither you or somebody else prepared your `jssecacerts` wrong, or else it&#39;s the wrong file to use, since it is _intended_ to contain certs for _others_, namely CAs, that you trust, which Java calls a truststore (although it&#39;s still in keystore _format_), and not certs for yourself, which is a true keystore.\r\nThe third cert listed as trusted, with `EMAILADDRESS=rchhabra@xpwallet.com`, looks like it was likely _intended_ to be a client cert, but since you don&#39;t have the privatekey it can&#39;t be used as such. Either fix that file, or if you have the client cert WITH KEY in a different file, which would be a good and commonly used approach, use that different file instead.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335199/i-am-getting-handshake-failure-while-calling-https-url-in-my-program/58339002#58339002","title":"I am getting handshake_failure while

Any one can suggest how do to it in react-native. For this whether we can use redux or any other way. if we use redux mean how can get all details from all tabs. \r\n\r\nThanks

don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible without some kind of wrapper (or reflection, but about in a moment).\r\n\r\nIn fact, lateinit is design for compatibility with DI frameworks etc. If you know that value can be uninitialized in any moment then you should use `nullable` type. \r\n\r\nSo, what about that reflection thing? `lateinit` is in fact a kind of smart wrapper that makes `nullable` value to act like `not nullable`, and instead of throwing `NullPointerException` to throw `UninitializedPropertyAccessException`. `lateinit` property at the moment of declaration in JVM is `null`, so, let&#39;s make it `null` again ;) \r\n\r\nSo...\r\n```kotlin\r\nclass MyClass {\r\n    lateinit var lateinitObject: Any\r\n\r\n    fun test() {\r\n        println(&quot;Is initialized: ${::lateinitObject.isInitialized}&quot;) // false\r\n        lateinitObject = Unit\r\n        println(&quot;Is initialized: ${::lateinitObject.isInitialized}&quot;) // true\r\n\r\n        resetField(this, &quot;lateinitObject&quot;)\r\n        println(&quot;Is initialized: ${::lateinitObject.isInitialized}&quot;) // false\r\n\r\n        lateinitObject // this will throw UninitializedPropertyAccessException\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfun resetField(target: Any, fieldName: String) {\r\n    val field = target.javaClass.getDeclaredField(fieldName)\r\n\r\n    with (field) {\r\n        isAccessible = true\r\n        set(target, null)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfun main() {\r\n    MyClass().test()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nSo, setting that field to null (and it&#39;s possible only via reflection) makes this filed uninitialized again.

They&#39;re async functions returning futures, so the the `await Future.error(false)` will throw and complete the returned future with an error in that particular error zone.\r\n\r\nThen, when the `runZoned` completes, it returns that future with an error created in a different error zone than the call. It is `await`ed (in the root zone, which is a different error zone) so `await runZoned(() async { ... }, ...)` *never completes*. The `await` waits for the future to complete, the future refuses to give the error that it completed with to the listener, so nothing happens.\r\n\r\nYou are, effectively, waiting on a future which never completes, which is why your program stops at that point.\r\n\r\nSo this is working as intended - the error never leaves the error zone it was created in, but that leaves the outer zone without any result.\r\n\r\nThe first example works because you are throwing synchronously, and not returning a future. The synchronous throw is caught immediately, and then the `runZoned` returns `null`. (That will have to change when Dart gets non-nullable types, though).\r\n\r\nIn general, it&#39;s probably a bad idea to return futures that can contain errors from a `runZoned` with an `onError` handler.

They look like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://prnt.sc/phrdsi\r\n\r\nhttps://prnt.sc/phre7j\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know how I can make the icons look clearer on the homepage footer and header?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335145/the-social-media-icons-on-my-wordpress-homepage-are-displaying-properly-using-fo","title":"The social media icons on my wordpress homepage are displaying properly using FontAwesome on OceanWP theme"},{"tags":[".net","azure-functions","azure-application-insights","azure-keyvault"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32120,"user_id":224370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPH4K.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Mercer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224370/ian-mercer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570774558,"post_id":58335144,"comment_id":103027243,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended#comment103027243_58335144"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":4302646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d2615c5d20f39742fa1b783b834aeb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4302646/ashutosh-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":32120,"user_id":224370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPH4K.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Mercer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224370/ian-mercer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570777606,"post_id":58335144,"comment_id":103028386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended#comment103028386_58335144"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32120,"user_id":224370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPH4K.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Mercer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224370/ian-mercer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570774816,"post_id":58335271,"comment_id":103027348,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended/58335271#comment103027348_58335271"},{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":4302646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d2615c5d20f39742fa1b783b834aeb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4302646/ashutosh-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570782392,"post_id":58335271,"comment_id":103030499,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended/58335271#comment103030499_58335271"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2957,"user_id":313414,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":65,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wR062.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/313414/tom-w"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570774728,"creation_date":1570774728,"answer_id":58335271,"question_id":58335144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58335271","body_markdown":"You are passing `envKey` to `KeyVaultInitializer.GetValuesFromKeyvault`, surely you&#39;d want to use the value of the setting, not the key?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended/58335271#58335271","title":"AzureFunctionapp APPSETTING_ getting appended"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":4302646,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d2615c5d20f39742fa1b783b834aeb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4302646/ashutosh-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570777486,"post_id":58335278,"comment_id":103028342,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335144/azurefunctionapp-appsetting-getting-appended/58335278#comment103028342_58335278"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":32120,"user_id":224370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CPH4K.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ian Mercer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224370/ian-mercer"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570774742,"creation_date":1570774742,"answer_id":58335278,"question_id":58335144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58335278","body_markdown":"You can&#39;t use &quot;_&quot; in a secret name.\r\n\r\n&gt; An object-name is a user provided name for and must be unique within a\r\n&gt; Key Vault.

If it is set, stream the missing data gap to them, immediately. And you should set the `id` header for each message you push out, to some unique identifier.\r\n\r\nOn the client side, for your particular use case, you do not need to do anything: when SSE reconnect runs it sends that header automatically, using the id of the last data it had received.\r\n\r\nIn chapter 5 of my book Data Push Apps with HTML5 SSE, I argue you should also include that same unique id, explcitly, in the JSON data packet you push out, and you should support the `Last-Event-ID` being given as a POST/GET argument as well. This gives you the flexibility to work with the long-polling alternative approaches to SSE, and also means it can work if the reconnect came from the client-side rather than the server-side.  (The former would be for supporting older browsers, though that matter less and less as IE dies out; the latter would be needed if you implement your own keep-alive mechanism.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-eventsource-20090421/#concept-event-stream-last-event-id","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335110/some-of-server-sent-events-lost-while-eventsource-reconnecting/58374643#58374643","title":"Some of Server Sent events lost while EventSource reconnecting"}],"owner":{"reputation":847,"user_id":2726561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8305eb6b7caf74b7d5e75989d8ec09fe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vovan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2726561/vovan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58374643,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571048160,"creation_date":1570773833,"question_id":58335110,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58335110","body_markdown":"In our application we have SSE connection with living time 5 minutes, after 5 minutes server closes the connection and client reconnect automatically.\r\n\r\nBut here the problem: while client reconnecting, there might some event happened on backend and it will not be passed to SSE connection, because it’s not established yet.\r\n\r\nSo there are some time slots 1-2sec when we may loose events.\r\n\r\nHow we can handle this case ?

But how can you (if at all) run batches through it like you can with the Windows command line?\r\n\r\n**The details:**\r\n\r\nIf you write...\r\n\r\n    cd C:\\test\\\r\n    REM executeSomething.exe\r\n    Pause\r\n\r\n... to a textfile and save it as a `.bat` file you can do can do pretty much anything just by double-clicking that file. I&#39;ve got a work-flow where I launch a web-application through a batch file. Sometimes this applicaton launches automatically in Chrome, [and sometimes it does not][2]. In that case, I&#39;ll have to copy and paste a URL to Chrome manually. And that&#39;s a real pain. With `cmder.exe` that&#39;s much easier, but I&#39;ll have to manually navigate to a folder and start the application through Commander it manually without the luxury of a `.bat file`.\r\n\r\nThe functionality I&#39;m trying to run automatically with cmder.exe is simply changing a folder and starting an executable file, specifically `Jupyter Lab`:\r\n\r\n    cd C:\\jupyterlab\\\r\n    jupyter lab\r\n    Pause\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried various approaches with:\r\n\r\n    @echo off\r\n    set CMDER_ROOT=C:\\Cmder\r\n    start %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /icon &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\cmder.exe&quot; /title &quot;Homestead VM&quot; /loadcfgfile &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\ConEmu.xml&quot; /cmd cmd /k &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\init.bat cd %CD% &amp;&amp; %~1&quot;\r\n\r\nas described [here][3], but with no success. The example above *does* launch commander, but also raises a syntax error:\r\n\r\n&gt; Current directory: C:\\batches\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Command to be executed: &quot;C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe&quot;  /k\r\n&gt; &quot;C:\\Cmder\\vendor\\init.bat cd C:\\batches &amp;&amp; &quot;\r\n\r\nI&#39;m obviously on to somehting here since I&#39;m able to start Commander, but I&#39;m not sure how to edit the remaining code to run the necessary steps. I do realize that the `/title &quot;Homestead VM&quot;` part just edits the title of the Commander window:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nbut I have no idea about the rest.\r\n\r\nIf this just isn&#39;t possible, I&#39;m going to have to try to reassociate `.bat` files in `Control Panel &gt; Default Programs &gt; Associate a filetype`, but I&#39;m hoping to avoid that.\r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions!\r\n\r\n**System info:**\r\n\r\n    Windows 7, 64 bit\r\n    Commander v1.3.12\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Edit 1:** My (failed) attempt trying to follow a suggestion from Gerhard Barnard\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve saved a file named `please.cmd` to `C:\\Windows\\System32` that contains this:\r\n\r\n    @echo off\r\n    if not defined CMDER_ROOT set &quot;CMDER_ROOT=C:\\Cmder&quot;\r\n    start %CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\conemu-maximus5\\ConEmu.exe /icon &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\cmder.exe&quot; /title &quot;Homestead VM&quot; /loadcfgfile &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\config\\ConEmu.xml&quot; /cmd cmd /k &quot;%CMDER_ROOT%\\vendor\\init.bat cd %CD% &amp;&amp; %~1&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also saved a file named `SObatch.bat` in `C:\\batches` that contains this:\r\n\r\n    if not defined myComs set myComs=0 &amp;&amp; please %~0\r\n    @echo off\r\n    ping localhost\r\n    echo %userprofile%\r\n    pause\r\n\r\nUpon double-clicking `SObatch.bat` a Windows prompt is opened, and the pings are run:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\nI just narrowed the window to leave out real-world user-names. But the ping functions are being run and the usual responses are returned.\r\n\r\nSo I guess it still seems that I&#39;ve broken something.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cmder.net/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54363942/starting-jupyter-from-batch-will-not-open-web-browser\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/cmderdev/cmder/issues/457\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6mlj.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLfwK.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58335103/how-to-run-batches-not-using-cmd-exe-like-cmder-exe","title":"How to run batches NOT using cmd.exe (like Cmder.exe?)"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8567}
