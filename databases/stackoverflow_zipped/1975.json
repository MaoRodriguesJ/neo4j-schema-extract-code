Please submit a filled Character Sheet!&quot;)\r\n\r\nelse:\r\n    for i in fields:\r\n        field = resolve1(i)\r\n        name, value = field.get(&#39;T&#39;), field.get(&#39;V&#39;)\r\n        if value is None or str(value)[2:-1] == &quot;&quot;:\r\n            value = &quot;b&#39;None&#39;&quot;\r\n        my_dict[str(name)[2:-1]] = str(value)[2:-1]\r\n\r\n    for g in list(my_dict.items()):\r\n        print(g)\r\n```\r\nThe output from the unedited PDF file:\r\n```python\r\n(&#39;ClassLevel&#39;, &#39;Assassin 1&#39;)\r\n(&#39;Background&#39;, &#39;Lone Survivor&#39;)\r\n(&#39;PlayerName&#39;, &#39;None&#39;)\r\n(&#39;CharacterName&#39;, &#39;Tumas Mitshil&#39;)\r\n(&#39;Race &#39;, &#39;Human&#39;)\r\netc...\r\n```\r\nThe output when it was edited (I changed the ClassLevel, etc. completely in the PDF):\r\n```python\r\n(&#39;ClassLevel&#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00C\\\\x00l\\\\x00a\\\\x00s\\\\x00s\\\\x00L\\\\x00e\\\\x00v\\\\x00e\\\\x00l&#39;)\r\n(&#39;Background&#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00B\\\\x00a\\\\x00c\\\\x00k\\\\x00g\\\\x00r\\\\x00o\\\\x00u\\\\x00n\\\\x00d\\\\x00r&#39;)\r\n(&#39;PlayerName&#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00P\\\\x00l\\\\x00a\\\\x00y\\\\x00e\\\\x00r\\\\x00N\\\\x00a\\\\x00m\\\\x00e&#39;)\r\n(&#39;CharacterName&#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00T\\\\x00h\\\\x00o\\\\x00m\\\\x00a\\\\x00s&#39;)\r\n(&#39;Race &#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00R\\\\x00a\\\\x00c\\\\x00e&#39;)\r\n(&#39;Alignment&#39;, &#39;\\\\xfe\\\\xff\\\\x00A\\\\x00l\\\\x00i\\\\x00g\\\\x00n\\\\x00m\\\\x00e\\\\x00n\\\\x00t&#39;)\r\netc...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is an encoding of some sort, and a few Google searches led me to believe it was in UTF-8 encode, so I attempted to decode the PDF when opening the file:\r\n```python\r\nfp = open(filename, &#39;rb&#39;).read().decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\n```\r\nUnfortunately, I am met with an error:\r\n```python\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;main.py&quot;, line 16, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    fp = open(filename, &#39;rb&#39;).read().decode(&#39;utf-8&#39;)\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: &#39;utf-8&#39; codec can&#39;t decode byte 0xe2 in position 10: invalid continuation byte\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I first made the PDF, I used Adobe Acrobat. However, I used Microsoft Edge to edit the file, which resulted in the problem I am facing. Here are the files:\r\n\r\n[Original File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11ZmvDrkWOke-YuFhfhWJUmi-Nf8bv3wZ/view?usp=sharing)\r\n[Edited File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Leil3lFvDwEMpZa9zNm9URhDtflgcuMH/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\nIs there any way to properly decode this? Is there a way to encode the edited pdf so it can be loaded into python without trouble? And if this is encoded, are there other forms of encoding, and how would I decode those?\r\n\r\nAny help will be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071962/pdf-file-to-dict-returns-weird-characters","title":"PDF File to Dict Returns Weird

The Context\r\nI am climbing the [Nearley](https://nearley.js.org/) learning curve and trying to write a grammar for a search query parser.\r\n\r\n## The Goal\r\nI would like to write grammar that is able to parse a querystring that contains boolean operators (e.g. `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`).  Lets use `AND` for this question as a trivial case.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the grammar should recognize these example strings as valid:\r\n\r\n* pants\r\n* pants AND socks\r\n* jumping jacks\r\n\r\n## The Attempt\r\nMy naive attempt looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nquery -&gt; \r\n    statement\r\n  | statement &quot;AND&quot; statement\r\n\r\nstatement -&gt; .:+\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\nThe above grammar attempt is ambiguous because `.:+` will match literally any string.\r\nWhat I really want is for the first condition to match any string that does not contain `AND` in it.  Once &quot;AND&quot; appears I want to enter the second condition only.\r\n\r\n##The Question\r\nHow can I detect these two distinct cases without having ambiguous grammar?\r\n\r\nI am worried I&#39;m missing something fundamental; I can imagine a ton of use cases where we want arbitrary text split up by known operators.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071937/how-can-i-write-an-unambiguous-nearley-grammar-for-boolean-search-operators","title":"How can I write an unambiguous nearley grammar for boolean search operators"},{"tags":["email","outlook","calendar","microsoft-graph","exchange-server"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1272,"user_id":109739,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09759c43e9299933643b810afef53a8e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jeremy Thake MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/109739/jeremy-thake-msft"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570656159,"creation_date":1570656159,"answer_id":58312498,"question_id":58071935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58312498","body_markdown":"The Microsoft Graph has change notifications (webhooks) that allow you to subscribe to events to a particular mailbox which includes a calendar.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/webhooks\r\n\r\nThis would satisfy any events that get created in Office 365 notifying your own API service that could then call the Service NOw API to create/update the event.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m assuming Service Now also has web hooks for their calendar so you could do it in the other direction.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071935/how-can-i-achieve-bi-directional-calender-integration-between-o365-servicenow/58312498#58312498","title":"How can i achieve bi-directional calender integration between o365 &amp;

For the above the array, the correct solution would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[1,2] , [2,9] , [3,7] , [10,19]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 3 &lt; 10\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071919/is-there-a-way-to-sort-an-array-by-a-subarrays-index-in-swift","title":"Is there a way to sort an array by a subarray&#39;s index in Swift?"},{"tags":["tensorflow","keras","tensorflow2.0"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":3594531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27KVz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Blaine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3594531/rick-blaine"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569300528,"post_id":58072987,"comment_id":102541572,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071917/tensorflow-2-0-keras-wont-save-best-model-even-with-validation-data-still-give/58072987#comment102541572_58072987"},{"owner":{"reputation":48412,"user_id":2097240,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JskU5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel M&#246;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2097240/daniel-m%c3%b6ller"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":3594531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27KVz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Blaine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3594531/rick-blaine"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569330991,"post_id":58072987,"comment_id":102556667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071917/tensorflow-2-0-keras-wont-save-best-model-even-with-validation-data-still-give/58072987#comment102556667_58072987"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":3594531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27KVz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Blaine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3594531/rick-blaine"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569341318,"post_id":58072987,"comment_id":102562577,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071917/tensorflow-2-0-keras-wont-save-best-model-even-with-validation-data-still-give/58072987#comment102562577_58072987"},{"owner":{"reputation":48412,"user_id":2097240,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JskU5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel M&#246;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2097240/daniel-m%c3%b6ller"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13,"user_id":3594531,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/27KVz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rick Blaine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3594531/rick-blaine"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569341589,"post_id":58072987,"comment_id":102562727,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071917/tensorflow-2-0-keras-wont-save-best-model-even-with-validation-data-still-give/58072987#comment102562727_58072987"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":48412,"user_id":2097240,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JskU5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel M&#246;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2097240/daniel-m%c3%b6ller"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569298189,"creation_date":1569298189,"answer_id":58072987,"question_id":58071917,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58072987","body_markdown":"Make sure `val_acc` exists in the logs.   \r\n\r\nGet the history from a short training:    \r\n\r\n    histCallback = model.fit(smallBatch_X, smallBatch_Y, epochs = 1)\r\n\r\nCheck what is in it:\r\n\r\n    for key in histCallback.history:\r\n        print(key)\r\n\r\nMaybe you will find `val_accuracy` instead.

If the attacker was able to unlock your phone using the very same biometrics you use to secure your app, what advantage have you gained?\r\n\r\n - What attack vectors are you opened to, for an app to be securing user data in keychain but not using biometrics as the additional second factor?\r\n\r\n - some apps, also use 4 digit PIN entry as an alternative to biometrics, isn&#39;t this a placebo? i.e. the bulk of the app security comes from the fact that the application is relying on an operating system that provides a keychain and secure mechanism for this app, and only this app, to retrieve its secrets.

Your styles for your global css for your routed component as follows\r\n```\r\nrouter-outlet + * {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  height: 100vh;\r\n  width: 100vw;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Update your component CSS (Optional).

See the [link][1] for the reference\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/SensioFrameworkExtraBundle/annotations/converters.html#doctrineconverter-options","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071868/access-control-configuration-throws-app-entity-patientorder-object-not-found-by/58072283#58072283","title":"Access control configuration throws &quot;App\\Entity\\PatientOrder object not found by the @ParamConverter annotation.&quot; error"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9330746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4pLJc_JUY6o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABg/iCndQXJONe0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian Barrick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9330746/brian-barrick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569333987,"creation_date":1569333987,"answer_id":58082131,"question_id":58071868,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58082131","body_markdown":"This turned out to be a routing error - the logout button was configured to point to app_logout however, it was hitting a route I had set up as /{id} before it got to my / route.

I have tried absolute path as well and in all cases it can find the datastore, just not the folder:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncloud_provider:\r\n  name: vsphere\r\n  vsphereCloudProvider:\r\n    global:\r\n      insecure-flag: true\r\n    virtual_center:\r\n      www.vcenterserver.com:\r\n        user: administrator@vsphere.local  \r\n        password: blahblahblah\r\n        datacenters: Datacenter\r\n    workspace:\r\n      server: www.vcenterserver.com:\r\n      folder: rancher-pv-01\r\n      datacenter: Datacenter\r\n      default-datastore: SC02\r\n    disk:\r\n      scsicontrollertype: pvscsi\r\n    network:\r\n      public-network: DHCP\r\n```\r\n\r\nSorry I forgot to include the actual error...\r\n\r\n```\r\nI0924 18:03:04.603132       1 event.go:209] Event(v1.ObjectReference{Kind:&quot;PersistentVolumeClaim&quot;, Namespace:&quot;default&quot;, Name:&quot;vol-01&quot;, UID:&quot;0cfbd0ec-def5-11e9-8275-005056b17f97&quot;, APIVersion:&quot;v1&quot;, ResourceVersion:&quot;7961&quot;, FieldPath:&quot;&quot;}): type: &#39;Warning&#39; reason: &#39;ProvisioningFailed&#39; Failed to provision volume with StorageClass &quot;vcenter-storage-class&quot;: folder &#39;rancher-pv-01&#39; not found\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071844/rancher-vmware-persistent-folder-storage-path","title":"Rancher/Vmware Persistent Folder Storage Path"},{"tags":["mysql","optimization","pt-query-digest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2137,"user_id":4876561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LrLr2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jerry M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4876561/jerry-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569287719,"post_id":58071841,"comment_id":102539259,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071841/how-to-detect-the-missing-sql-by-comparing-rows-examine-and-rows-send#comment102539259_58071841"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12110341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBGZJl8RAdctxfxQcRZZ8Ohza0NP45qhB4lrdJq=k-s128","display_name":"longshuai bai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12110341/longshuai-bai"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569287599,"creation_date":1569287599,"question_id":58071841,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58071841","body_markdown":"&gt; # Attribute          total     min     max     avg     95%  stddev  median\r\n&gt; # ============     ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= ======= =======\r\n&gt; # Rows sent          8.20k     200   7.81k   2.73k   7.68k   3.53k  192.76\r\n&gt; # Rows examine      16.02k     200  15.62k   5.34k  15.20k   7.08k  192.76","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071841/how-to-detect-the-missing-sql-by-comparing-rows-examine-and-rows-send","title":"How to detect the missing SQL by comparing Rows examine and Rows Send?"},{"tags":["html","arrays","laravel","foreach"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":10586543,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ajx6S1NgkRw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbAzTmsX7x2COdvnor2-ftKa-H8iuA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tanvir Ahmed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10586543/tanvir-ahmed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569293466,"post_id":58071840,"comment_id":102540211,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071840/better-way-of-getting-array-data-from-input-in-laravel#comment102540211_58071840"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":9481471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5ce3fee9f2ee8cc2f17b3246a1cc973?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ershad Ahamed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9481471/ershad-ahamed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569464235,"creation_date":1569464235,"answer_id":58108695,"question_id":58071840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58108695","body_markdown":"Actually the foreach approach was wrong.

To maximize parallel efficiency, Volta includes a schedule optimizer which determines\r\nhow to group active threads from the same warp together into SIMT units. This retains the high\r\nthroughput of SIMT execution as in prior NVIDIA GPUs, but with much more flexibility: threads\r\ncan now diverge and reconverge at sub-warp granularity, while the convergence optimizer in\r\nVolta will still group together threads which are executing the same code and run them in parallel\r\nfor maximum efficiency\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause of this, a Volta warp could have any number of subgroups of threads (up to the warp size, 32), which could be at different places in the instruction stream.  The Volta designers decided that the best way to support this flexibility was to provide (among other things) a separate PC per thread in the warp.

sending a response back to the client with:\r\n\r\n    res.status(200).json(comments)\r\n\r\nThis sets at least two headers (the status, and the response type) and then sends the response. Next time you get an update from the database, this code runs again, and again tries to send the two headers. But in HTTP all headers must be before the main body of the response. So the second time this code runs, it throws an error.\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep sending more data to the client, you&#39;ll need to use more primitive methods of the response object to prevent sending headers, or other illegal data. While possible, it&#39;s more complex than you may think, as the client needs to handle this response stream, which most clients won&#39;t.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d highly recommend looking at Doug&#39;s alternative, which is to just use the Firebase Realtime Database from the client directly. That way you can use the client SDK that it has, which handles this (and many more complexities) behind the scenes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071810/cant-create-a-listener-to-the-database-while-also-being-able-to-update-it-usi/58075210#58075210","title":"Can&#39;t create a listener to the database while also being able to update it.

of a non-existing key in a hash, you are in fact returning a container that will auto-vivify the key in the hash when assigned to:\r\n\r\n    my %hash;\r\n    sub get($key) { return-rw %hash{$key} }\r\n    get(&quot;foo&quot;) = 42;\r\n    dd %hash;   # Hash %hash = {:foo(42)}\r\n\r\nPlease note that you need to use `return-rw` here to ensure the actual container is returned, rather than just the value in the container.  Alternately, you can use the `is raw` trait, which allows you to just set the last value:  \r\n\r\n    my %hash;\r\n    sub get($key) is raw { %hash{$key} }\r\n    get(&quot;foo&quot;) = 42;\r\n    dd %hash;   # Hash %hash = {:foo(42)}\r\n\r\nNote that you should *not* use `return` in that case, as that will still de-containerize again.\r\n\r\nTo get back to your question:\r\n\r\n&gt; I want to track if I&#39;ve actually modified `%!attrs` or have only just read the value when `FALLBACK` was called.\r\n\r\n    class Foo {\r\n        has %!attrs;\r\n        has %!unexpected;\r\n\r\n        method TWEAK() { %!attrs&lt;bar&gt; = &#39;bar&#39; }\r\n\r\n        method FALLBACK(Str:D $name, *@rest) is raw {\r\n            if %!attrs{$name}:exists {\r\n                %!attrs{$name}\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n                %!unexpected{$name}++;\r\n                Any\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis would either return the container found in the hash, or record the access to the unknown key and return an immutable `Any`.\r\n\r\nRegarding plan B, recording changes: for that you could use a [Proxy](https://docs.perl6.org/type/Proxy) object for that.\r\n\r\nHope this helps in your quest.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071806/how-to-know-if-returning-an-l-value-when-using-fallback/58077283#58077283","title":"How to know if returning an l-value when using `FALLBACK`?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":602,"user_id":236353,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aad37b5f7116c8d1f547d23b37566032?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gdonald","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/236353/gdonald"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569374594,"post_id":58089212,"comment_id":102572952,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071806/how-to-know-if-returning-an-l-value-when-using-fallback/58089212#comment102572952_58089212"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16841,"user_id":1077672,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f00f8b55b0ade2c4748e94fb73a40662?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"raiph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1077672/raiph"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569366933,"creation_date":1569366933,"answer_id":58089212,"question_id":58071806,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58089212","body_markdown":"Liz&#39;s answer is full of useful info and you&#39;ve accepted it but I thought the following might still be of interest.\r\n\r\n&gt; How to know if returning an l-value ... ?\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s start by ignoring the `FALLBACK` clause.\r\n\r\nYou would have to test the value. To deal with `Scalar`s, you must test the [`.VAR`](https://docs.perl6.org/language/mop#index-entry-syntax_VAR-VAR) of the value. (For non-`Scalar` values the `.VAR` acts like a &quot;no op&quot;.) I *think* (but don&#39;t quote me) that `Scalar|Array|Hash` covers all the *l-value* super-types:\r\n```\r\nmy \\value       = 42;  # Int is an l-value is False\r\nmy \\l-value-one = $;   # Scalar is an l-value is True\r\nmy \\l-value-too = @;   # Array is an l-value is True\r\n\r\nsay &quot;{.VAR.^name} is an l-value is {.VAR ~~ Scalar|Array|Hash}&quot;\r\n  for value, l-value-one, l-value-too\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; How to know if returning an l-value *when using `FALLBACK`*?\r\n\r\nAdding &quot;when using `FALLBACK`&quot; makes no difference to the answer.\r\n\r\n&gt; How can I know if I actually *need* to return an *l-value* ... ?\r\n\r\nAgain, let&#39;s start by ignoring the `FALLBACK` clause.\r\n\r\nThis is a completely different question than &quot;How to know if returning an l-value ... ?&quot;. I think it&#39;s the core of your question.\r\n\r\nAfaik, the answer is, you need to anticipate how the returned value will be used. If there&#39;s *any* chance it&#39;ll be used as an *l-value*, and you want that usage to work, then you need to return an *l-value*. The language/compiler can&#39;t (or at least doesn&#39;t) help you make that decision.\r\n\r\nConsider some related scenarios:\r\n```\r\nmy $baz := foo.bar;\r\n... (100s of lines of code) ...\r\n$baz = 42;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless the first line returns an *l-value*, the second line will fail.\r\n\r\nBut the situation is actually much more immediate than that:\r\n```\r\nroutine-foo = 42;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`routine-foo` is evaluated first, in its entirety, *before the `lhs = rhs` expression is evaluated*.\r\n\r\nUnless the compiler&#39;s resolution of the `routine-foo` call somehow incorporated the fact that the very next thing to happen would be that the `lhs` will be assigned to, then there would be no way for a singly or multiply dispatched `routine-foo` to know whether it can safely return an *r-value* or must return an *l-value*.\r\n\r\nAnd the compiler&#39;s resolution does *not* incorporate that. Thus, for example:\r\n```\r\nmulti term:&lt;bar&gt; is rw { ... }\r\nmulti term:&lt;bar&gt;       { ... }\r\nbar = 99; # Ambiguous call to &#39;term:&lt;bar&gt;(...)&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can *imagine* this one day (N years from now) being solved by a combination of allowing `=` to be an overloadable operator, robust macros that allow overloading of `=` being available, and routine resolution being modified so the above ambiguous call could do something equivalent to resolving to the `is rw` multi. But I doubt it will *actually* come to pass even with N=10. Perhaps there is another way but I can&#39;t think of one at the moment.\r\n\r\n&gt; How can I know if I actually need to return an *l-value* *when using `FALLBACK`*?\r\n\r\nAgain, adding &quot;when using `FALLBACK`&quot; makes no difference to the answer.\r\n\r\n&gt; I want to track if I&#39;ve actually modified `%!attrs` or have only just read the value when `FALLBACK` was called.\r\n\r\nWhen `FALLBACK` is called it doesn&#39;t know what context it&#39;s being called in -- *r-value* or *l-value*. Any modification comes after it has already returned.\r\n\r\nIn other words, whatever solution you come up with will being nothing to do per se with `FALLBACK` (even if you have to use it to implement some other aspect of whatever it is you&#39;re trying to do).\r\n\r\n(Even if it were, I suspect trying to solve it via `FALLBACK` itself would just make matters *worse*. One can imagine writing two `FALLBACK` multis, one with an `is rw` trait, but, as explained above, my imagination doesn&#39;t stretch to that making any difference any time soon, if ever, and could only happen if the above imaginary things happened (the macros etc.) *and* the compiler was *also* modified to pay attention to the two `FALLBACK` multi variants, and I&#39;m not at all meaning to suggest that that even makes sense.)\r\n\r\n# Plan B\r\n\r\n&gt; Or (alternate plan B) can I attach a callback or something similar to my `%!attrs` to monitor for changes?\r\n\r\nAs Lizmat notes, that&#39;s the realm of `Proxy`s. And thus your next SO question... :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071806/how-to-know-if-returning-an-l-value-when-using-fallback/58089212#58089212","title":"How to know if returning an l-value when using `FALLBACK`?"}],"owner":{"reputation":602,"user_id":236353,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aad37b5f7116c8d1f547d23b37566032?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gdonald","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/236353/gdonald"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":91,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58077283,"answer_count":2,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1569366933,"creation_date":1569287159,"question_id":58071806,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58071806","body_markdown":"How can I know if I actually need to return an l-value when using `FALLBACK`?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using `return-rw` but I&#39;d like to only use `return` where possible.

I think I am missing the UserDetailsService implementation however I am not sure how to implement it.\r\n\r\nHere is my User domain class:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class User{\r\n\r\n    private int id;\r\n\r\n    private String name;\r\n\r\n    private String lastName;\r\n\r\n    private String username;\r\n\r\n    private String password;\r\n\r\n    private String email;\r\n\r\n    private String enabled;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is my WebSecurityConfiguration class\r\n\r\n```\r\n@EnableWebSecurity\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableWebMvc\r\npublic class WebSecurityConfiguration extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    DataSource dataSource;\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void configure(final HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {\r\n        http\r\n                .csrf()\r\n                .disable()\r\n                .authorizeRequests()\r\n                .antMatchers(&quot;/h2-console/**&quot;, &quot;/registration&quot;)\r\n                .permitAll()\r\n                .anyRequest().authenticated()\r\n                .and()\r\n                .formLogin()\r\n                .permitAll()\r\n                .and()\r\n                .logout()\r\n                .permitAll();\r\n\r\n        http.csrf()\r\n                .ignoringAntMatchers(&quot;/h2-console/**&quot;);\r\n        http.headers()\r\n                .frameOptions()\r\n                .sameOrigin();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    public void configureGlobal(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception {\r\n\r\n        //Move these to repository and call method\r\n        String userbyUsernameQuery = &quot;select username, password, &#39;1&#39; as enabled from auth_user where username=?;&quot;;\r\n        String rolebyUsernameQuery = &quot;SELECT auth_user.username, auth_role.role_name as authority from auth_user\\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;INNER JOIN auth_user_role ON auth_user.auth_user_id = auth_user_role.auth_user_id\\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;INNER JOIN auth_role ON auth_role.auth_role_id = auth_user_role.auth_role_id\\n&quot; +\r\n                &quot;WHERE auth_user.username =?&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\n        auth.jdbcAuthentication()\r\n                .dataSource(dataSource)\r\n                .usersByUsernameQuery(userbyUsernameQuery)\r\n        .authoritiesByUsernameQuery(rolebyUsernameQuery)\r\n        .passwordEncoder(passwordEncoder());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is a page where I am testing the outputs of logged in users and roles:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot; xmlns:th=&quot;http://www.thymeleaf.org&quot; xmlns:sec=&quot;http://www.thymeleaf.org/extras/spring-security&quot;&gt;&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Main Page&lt;/title&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt; Main Page&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div sec:authorize=&quot;isAuthenticated()&quot;&gt;\r\n    This content is only shown to authenticated users.\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div sec:authorize=&quot;hasRole(&#39;ROLE_ADMIN&#39;)&quot;&gt;\r\n    This content is only shown to administrators.\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div sec:authorize=&quot;hasRole(&#39;ROLE_USER&#39;)&quot;&gt;\r\n    This content is only shown to users.\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nLogged user: &lt;span sec:authentication=&quot;name&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\nRoles: &lt;span sec:authentication=&quot;principal.authorities&quot;&gt;[ROLE_USER, ROLE_ADMIN]&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI have a feeling that I need to implement UserDetailsService.

If so how do I use this to restrict access to certain pages\r\n\r\nI want to achieve displaying the logged in user on a page and if they have authority/the right role to view the page.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071791/how-do-i-find-the-logged-in-user-and-role-using-spring-security-using-custom-aut","title":"How do I find the logged in user and role using

I&#39;ve implemented one more component, namely, one more page that user may go to with the help of the menu and the requirements are to make the footer background for this page white. I know it&#39;s far from being the best solution but as far as I understand that logic is pretty general so it seems fine to modify the footer.html in the following way:\r\n\r\n**footer.html**\r\n```\r\n&lt;footer class=&quot;footer&quot; [class.footer_bg-white]=&quot;wide || isOffer&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;footer__inner&quot; [class.footer__inner_wide]=&quot;wide [class.footer__inner_auth]=&quot;!authorized&quot;&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nso when `wide` is `false` but we&#39;re on the Offer page `isOffer` is set to `true` and the footer should turn white. The part responsible for this in the `footer.ts` file looks as follows:\r\n\r\n**footer.ts**\r\n```\r\n ngOnChanges() {\r\n    this.router.events.subscribe(\r\n      event =&gt; {\r\n        if (event instanceof NavigationStart &amp;&amp; event.url === &quot;/offer&quot;) {\r\n          this.isOffer = true;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that when I open the menu and go to that page, the route changes and `isOffer` becomes `true` but the footer background color does not change, I need to reload the page for the changes to be applied. So it looks like this way I have to recreate the footer component once more. \r\n\r\nHow do I achieve the desired behaviour?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071787/changing-footer-background-colour-on-route-change-in-angular","title":"Changing footer background colour on route change in

recently updated my Xcode from 10.3 to 11.0. \r\n\r\nI registered all the colors I am using among the app in a `Scheme.swift` file with its own struct. \r\n\r\nSince I updated, the `#colorLiteral`s are not computed properly by Xcode in my **struct constructor** but just written as code: \r\n\r\n**Xcode 11**\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Raw code, so you can copy/paste it in a playground*\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport UIKit\r\n\r\nstruct Theme {\r\n    var color1: UIColor\r\n    var color2: UIColor\r\n}\r\n\r\nTheme(color1: #colorLiteral(red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0),\r\n      color2: #colorLiteral(red: 1.0, green: 1.0, blue: 1.0, alpha: 1.0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know how I can force Xcode to refresh or compute these colorLiterals so I can use the color picker as usual? \r\n\r\nIs it not possible anymore to define a colorLiteral in a function call (here a struct init)?\r\n\r\n--------\r\n**Edit**\r\n\r\nIt seems to be related to the fact that my `#colorLiteral`s are written in a function call, before a `,`. If I surround it by parenthesis it automatically switch to a &quot;color picker&quot;. \r\n\r\nPlus, it doesn&#39;t happen to the **last colorLiteral** in the call\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/B70qi.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071785/xcode-11-colorliteral-written-instead-of-being-displayed-as-color","title":"Xcode 11 #colorLiteral written instead of being displayed as color"},{"tags":["django","python-3.x","django-templates","django-views"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":329,"user_id":3574939,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cca960339fca4e798e7a0c21ea1b31a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3574939","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3574939/user3574939"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569323655,"creation_date":1569323655,"answer_id":58079040,"question_id":58071783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58079040","body_markdown":"in cart.html I changed\r\n\r\n&gt; {% if cart.product.exists %}\r\n\r\n to \r\n\r\n&gt; {% if cart.products.exists %}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58071783/django-2-2-5-product-not-displaying-in-shopping-cart/58079040#58079040","title":"django 2.2.5 product not displaying in shopping cart"}],"owner":{"reputation":329,"user_id":3574939,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cca960339fca4e798e7a0c21ea1b31a3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3574939","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3574939/user3574939"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569323655,"creation_date":1569286889,"question_id":58071783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58071783","body_markdown":"I am creating a e-commerce site using django 2.2.5.

Is there any way to make the page display: “If you refresh, you will lose data”?\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve google searched what I can to make my project mostly functional and I&#39;m just stuck on this part. \r\n\r\nPage 1: \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;?php include_once(&#39;header.php&#39;);

All requests from the front end are post requests. \r\n\r\n  &lt;br/&gt;\r\n**The Behaviour**:  &lt;br/&gt;\r\nIn the code snippet below, the function, ***convert_data***, connects to a database and converts request into resp.\r\n```python\r\nclass ConvertDataView(View):\r\n    def post(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        request = json.loads(args[0].body.decode())\r\n        resp = api_utils.convert_data(request)\r\n        if resp:\r\n            return JsonResponse(resp, safe=False)\r\n        return JsonResponse({}, status=404)\r\n```\r\nWhen ever the inputs contains invalid characters such as \\\\, &#39;, &quot; etc, convert_data raises an exception. This varies from database to database but it is form of &quot;Query is invalid.&quot;.\r\n\r\n  &lt;br/&gt;\r\n**The Problem**:  &lt;br/&gt;\r\nAll subsequent queries to this core/thread continue to fail, even if the input is correct and does NOT contain any invalid characters. This behavior causes the app to be unstable and serve the information when the request goes to another core/thread but fail when it comes to this &quot;corrupted core/thread&quot;. \r\n\r\nThis error will continue to persist until the uwsgi server is restarted. After the uwsgi server is restarted, the app acts normal again.\r\n\r\n  &lt;br/&gt;\r\n**Things that seem to work**:  &lt;br/&gt;\r\nIf I perform exception handling in ***ConvertDataView***, this issue seems to remain. However, it seems that if I perform my exception handling in ***convert_data*** and always send back a valid response rather than raising an error, this error does not happen.\r\n\r\n\r\n  &lt;br/&gt;\r\n**Things I have tried**:  &lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n - Initially I thought the error could be due to teradata crashing. However, I  connected convert_data to other databases and still happens.\r\n - Then I thought maybe python is reusing the same database driver. But looking at the memory location of the driver object shows a different memory location. This means that a new database object is created, which is the expected behavior. \r\n - I tried replacing uwsgi with django&#39;s development server. But it seems, in this case, the response is always corrupted until the server is restarted.\r\n \r\n\r\nI do not know if this behavior will be occur for non-database related errors like KeyError, IndexError, etc. \r\n\r\n\r\nI am afraid of posting more source code as it is proprietary, but will answer any questions asked to the best of my
