I have a separate class that uses JavaFX to actually display the pixels after transformed. I am creating another class that will transform line based off user input. For example, if the user inserts &quot;basic translate,&quot; the line will translate based off the tx and ty values that the user inputs. The file is formatted like the following: \r\n\r\n```\r\n10 10 20 20 \r\n80 80 90 90\r\n10 80 10 90 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe numbers are ordered, respectively: `x0`, `y0`, `x1`, `y1`. Each line of numbers needs to be converted to an array.\r\n\r\nI guess my main problem here is reading the file, allowing the user to choose what they want to do from the given file (i.e. translate, scale, etc.) and THEN run it to the javafx class to display it after applying all wanted transformations. Making all transformation methods static is not working for me. I just am unsure of how to put all the pieces together.\r\n\r\nMaking the methods static doesn&#39;t work. FYI I&#39;m still relatively new to coding and this is probably an easy fix so please be easy on me :)\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {\t\t\r\n    \t\t\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Please pick from the following: &quot; + &quot;1. basic translate&quot;);\r\n    Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n    \r\n    String userInput = keyboard.nextLine();\r\n    \r\n    if (userInput.equalsIgnoreCase(&quot;basic translate&quot;)) {\r\n        basicTranslate();\r\n    } \r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void basicTranslate() {\r\n    Translate translate = new Translate();\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;Give values for Tx and Ty, respectively&quot;);\r\n    double tx = keyboard.nextDouble();\r\n    double ty = keyboard.nextDouble();\r\n    x0 += tx;\r\n    x1 += tx;\r\n    y0 += ty;\r\n    y1 += ty;\r\n    System.out.println(&quot;The new coordinates are: (&quot; +x0 +&quot;, &quot; + x1 +&quot;)&quot; + &quot;(&quot; + y0 + &quot;, &quot; + y1 +&quot;)&quot;);\r\n    \t\t\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic static void readFile() throws FileNotFoundException {\r\n    Scanner input = new Scanner(new File(&quot;file1&quot;));\r\n    String one = input.nextLine();\r\n    String two = input.nextLine();\r\n    String three = input.nextLine();\r\n    // need to enter code here convert each string to an array to then use and user input apply to line...also need to be able to apply it to any method\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are other methods besides the basicTranslate method. All of the other methods follow the same structure so I just removed them. My class to actually display the line is in a separate file and the main method in that class simply launches the program. So it was difficult for me to implement these methods in the same class.

It seems to be feature-order-specific.\r\n\r\nThe main metric on the model is MSE, and relative to some base model. Let `GAIN = 1 - MSE_model / MSE_base` be the performance gain using the model (or decrease in MSE). For the comparison, I fixed RNG and parameter sets.\r\n\r\n1) `GAIN(LightGBM.train(X1=[x1, x2]))=20%`,\r\n\r\n2) `GAIN(LightGBM.train(X2=[x1, x2, x3]))=30%`,\r\n\r\n3) `GAIN(LightGBM.train(X3=[x1, x2, x4]))=60%`,\r\n\r\n4) `GAIN(LightGBM.train(X4=[x1, x2, x3, x4]))=70%`.\r\n\r\nHence, I can conclude that `x4` is more important than `x3` (and than `x1, x2`): it adds more predictability to the model.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I calculate `SHAP` for 1), it returns ***`SHAP(x3) &gt; SHAP(x4)`***.\r\nMore surprisingly, when I used X in different order i.e. `X5=[x4, x3, x2, x1]` I get the same  `GAIN=70%`, but SHAP in different order: ***`SHAP(x4) &gt; SHAP(x3)`***. Worse, ***`SHAP(x1), SHAP(x2) &gt; SHAP(x4) `***.\r\n\r\nMaybe this is inherent to any decision trees: tree splits leaves with greedy algorithm, so if `x1` accidentally keeps being chosen as the first split variable, it will have a larger information gain even though it has a little contribution to MSE decrease.\r\n\r\n(https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/issues/1294 says LightGBM is feature-order-specific indeed: if 2 features have the same split gain, the feature with smaller index will be chosen. However, even if I use a different order the GAIN does not materially change, so I guess this is not due to `LightGBM.train`.)\r\n\r\nBut to my knowledge, `SHAP` considers the combination of feature orderings, so it should be independent of feature orders that I pass.\r\n\r\nIs it because I am being too restrictive to model parameters - say, max_depth or max_leaves?\r\n\r\n - I did limited `tree_limit=100` (which is my `n_estimator` of `LightGBM`) in `explainer.shap_values()`, whose default is `None` (b/c it took way too long w/o limit). Could this be the reason?\r\n\r\nOr the SHAP (or information gain) is consistent only within the given model, and I shouldn&#39;t make a judgement on &quot;feature importance&quot; by the decrease in MSE (i.e. concluding `x4` is more important than `x3` by comparing 1) - 4) is misleading)?\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it is feature-order-specific, are there any ways to fix it in `LightGBM`?\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nEDIT) I tried `tree_limit&gt;100`, and got ```SHAP(x4) &gt; SHAP(x3)```. As I increase `tree_limit` ```SHAP(x4) - SHAP(x3)``` increases. However, still `SHAP(x4)` is still not the largest, which should be. This may be the largest if I provide sufficiently large `tree_limit`, but calculation time increases linearly in `tree_limit` which I cannot increase more than some threshold. Is there a way for &quot;good initial values&quot;?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484238/is-shap-measure-or-information-gain-result-feature-order-specific","title":"Is SHAP measure (or information gain) result feature-order-specific?"},{"tags":["svn","visualsvn-server"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":23473,"user_id":761095,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aLooP.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"bahrep","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/761095/bahrep"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571752792,"creation_date":1571752792,"answer_id":58506014,"question_id":58484234,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58506014","body_markdown":"I think that wildcard permissions will help you, but they will become available in future product versions.

You can almost work that out backwards - an aggregate is going to be stored in a single database, a database is going to belong to a single (micro) service, a service is going to serve a single bounded context; therefore it follows that an aggregate is going to belong to a single bounded context.\r\n\r\nWhere things can get messy: it&#39;s easy to take some broad business concept, like &quot;order&quot;, and try to create a single representation for order that works for every bounded context.  That&#39;s not the goal though -- the goal is for each context to have a representation of order that works in that context.\r\n\r\nCommon example: sales, billing, fulfillment may all care about &quot;order&quot;, but the information that they need to share is largely just the order id, which acts as a correlation identifier so that they can coordinate conversations.\r\n\r\nSee Mauro Servienti: [All of Our Aggregates Are Wrong][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkzvQSuYd5I","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484184/ddd-how-many-aggregates-should-have-a-single-bounded-context/58485930#58485930","title":"DDD: How many aggregates should have a single bounded context?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1097,"user_id":188138,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a82790a733d2e5c6b052db9633545bf1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brad Irby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/188138/brad-irby"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571737784,"creation_date":1571737784,"answer_id":58501533,"question_id":58484184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58501533","body_markdown":"The trite answer is “just enough, but not too many”.  There is no real guidance on how many aggregates to put in a bounded context.\r\n\r\nThe thing that drives aggregates and entities is the Ubiquitous Language that is used to describe the context.  The Ubiquitous Language is different for each context, and the entities and aggregate roots needed in the context can be found in the nouns used in the language.  Once you have the domain fully described by the language, count up the nouns that have a special meaning in that language and you have a count of the entities necessary.\r\n\r\nBear in mind, though, that I&#39;ve rarely come across a bounded context that was &quot;fully described&quot;.  The goal is &quot;described fully enough for this release&quot;.  Therefore for any release the number of entities won&#39;t be &quot;enough&quot; and you&#39;ll probably have plans of adding more.

It&#39;s a little more involved inside of a `TagHelper `class, which doesn&#39;t have direct access to `HttpContext` and its `User` property. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an approach that uses the [`[ViewContext]`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.mvc.viewfeatures.viewcontextattribute?view=aspnetcore-3.0) attribute as a means to get hold of `HttpContext` and `User`, and uses dependency injection to get hold of the `IAuthorizationService`:\r\n\r\n    public class PassportTagHelper : TagHelper\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly IAuthorizationService authorizationService;\r\n    \r\n        public PassportTagHelper(IAuthorizationService authorizationService)\r\n        {\r\n            this.authorizationService = authorizationService;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        [ViewContext]\r\n        public ViewContext ViewContext { get; set; }\r\n    \r\n        public override async Task ProcessAsync(TagHelperContext ctx, TagHelperOutput output)\r\n        {\r\n            var httpContext = ViewContext.HttpContext;\r\n            var authorizationResult = await authorizationService\r\n                .AuthorizeAsync(httpContext.User, &quot;UserHasRecentPassport&quot;);\r\n    \r\n            if (!authorizationResult.Succeeded)\r\n                output.SuppressOutput();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThings to note:\r\n\r\n* `HttpContext` is access via the `ViewContext` property, which is set automatically when decorated with the `ViewContext` attribute.\r\n* `Process` becomes `ProcessAsync`, so that it can `await` the call to `AuthorizeAsync`.\r\n* The value returned from `AuthorizeAsync` is an [`AuthorizationResult`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authorization.authorizationresult?view=aspnetcore-3.0), which indicates success via its `Succeeded` property and a reason for failure in its `Failure` property.\r\n\r\nThere are other options, such as injecting and using `IHttpContextAccessor` to get the `HttpContext` instance rather than using the `[ViewContext]` attribute. As a general rule, I try to avoid `IHttpContextAccessor` where possible, but that doesn&#39;t mean you should do the same.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484173/how-to-check-asp-net-auth-policy-in-code-rather-than-using-authorizeattribute/58484596#58484596","title":"How to check ASP.NET auth policy in code rather than using AuthorizeAttribute?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13093,"user_id":178757,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/487b39e86dd577c22005472b9a307b1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/178757/jez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571654495,"creation_date":1571652982,"question_id":58484173,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484173","body_markdown":"The normal way to check that a policy is being fulfilled in ASP.NET Core&#39;s authorization system is to setup a policy in `ConfigureServices` like so:\r\n\r\n    services.AddAuthorization(conf =&gt; {\r\n        conf.AddPolicy(&quot;UserHasRecentPassport&quot;, policy =&gt; policy.RequireAssertion(ctx =&gt; { return ctx.User.HasRecentPassport(); }));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n... and then specify it for a controller or action using `AuthorizeAttribute`, like so:\r\n\r\n    [Authorize(&quot;UserHasRecentPassport&quot;)]\r\n    public class HomeController : Controller {\r\n        public IActionResult Index() {\r\n            return View();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;m writing a tag helper which needs to check whether a particular policy is being met.

`app.use(bodyParser.json())`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484169/req-body-coming-up-empty/58484303#58484303","title":"Req.body coming up

Doing so is overly complex, a nightmare to maintain and dead slow to execute. Instead, store the image addresses into a JS array, and keep book of the index for showing images, something like this:\r\n\r\nIn the HTML, pass the event object: `onclick=&quot;clickimg(event)&quot;`, or rather add the event listener in the script:\r\n\r\n    const imgs = [\r\n        &#39;img/image1.jpg&#39;,\r\n        &#39;img/image2.jpg&#39;,\r\n        &#39;img/image3.jpg&#39;\r\n    ];\r\n    let index = 0;\r\n    document.getElementById(&#39;roadtrip&#39;).addEventListener(\r\n        &#39;click&#39;, clickimg // If you&#39;ll do this, remove the onclick attribute from the img tag\r\n    );\r\n    function clickimg (e) {\r\n        e.target.src = imgs[index]; // Change the src of the clicked image\r\n        index = ++index % imgs.length; // Increase index, shows the first image when the length of the array is reached\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis way the image addresses are easy to maintain, if you need more images, just add an address to `imgs` array. Or you can change or remove some of the images just by manipulating the array.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484120/change-img-src-with-onclick-method/58484509#58484509","title":"Change img src with onclick method"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12250732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-QDUxRT2cs4M/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcP89rq_AxA4cAnDok-q9kdEdAN4g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"scips","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12250732/scips"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58484275,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571655097,"creation_date":1571652776,"question_id":58484120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484120","body_markdown":"I would like to change my img source when I click on the img.\r\n(When I click on img1 I want to see img2.

But again, it&#39;s make sense to test real code.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_stub\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484081/c-unittest-with-linktime-substitution/58485756#58485756","title":"C++ unitTest with LinkTime substitution"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12250312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/760fd9e8f1929a2d12912deb44a0b751?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sspet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12250312/sspet"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571658777,"creation_date":1571652612,"last_edit_date":1571653204,"question_id":58484081,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484081","body_markdown":"I&#39;m reading &quot;Test-Driven Development for Embedded C,&quot; by James W.

In my case it doesn&#39;t make sense to visit the page and download the files as they are already in memory and should be imported from node server.\r\n\r\nSo here is example of how I&#39;ve been doing it so far.\r\n\r\nServer.js:\r\n```js\r\n// Templating library\r\nconst mustache = require(&quot;mustache&quot;);\r\n// Javascript to be imported into html as inline script\r\nconst someFunction = require(&quot;./src/someFunction.js&quot;).toString();\r\n\r\napp.get(&quot;/:id&quot;, async (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n  // Get data from DB\r\n  const data = await MongooseSchema.find({ id: req.params.id });\r\n\r\n  // Read html view\r\n  const view = fs.readFileSync(&quot;./views/report.html&quot;, &quot;utf8&quot;});\r\n\r\n  // Render with mustache\r\n  const html = mustache.to_html(view, {\r\n    data,\r\n    javascript: { someFunction }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // Send rendered html\r\n  res.send(html);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd report.html includes this script tag:\r\n```html\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n  const data = {{{data}}};\r\n  {{{javascript.someFunction}}}\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am importing javascript files as strings and then rendering them inside the html file using mustache templating library. This approach seems kind of hacky, there should be a better way.\r\n\r\nAlso I am thinking about implementing some bundler (webpack/parcel/rollup) to combine all the js files into one which I could then manually import into html as inline script.\r\nAnd maybe even use some framework like react to make my life easier.\r\n\r\nSo my question is, is this approach viable? Are there any better ways to do this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484078/importing-javascript-into-html-inline-script-for-single-file-usage","title":"Importing javascript into html inline script for single file usage"},{"tags":["android","events","drag-and-drop","touch"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1886,"user_id":823321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrwbB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sɐunıɔןɐqɐp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/823321/s%c9%90un%c4%b1%c9%94%d7%9f%c9%90q%c9%90p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571656950,"post_id":58484076,"comment_id":103301321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484076/android-drag-views-anywhere-on-the-layout#comment103301321_58484076"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6873176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7QsHdnJjhyM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJE/dPoMX3Cu144/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"femi mcpd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6873176/femi-mcpd"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1886,"user_id":823321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lrwbB.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sɐunıɔןɐqɐp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/823321/s%c9%90un%c4%b1%c9%94%d7%9f%c9%90q%c9%90p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571657978,"post_id":58484076,"comment_id":103301818,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484076/android-drag-views-anywhere-on-the-layout#comment103301818_58484076"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":6873176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-7QsHdnJjhyM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJE/dPoMX3Cu144/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"femi mcpd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6873176/femi-mcpd"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571652597,"creation_date":1571652597,"question_id":58484076,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484076","body_markdown":"I would like to drag a view to any location on screen\r\n\r\nI have implemented the touch listener and the only problem is that views that precede others in the hierarchy tend to drag them along.

You don&#39;t want to have interface1() method in Class2\r\n\r\nIn case of 1. as Robby Cornelissen mentioned, you can simply provide default implementation in Interface:\r\n\r\n    default void interface1() { /*do default thing*/ }\r\n\r\nIn case of 2. you need to remove the interface1() method from the Interface.\r\n\r\nYou can do that by simple moving definition of method interface1() to Class1 (and any other sublass that needs to have it). but that is not really generic approach.\r\n\r\nBest is to extract for example Interface1 with method interface1() and use that interface in classes that need to have that method.

I was expecting to do the same as I did in the previous example without ammo (userData.velocity.applyQuaternion) but there&#39;s no LinearVelocity in the ammo.js, I can only use getLinearVelocity and setLinearVelocity.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484070/use-vector-applyquaternion-or-similar-in-ammo-js","title":"Use &quot; vector.applyQuaternion &quot; or similar in ammo.js"},{"tags":["html","css","html-lists"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571653772,"post_id":58484069,"comment_id":103299834,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484069/align-the-last-li-at-the-bottom-of-the-container#comment103299834_58484069"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12041979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqY9v9PutL6B31wQaFomqyWu6RfHp9Oq0uftF0Ng=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Tacchino Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041979/tacchino-robot"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571654370,"post_id":58484069,"comment_id":103300102,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484069/align-the-last-li-at-the-bottom-of-the-container#comment103300102_58484069"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12041979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqY9v9PutL6B31wQaFomqyWu6RfHp9Oq0uftF0Ng=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Tacchino Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041979/tacchino-robot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571654121,"post_id":58484162,"comment_id":103300000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484069/align-the-last-li-at-the-bottom-of-the-container/58484162#comment103300000_58484162"},{"owner":{"reputation":489,"user_id":7179235,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eBeB37MmK-U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKw/pIASSna04UE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oriol Grau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7179235/oriol-grau"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12041979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqY9v9PutL6B31wQaFomqyWu6RfHp9Oq0uftF0Ng=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Tacchino Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041979/tacchino-robot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571656685,"post_id":58484162,"comment_id":103301183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484069/align-the-last-li-at-the-bottom-of-the-container/58484162#comment103301183_58484162"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":489,"user_id":7179235,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eBeB37MmK-U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKw/pIASSna04UE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Oriol Grau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7179235/oriol-grau"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571652950,"creation_date":1571652950,"answer_id":58484162,"question_id":58484069,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58484162","body_markdown":"```css\r\n/* the container */\r\n.table-1 {\r\n  position: relative;\r\n}\r\n\r\nli:last-of-type {\r\n  position: absolute;\r\n  right: 0;\r\n  bottom: 0;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484069/align-the-last-li-at-the-bottom-of-the-container/58484162#58484162","title":"Align the last li at the bottom of the container"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12041979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqY9v9PutL6B31wQaFomqyWu6RfHp9Oq0uftF0Ng=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Tacchino Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041979/tacchino-robot"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12041979,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAqY9v9PutL6B31wQaFomqyWu6RfHp9Oq0uftF0Ng=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Tacchino Robot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041979/tacchino-robot"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58484162,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571654681,"creation_date":1571652564,"last_edit_date":1571654681,"question_id":58484069,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484069","body_markdown":"I can&#39;t figure out how I can align the last `&lt;li&gt;` element at the bottom of the container.

I have other azure web applications that submit posts and dont have this issue.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484063/http-error-403-60-forbidden-when-posting-form-on-azure-web-app","title":"HTTP Error 403.60 - Forbidden When posting form on azure web app"},{"tags":["firebase","flutter","firebase-storage"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571669293,"post_id":58484301,"comment_id":103307979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484060/how-to-init-firebase-storage-image-in-flutter/58484301#comment103307979_58484301"},{"owner":{"reputation":105,"user_id":11674820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOi4E.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"97loser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11674820/97loser"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571677239,"post_id":58484301,"comment_id":103312004,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484060/how-to-init-firebase-storage-image-in-flutter/58484301#comment103312004_58484301"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":105,"user_id":11674820,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JOi4E.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"97loser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11674820/97loser"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571669259,"last_edit_date":1571669259,"creation_date":1571653462,"answer_id":58484301,"question_id":58484060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58484301","body_markdown":"You used unique path every time which create unique child for the database.\r\nSo instead, use static path.\r\n\r\n   e.g -&gt; profile.jpg \r\n\r\n    FirebaseStorage.instance.ref().child(&#39;profile.jpg&#39;);\r\n     \r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484060/how-to-init-firebase-storage-image-in-flutter/58484301#58484301","title":"how to init firebase storage image in flutter"}],"owner":{"reputation":54,"user_id":12061705,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RjPjMWvA8b0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfkwKxovdfL78bZZsLgQ3QDxNCAcA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"killer whale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061705/killer-whale"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571669259,"creation_date":1571652534,"last_edit_date":1571669223,"question_id":58484060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484060","body_markdown":"I am using the FirebaseStorage\r\n\r\nI have already implemented uploading image files to storage.\r\n\r\nUploading image file is profile picture, but whenever I change profile picture, I do not want to have existing image file, so I want to reset every time I upload it.\r\n\r\nBecause I think it is a waste of space.\r\n\r\nhow to init firebase storage?

The curly braces signify [`sets`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#set). And `set()` call converts the `list` to a `set`. Just like `[]` is used for `list`, `()` is used for `tuple`, `{}` is used for `set` and `dictionary`. \r\nA difference between `set` and `dictionary` is:\r\n```\r\n# set\r\ns = {1,2,3}\r\n# dictionary\r\nd = {&#39;a&#39;:1, &#39;b&#39;:2, &#39;c&#39;:3}\r\n```\r\nSo dictionary are collection of values with unique keys. \r\n`sets` are collection of unordered unique elements, very handy for membership checking, and are normally faster than list methods in these cases. I would suggest you to look up `sets`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484048/get-the-remaining-value-from-list-of-possible-values-inline-if-possible/58484100#58484100","title":"Get the remaining value from list of possible values (inline if possible)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":11895782,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jaT9tmKshLY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAJI/MafLaF4QbFQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kostas Charitidis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11895782/kostas-charitidis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571652948,"creation_date":1571652948,"answer_id":58484161,"question_id":58484048,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58484161","body_markdown":"This could also work for you:\r\n\r\n    stacks = [0, 1, 2]\r\n    stack_s = int(input(&#39;stack_s&#39;))\r\n    stack_t = int(input(&#39;stack_t&#39;))\r\n    stack_h = [x for x in stacks if x not in [stack_s, stack_t]][0]\r\n    print(stack_h)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58484048/get-the-remaining-value-from-list-of-possible-values-inline-if-possible/58484161#58484161","title":"Get the remaining value from list of possible values (inline if possible)"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":6142080,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8c4b754f8298c4a97823f3a3f8d6b06?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Houkouha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6142080/houkouha"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58484100,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571653561,"creation_date":1571652495,"question_id":58484048,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58484048","body_markdown":"I have 3 integers in a list (0,1,2) and ask the user to set these values to 3 different objects.
