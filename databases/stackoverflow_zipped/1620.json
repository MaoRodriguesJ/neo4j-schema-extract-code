website has a feature where users can look at each other&#39;s profile pages, but at the moment, I have a problem where the currently logged in user&#39;s information is being displayed across all the profile pages.\r\n\r\nThis is the code for the views.py view_profile\r\n```python\r\n\r\ndef view_profile(request,pk=None):\r\n    if pk:\r\n        user = User.objects.get(pk=pk)\r\n    else:\r\n        user = request.user\r\n    args = {&#39;user&#39;:user}\r\n    return render(request,&#39;mainapp/profile.html&#39;)\r\n```\r\nAnd here are the urls.py\r\n```python\r\npath(&#39;profile/&#39;,views.view_profile,name=&#39;view_profile&#39;),\r\n    path(&#39;profile/&lt;pk&gt;/&#39;,views.view_profile,name=&#39;view_profile_with_pk&#39;),\r\n```\r\nAnd here is the ```UserProfileInfo``` model\r\n```python\r\nclass UserProfileInfo(models.Model):\r\n    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50,blank=True,null=True)\r\n    last_name =

super().save(*args, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried all sorts of things including switching different things around etc.\r\n\r\nSo for the rest of the code that is relevant to this problem, here is the actual template that is rendering this information\r\n```html\r\n{% extends &#39;mainapp/base.html&#39; %}\r\n{% load static %}\r\n{% block content %}\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;{{ user

for the user to be able to look at other people&#39;s pages and view the other users details, not their own. At the moment, the currently logged in user&#39;s details are the only ones being displayed at all, however I want it so that the profile displays information the owner of the profile gives\r\n\r\nThank you for any help, and just let me know if you need any clarification on anything or more code :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157113/template-renders-the-same-information-for-every-user-django","title":"Template renders the same information for every user Django"},{"tags":["javascript","vue.js","webpack","sass","babel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5763,"user_id":3499595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1BWZV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yuriy636","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3499595/yuriy636"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569775237,"post_id":58157112,"comment_id":102696984,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157112/how-do-i-create-a-simple-vue-project-without-a-big-app-js-file#comment102696984_58157112"},{"owner":{"reputation":3607,"user_id":1992973,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db685171da6ffe8e4dc300c15142d221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HartleySan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1992973/hartleysan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5763,"user_id":3499595,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1BWZV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yuriy636","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3499595/yuriy636"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569775649,"post_id":58157112,"comment_id":102697105,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157112/how-do-i-create-a-simple-vue-project-without-a-big-app-js-file#comment102697105_58157112"},{"owner":{"reputation":816,"user_id":11641932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d215317b61fdd2eab82558eda526074d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MarcRo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11641932/marcro"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569777477,"post_id":58157112,"comment_id":102697594,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157112/how-do-i-create-a-simple-vue-project-without-a-big-app-js-file#comment102697594_58157112"},{"owner":{"reputation":3607,"user_id":1992973,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db685171da6ffe8e4dc300c15142d221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HartleySan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1992973/hartleysan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569778314,"post_id":58157112,"comment_id":102697799,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157112/how-do-i-create-a-simple-vue-project-without-a-big-app-js-file#comment102697799_58157112"}],"owner":{"reputation":3607,"user_id":1992973,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db685171da6ffe8e4dc300c15142d221?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"HartleySan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1992973/hartleysan"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569774469,"creation_date":1569774469,"question_id":58157112,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157112","body_markdown":"I want to create a Vue app, so I started by using the Vue CLI to do so, but the app.js bundle is 1.2 MB before I&#39;ve even really done anything.

evening everyone. I am a newby in game programming, and I would like to receive some help. \r\nSo I have created a list of round shapes.  I will post just some rough lines of the code, to give you an idea.\r\n\r\n        class ShapeCircle\r\n          {\r\n       sf::CircleShape circle;\r\n      //sf::Vector2f position;\r\n     //and the other things\r\n        }\r\n   \r\n           struct Node\r\n           {\r\n            ShapeOfCircle circle;\r\n            node*next;\r\n           }\r\n\r\n     class listCircles\r\n     {\r\n    private:\r\n    *node head;\r\n      public:\r\n     //the other methods\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd until here everything is okay. Now what I would like to do is to create another list in which, each node, contains a list. \r\n\r\n    struct Node2\r\n    {\r\n     listCircles ListOfCircles;\r\n      Node2*next;\r\n      }\r\nAnd same, we have this second list.\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is to create new circles, if the player moves to the right, and if the player moves to the left should be able to see the &quot;old screen&quot;.\r\nLet&#39;s say I have a list of (4, 5, 3, 3);\r\nThe first time I open the screen there is the player who sees 4 circles, then the player moves to the right of the screen and (pacman effect, the player goes beyond and is back again) I should be able to see 5, then if the player moves again 3, but if the player goes backwards, I should be able to see 5.\r\n\r\nIs there a way that I can do this? I tried to save the position of the circles in a file, and trying to read ( a complicated thing) but it didn&#39;t work, that&#39;s why I am sort of sticking with lists (I am not allowed to use any libraries)\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions?

guess that stopThread has the initial value of false, which causes your 2nd loop not to be executed and the threads terminates. \r\n\r\nInstead of using a loop you could share some lock object between both buttons, and use wait and notify instead. Check [`this tutorial`][1].\r\n\r\nA possible Implementation could look like this:\r\n\r\nBoth buttons need access to these two variables:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nObject lock = new Object();\r\nvolatile boolean stopThread = false;\r\n```\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThe `onClick` method of the first button:\r\n```\r\npublic void onClick(View view) {\r\n\r\n\tnew Thread(new Runnable() {\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void run() {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// execute my task\r\n\r\n\t\t\tsynchronized (lock) {\r\n\t\t\t\t// stopThread is a volatile boolean changed by another button click\r\n\t\t\t\twhile (stopThread == false) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tlock.wait();\r\n\t\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// Finish the task\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}).start();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThe `onClick` method of the second button:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic void onClick(View view) {\r\n\r\n\tnew Thread(new Runnable() {\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic void run() {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tsynchronized (lock) {\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tstopThread = true;\r\n\t\t\t\tlock.notify();\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}).start();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will want to keep the boolean flag around to handle `spurious wakeups`. If the condition is fullfilled you continue with your code, else you go back to wait for the notification.\r\n\r\nNote that the example does not deal with any interrupts that may happen.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou might want to use `AsyncTask.execute` instead of starting Threads on your own.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nCheck this [`answer`][2].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.baeldung.com/java-wait-notify\r\n[2]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/31549559/11514534\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157095/thread-seems-to-kill-itself-after-a-while/58157709#58157709","title":"Thread seems to kill itself after a while?"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":9878032,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/83f62a4f186cb0827e6c3309221e0fed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hyung Duc Da","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9878032/hyung-duc-da"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58157709,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569780273,"creation_date":1569774344,"question_id":58157095,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157095","body_markdown":"I&#39;m very new into Threads and I&#39;m facing following problem when using a thread in my code.\r\n\r\nOn a button click I&#39;m starting a thread which runs a specific task, and this task is running in the background of the system.

far as I know there&#39;s not really any way to do this easily but I could be wrong.  There are &quot;portable&quot; versions of python but these are operating system dependent. I think what you&#39;re referencing is some guys at PyCon managed to run python from the GRUB Bootloader.  Your best bet would be installing some minimalist Linux distribution, with essentially only Python and some core packages required to run.  The problem is that there&#39;s a lot of types of hardware out there, all with their own drivers and assembly language.  Python can work as a low level language when you need it to but it seems like configuration would be a nightmare.  I haven&#39;t looked into it super thoroughly but it seems difficult and impractical. Having an OS above python gives you access to the package managers IDEs and compilier options that make python worth using.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157080/how-do-i-run-python-without-an-os/58157170#58157170","title":"How do I run python without an OS"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":457,"user_id":10294519,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3017194941d107475a11262954452f35?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wishmaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10294519/wishmaster"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570262465,"post_id":58246450,"comment_id":102864267,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157080/how-do-i-run-python-without-an-os/58246450#comment102864267_58246450"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10637919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dane P","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10637919/dane-p"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570262140,"creation_date":1570262140,"answer_id":58246450,"question_id":58157080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58246450","body_markdown":"yea that&#39;s one of the options, pretty much all the &quot;light&quot; distros will be similar, if you want more to try out try [here](https://itsfoss.com/lightweight-linux-beginners/).

To get `git filter-branch` to copy (and filter) commits that are reachable from both names `A` and `B` but not to copy+filter commits that are reachable from `master`, use the syntax:\r\n\r\n    git filter-branch &lt;options&gt; -- ^master A B\r\n\r\nWhat we&#39;re doing here, with the `git rev-list` arguments `^master A B`, is telling Git: *Find all commits reachable from either `A` or `B`, excluding all commits reachable from `master`*.  So if the commit chains go:\r\n\r\n    ...--o--o--o   &lt;-- master\r\n                \\\r\n                 o--o--o   &lt;-- A\r\n                        \\\r\n                         o--o   &lt;-- B\r\n\r\nfor instance, this selects the middle and bottom row commits.  It would even with `^master B` or `master..B`, as in [phd&#39;s answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58157395/1256452), but this is better for two reasons.  First, it would still select all middle-row commits with:\r\n\r\n    ...--o--o--o   &lt;-- master\r\n                \\\r\n                 o--o--o   &lt;-- A\r\n                     \\\r\n                      o--o   &lt;-- B\r\n\r\n(although this is presumably not your structure).  Second, *after* copying (and filtering) the specified commits such that you wind up with:\r\n\r\n                         o--o   &lt;-- [filtered copy of commit to which B points]\r\n                        /\r\n                 o--o--o   [filtered copy of commit to which A points]\r\n                /\r\n    ...--o--o--o   &lt;-- master\r\n                \\\r\n                 o--o--o   &lt;-- A\r\n                        \\\r\n                         o--o   &lt;-- B\r\n\r\nthe filter-branch command will move all of what [the documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-filter-branch) calls *positive references*.  A positive reference is one that does not have a negation in front of it: in this case, `A` and `B`, but not `master`, as `master` is written `^master` and is therefore a negative reference.\r\n\r\nHence this won&#39;t touch `master` (not that it would anyway—its commit did not get copied) but *will* yank the names `A` and `B` over so that they point to the copied commits.\r\n\r\nNote that if you don&#39;t want changes made to the snapshots in the two (in this example) `B`-only commits, it is up to you to write a clever filter that does that.  (Or to use a filter that makes no tree changes, but by &quot;reformat&quot; I assume you want to use `--tree-filter` and something like `clang-format` on the *snapshots* in each of the various `A` commits.  It&#39;s probably more sensible to go ahead and make the same formatting changes to the various `B` commits as well.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157067/how-to-reformat-multiple-branches-at-once-in-git/58157576#58157576","title":"How to reformat multiple branches at once in Git?"}],"owner":{"reputation":584,"user_id":188046,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/183ec81bfdbe6442a896a43223281177?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elliott Slaughter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/188046/elliott-slaughter"},"last_editor":{"reputation":584,"user_id":188046,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/183ec81bfdbe6442a896a43223281177?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Elliott Slaughter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/188046/elliott-slaughter"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58157576,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569778126,"creation_date":1569774184,"last_edit_date":1569774517,"question_id":58157067,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157067","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s suppose I&#39;ve got a branch structure in Git that looks like `master -&gt; A -&gt; B`.

Hence, you have multiple work-groups in-flight in the same CU at the same time, to maximize pipeline efficiency. If your design uses local-memory-based buffers, when you check the HTML report, you will see that the compiler is further replicating those buffers to support a specific number of &quot;Simultaneous Work-groups&quot;. The number of such work-groups seems to be equal to pipeline depth per CU divided by work-group size. In the end, all work-item from all work-groups running simultaneously in the same CU are pipelined one after another, with work-items belonging to each CU using their own local buffers, and barrier synchronization being enforced per work-group.

E.g.:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\nconst app = new Vue({\r\n  el:&#39;#app&#39;,\r\n  data: {\r\n    exercises: {},\r\n  },\r\n  mounted() {\r\n    this.exercises = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(&quot;exercises&quot;));\r\n  },\r\n  watch: {\r\n    exercises(newExerciseValues) {\r\n      localStorage.setItem(&quot;exercises&quot;, JSON.stringify(newExerciseValues));\r\n    },\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you really need to store and retrieve the individual exercises explicitly, I would recommend keeping the data in one `exercises` object, and simply use a `for` loop to check/set everything. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n[...]\r\nwatch: {\r\n  exercises(newExercises) {\r\n    const exercisesToCheck = [\r\n      &#39;explosive_pullups_1&#39;,\r\n      &#39;explosive_pullups_2&#39;,\r\n      &#39;explosive_pullups_3&#39;,\r\n      &#39;tuck_front_raises_1&#39;,\r\n      &#39;tuck_front_raises_2&#39;,\r\n      &#39;tuck_front_raises_3&#39;,\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    for (const exercise of exercisesToCheck) {\r\n      localStorage.setItem(exercise, this.exercises[exercise]);\r\n    }\r\n  },\r\n},\r\n[...]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn a side note, be very careful when working with objects in Vue. If you need to add a new exercise to the `exercises` object, avoid using `this.exercises[&#39;new_exercise&#39;] = newExercise`. Instead, use `Vue.set(this.exercises, &#39;new_exercise&#39;, newExercise)`. Check out the [Vue docs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html#Change-Detection-Caveats) for an explanation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157049/how-can-i-write-this-code-to-be-more-efficient/58157092#58157092","title":"How can I write this code to be more

Even if Django itself doesn&#39;t break anything, some dependency it has might be able to.\r\n\r\nAnother advantage is that you can always run ```pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt``` in your environment to list all installed packages and versions, then ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in another environment. This makes package import and versioning effortless when you move among development machines or between development and production, and helpful if you&#39;d ever like to roll your own package.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157047/i-am-not-able-to-access-django-inside-virtual-environment/58160650#58160650","title":"I am not able to access django inside virtual environment"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12098598,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDloZ9g7TYQTsbxLf_Eieck31-tT5v1RrsZYOptDg=k-s128","display_name":"Shoreya Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12098598/shoreya-gupta"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569808561,"creation_date":1569774008,"last_edit_date":1569786571,"question_id":58157047,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58157047","body_markdown":"If I install django on local system, then that django, if I access in virtual environment, will that be accessible, or I have to install django again in VirtualEnvironment?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157047/i-am-not-able-to-access-django-inside-virtual-environment","title":"I am not able to access django inside virtual environment"},{"tags":["sql","oracle","sqlplus"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569774202,"post_id":58157046,"comment_id":102696717,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157046/not-getting-all-the-column-in-a-single-line-one-column-displaying-down-even-tho#comment102696717_58157046"},{"owner":{"reputation":34290,"user_id":3484879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ot5kT.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Larnu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3484879/larnu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569774209,"post_id":58157046,"comment_id":102696718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157046/not-getting-all-the-column-in-a-single-line-one-column-displaying-down-even-tho#comment102696718_58157046"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6260,"user_id":3627756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JxLDj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ankit Bajpai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3627756/ankit-bajpai"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569780207,"post_id":58157695,"comment_id":102698203,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157046/not-getting-all-the-column-in-a-single-line-one-column-displaying-down-even-tho/58157695#comment102698203_58157695"},{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11417290,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c04962ce075689539c9f8fbbb6732faa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Irfan Ansari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11417290/irfan-ansari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569787406,"post_id":58157695,"comment_id":102699893,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157046/not-getting-all-the-column-in-a-single-line-one-column-displaying-down-even-tho/58157695#comment102699893_58157695"},{"owner":{"reputation":36386,"user_id":9097906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RmIqt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Littlefoot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9097906/littlefoot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569788783,"post_id":58157695,"comment_id":102700213,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58157046/not-getting-all-the-column-in-a-single-line-one-column-displaying-down-even-tho/58157695#comment102700213_58157695"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36386,"user_id":9097906,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RmIqt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Littlefoot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9097906/littlefoot"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569778955,"creation_date":1569778955,"answer_id":58157695,"question_id":58157046,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58157695","body_markdown":"Regarding table contents, we&#39;re talking about Oracle and SQL*Plus command line tool and Scott&#39;s sample schema (its EMP table).\r\n\r\nThis is what you have now:\r\n\r\n    SQL&gt;

You could think of these in a similar way as strings: you can not alter a string, you can only make a (modified) copy of the string. Strictly speaking, you can alter the state of a `QuerySet`, but that is usually *not* a good idea, by changing values hold by the `QuerySet` (and the underlying `.query`), it is likely that you will break some assumption, and thus construct an invalid query, or defeat the caching mechanism.\r\n\r\nYou thus should construct a queryset like:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def vote(request):\r\n    persons = Person.objects.all()\r\n    transactions = Transaction.objects.&lt;b&gt;order_by(&#39;date&#39;)&lt;/b&gt;\r\n    return render(\r\n        request,\r\n        &#39;liste.html&#39;,\r\n        {&#39;persons&#39;: persons, &#39;transactions&#39;: transaction}\r\n    )&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\n&gt; **Extra notes**:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 1. since `person` is a collection of `Person`s, it is better to name it &lt;code&gt;person&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;s&gt;`person`&lt;/s&gt;.\r\n&gt; 2. please do not use `locals()` this is an anti-pattern, since you make it unclear what you pass to the context. If you later aim to optimize the view for example, you might remove some variable by mistake.

is because your struct is empty, there is no members.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the dictionary considers they are the same, like if `null`.\r\n\r\nAnd Key of Dictionary must be unique.\r\n\r\nI notice that the compiler doesn&#39;t throw a non assignment error... that it throws if the struct have members...\r\n\r\nFor the type of blood you can use an enum like that, no need to create a struct or a class that are for encapsulating data structure, because enum are enumarated integers values (like parameters or lists of states):\r\n\r\n    public enum BlooType\r\n    {\r\n      O,\r\n      A,\r\n      B,\r\n      AB\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere O = 0, A = 1, B = 2 and AB = 3\r\n\r\nPerhaps you need that if I understand, to made the thing simple:\r\n\r\n    public enum BlooType\r\n    {\r\n      Op,  // = 0\r\n      Om,\r\n      Bp,\r\n      Bm,\r\n      Ap,\r\n      Am,\r\n      ABp,\r\n      ABm  // = 7\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd rhesus : \r\n\r\n    public enum Rhesus\r\n    {\r\n      Positive,\r\n      Negative\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere an explanation of what enum are and how to use them:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tutorialspoint.com/csharp/csharp_enums.htm\r\n\r\nNow you can write:\r\n\r\n    dic.Add(BloodType.ABp, new List&lt;BloodType&gt; { BloodType.Op, BloodType.Om ... });\r\n\r\nTo get a readable string of a blood type you can write for example:\r\n\r\n    string strType =

My plan was to take out the elements of each list and save them into a variable. And in the end to put the variables together, so that there is just a flat list at the end.  \r\n\r\nI have two problems:\r\n\r\n1. The index-3 element (`&#39;99999&#39;`) isn&#39;t saved as a whole in the list of the new variable. This problem is the topic of this question.\r\n\r\n2. I cannot separate the nested list `[66, 77, 88]` from the higher list [&#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;,[]], but this is *not* the topic of this question\r\n\r\nSo here is the code of the nested list and of my if statement:\r\n\r\n```python-3.7\r\nnested_list = [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;99999&#39;,[&#39;4&#39;, &#39;5&#39;,[66, 77, 88]]]\r\ny = []\r\nfor i in nested_list:\r\n    if type(i) != (list or tuple):\r\n        y += i\r\nprint(y)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want the index=3 element (the string `&#39;99999&#39;`) be saved in the variable `y` as a whole string and not split into the single parts `&#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;`\r\n\r\nI want:\r\n\r\n```python-3.7\r\nprint(y)\r\n[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;99999&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(y)\r\n[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t solve the problem with saving into a string (`y = &#39; &#39;`), because than I get the result:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(y)\r\n12399999\r\n```\r\n\r\nand if I would transform the string to a list\r\n\r\n```\r\ny = list(y)\r\n```\r\nI get the same unwanted result\r\n\r\n```\r\n[&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;3&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;, &#39;9&#39;]\r\n```\r\nI think the solution lies in the action code after the if-statement\r\n\r\n```\r\ny += i\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a command, which takes the whole element into `y`? I tried `y += sum(i)` but of course this didn&#39;t work, because \r\n\r\n1. it adds up all numbers like int, floats, etc.., not strings\r\n\r\n2. I don&#39;t need to add `9+9+9+9+9=45`, but I need just the whole string in my new list `y`.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156977/how-to-save-an-element-from-a-list-as-a-whole-after-an-if-statement","title":"How to save an element from a list as a whole after an

The difference between reserved, dedicated, spot and on-demand has more to do with cost than availability. AFAIK AWS does not guarantee different levels of availability for different EC2 instance types or cost structures.\r\n\r\nDedicated instances are ones that won&#39;t run on the same hardware as other instances, but dedicated instances can run on the same hardware as other non-dedicated instances in the same account. Dedicated instances shouldn&#39;t have any affect on availability.\r\n\r\nThe other options, (reserved, spot and on-demand) are just different cost structures. They don&#39;t affect performance or availability.\r\n\r\nAWS advertises 99.99% uptime. This is from their SLA:\r\n\r\n&gt; AWS will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Included Services each available for each AWS region with a Monthly Uptime Percentage of at least 99.99%, in each case during any monthly billing cycle (the “Service Commitment”). In the event any of the Included Services do not meet the Service Commitment, you will be eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, any instance will be appropriate for important long running apps, you just need to select the instance type that is large enough and pick the right cost structure. You probably don&#39;t need dedicated instances, unless you have determined that steel time is going to impact your app&#39;s performance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156972/for-long-running-important-apps-what-aws-ec2-instance-type-select/58157072#58157072","title":"For long running important apps what Aws EC2 instance type select?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1070,"user_id":4438168,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e9282ce2f9d4b8a30842db7419804fc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MisterSmith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4438168/mistersmith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569784127,"creation_date":1569784127,"answer_id":58158368,"question_id":58156972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58158368","body_markdown":"I dont think its Instance Types you need to worry about - they are just different sizes of machines that have different ratios of CPU/RAM/IO. High-Availability can only be achieved by designing it into both the application and infrastructure. Reservation Types (spot/on-demand/dedicated) are more about cost optimisation based on how long and much capacity you need.\r\n\r\nSpot instances are transient - you can reserve a spot for upto 6 hours then it will be terminated. Probably not a good fit, but it depends on how long is &quot;long running&quot;? You get a significant discount for using spot instances if you can live with the limitations. \r\n\r\nOn-Demand and Reserved are basically the same service, but on-demand is pay-as-you-go vs reserved instance is a fixed length contract and upfront payments. Reserved instances give you the best value for money over the long term, but on-demand gives you flexibility to change instance size or turn off the instance to save money.\r\n\r\nGoing shared vs Dedicated is generally a compliance question as it gets a lot more expensive to reserve your own hardware to run just your own instances.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156972/for-long-running-important-apps-what-aws-ec2-instance-type-select/58158368#58158368","title":"For long running important apps what Aws EC2 instance type select?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12139148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3faede60809cf887a3684d6c9a1b734b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Djurasico","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139148/djurasico"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569784127,"creation_date":1569773363,"question_id":58156972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156972","body_markdown":"I have been checking all EC2 instances and.. from all types I&#39;m debating between choosing -reserved instance or dedicated instance-\r\n\r\nSpot and on demand doesn&#39;t meet the requirement I think.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t have more information about the type of app to be run.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156972/for-long-running-important-apps-what-aws-ec2-instance-type-select","title":"For long running important apps what Aws EC2 instance type select?"},{"tags":["html","css","iframe","css-grid"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":81104,"user_id":2802040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCB9I.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paulie_D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2802040/paulie-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569942527,"post_id":58156969,"comment_id":102755185,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156969/iframe-in-css-grid-layout-resizes-on-it-s-own#comment102755185_58156969"},{"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":11831068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/968c3b2680b25e986ae04ec2a1d04a33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Perhaps you see this name.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831068/perhaps-you-see-this-name"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":81104,"user_id":2802040,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bCB9I.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Paulie_D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2802040/paulie-d"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570042238,"post_id":58156969,"comment_id":102793207,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156969/iframe-in-css-grid-layout-resizes-on-it-s-own#comment102793207_58156969"}],"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":11831068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/968c3b2680b25e986ae04ec2a1d04a33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Perhaps you see this name.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831068/perhaps-you-see-this-name"},"last_editor":{"reputation":124,"user_id":11831068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/968c3b2680b25e986ae04ec2a1d04a33?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Perhaps you see this name.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11831068/perhaps-you-see-this-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570042865,"creation_date":1569773334,"last_edit_date":1570042865,"question_id":58156969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156969","body_markdown":"I am attempting to make a miniture browser in a browser, and i’m working on the layout in css.

my view controller namely &quot;HomeViewController&quot; basically displays a **label** and two buttons, **connect** and **logout**.\r\n\r\nOnce the view is loaded, my label basically has a background colour of **white** and a text that says **&quot;Press the connect button&quot;**. When I press the **connect** button, the label changes the text to **&quot;Please wait, waiting to connect you with someone&quot;** and the background colour changes to **yellow**. Then I perform some firebase queries and connect the user with someone. Once connected, I change the label colour to **green** and text to **&quot;You have now been connected&quot;**.\r\n\r\nEverything works just fine except that I have two issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. When the view loads, I am calling a function ```fetchUserDet()``` that fetches user details and stores it in a declared object ```User```. I use this ```User``` object to access details of the currently logged in user, details like name, age etc. When I logout and login as a different user however, the ```User``` object just fails to get the details of the newly logged in user and returns nil.\r\n\r\n Temporary fix: I am calling the ```fetchUserDet()``` function yet again in a ```viewWillAppear()``` function but I guess this is bad practice but gets the job done. Now my ```User``` object is assigned to the newly logged in user\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Say I press the connect button, the label changes colour and text as expected but when I log this user out and login as a different user, the label and text remains in the state as it was for the previous user. Ex: Logged in as **user 1** and press **connect** button, label changes colour to **yellow** and text to **&quot;Please wait, waiting to connect you with someone&quot;**. When I logout and login as **user 2**, it remains in the same state as **yellow** and **&quot;Please wait, waiting to connect you with someone&quot;**\r\n\r\nI am guessing both these bugs are interconnected and I am definitely doing something wrong here. I am using **Firestore**.

Instead, Postman recovers the code and uses it to obtain the access token directly from the Resource server.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\r\n  |          User Device          |\r\n  |                               |\r\n  | +--------------------------+  | (5) Authorization  +---------------+\r\n  | |                          |  |     Code           |               |\r\n  | |        Client App        |----------------------&gt;|     Token     |\r\n  | |                          |&lt;----------------------|    Endpoint   |\r\n  | +--------------------------+  | (6) Access Token,  |               |\r\n  |   |             ^             |     Refresh Token  +---------------+\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   | (1)         | (4)         |\r\n  |   | Authorizat- | Authoriza-  |\r\n  |   | ion Request | tion Code   |\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   v             |             |\r\n  | +---------------------------+ | (2) Authorization  +---------------+\r\n  | |                           | |     Request        |               |\r\n  | |          Browser          |---------------------&gt;| Authorization |\r\n  | |                           |&lt;---------------------|    Endpoint   |\r\n  | +---------------------------+ | (3) Authorization  |               |\r\n  |                               |     Code           +---------------+\r\n  +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\r\n```\r\nSource: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8252#section-4.1\r\n\r\nThe request flow in Postman looks like the following instead\r\n\r\n```\r\n  +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\r\n  |          User Device          |\r\n  |                               |\r\n  | +--------------------------+  | (3) Authorization  +---------------+\r\n  | |                          |  |     Code           |               |\r\n  | |        Postman           |----------------------&gt;|     Token     |\r\n  | |                          |&lt;----------------------|    Endpoint   |\r\n  | +--------------------------+  | (4) Access Token,  |               |\r\n  |   |             ^             |     Refresh Token  +---------------+\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   |             |             |\r\n  |   | (1)         | (2)         |\r\n  |   | Authorizat- | Authoriza-  |\r\n  |   | ion Request | tion Code   |\r\n  |   |             |             |        +---------------+\r\n  |   |             |             |        |               |\r\n  |   |             &#39;---------------------&gt;| Authorization |\r\n  |   &#39;------------------------------------|    Endpoint   |\r\n  |                               |        |               |\r\n  |                               |        +---------------+\r\n  +~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Postman will therefore open a connection to the authorization endpoint and\r\n2. send an HTTP GET request looking like the following.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGET /authorize?prompt=login&amp;response_type=code&amp;state=&lt;STATE&gt;&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;REDIRECT_URI&gt;&amp;client_id=&lt;CLIENT_ID&gt; HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: AUTHORIZATION_SERVER_URL\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. The authorization will respond with a login form which Postman will show you.\r\n4. You enter your credentials and Postman replies with a POST request with your credentials.\r\n5. The server sends a response with a 302 redirect such as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\r\nLocation: &lt;REDIRECT_URI&gt;?code=&lt;CODE&gt;\r\n&amp;state=&lt;STATE&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Postman now, **instead of redirecting you to the redirect uri** sends a POST request with the code it obtained in the response to the token endpoint with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPOST /token HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: AUTHORIZATION_SERVER\r\nAuthorization: Basic &lt;CLIENT_SECRET_IF_CONFIDENTIAL_CLIENT&gt;\r\n...\r\ngrant_type=authorization_code&amp;code=&lt;CODE&gt;\r\n&amp;redirect_uri=&lt;REDIRECT_URI&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. The authorization server responds with the token, a signed base64 encoded json object, which Postman can display for you.\r\n\r\nThe whole process is described here: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1 There are a few variations (implicit flow, confidential or public code flow) on this process for different constraints (SPA, full stack websites, native apps), but they all function similarly.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, Postman offers the convenience of immediately getting the token and embedding it and is widely use for development purposes. However, many other native apps do similar this, and even websites will handle the authentication in an IFrame which opens the door to malicious use, but also trains users to enter their credentials even in untrusted settings. One of the security advantages of following the suggested workflow is that the application never gets the credentials, and the browser enforces that only the website referred to in the redirect response get to obtain the code. This prevents a malicious app from stealing your credentials (in step 4 above) since the login happens on the authorization server with a trusted user-agent (your browser).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156957/how-postman-complete-the-oauth-2-0-flow-without-actually-redirect-to-the-redirec/58174416#58174416","title":"How postman complete the OAuth 2.0 flow without actually redirect to the RedirectURL(callbackUrl)?"}],"owner":{"reputation":256,"user_id":4755053,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10206535481490822/picture?type=large","display_name":"ykn121","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4755053/ykn121"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569955455,"creation_date":1569773275,"question_id":58156957,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156957","body_markdown":"I am currently trying to integrate MQL5 login to my mobile app using react native.\r\n\r\nThere are not much example to learn how to integrate it.

keep in mind that PEP8 is a *guide*, not a *prescription*. Practically speaking Python code is valid as long as it meets the language specification. In practice, I would say &quot;as long as CPython doesn&#39;t complain, it&#39;s OK&quot;.\r\n\r\nUse an program like [`yapf`](https://pypi.org/project/yapf/) or [`black`](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to format your Python code. That way you don&#39;t have to worry about the details. Set up a shortcut in your editor to call the formatter, or call it automatically before you check in a file in your revision control software.\r\n\r\nI would suggest setting the acceptable line length for those tools to a value around 90. The outdated 79 character limit in PEP8 comes from low resolution monitors (and going back to hardware terminals and teletypes) that are hardly relevant today. Strictly adhering to this limit in modern Python code with list comprehensions and f-strings can actually make your code *less* readable.

If you have spaces as separator, gnuplot will not recognize the columns as you expect. So, either make sure your separator is tab (`&quot;\\t&quot;`).

Alternatively, insert some symbol, e.g. `?`, to make it clear what the columns are.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you don&#39;t have to type `UCl-AgCl.dat` 6 times, 1 times is enough,  `&#39;&#39;` is plotting from the last used file.\r\n\r\nThe image below is from wxt terminal generated with gnuplot 5.2.6.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Data:** `UCl3-AgCl.dat`\r\n\r\n    # EMF data of UCl3 in LiCl-KCl eutectic melt\r\n    # using 1 and 5 wt.% AgCl \r\n    # Composition of UCl3: 1, 2 and 3 wt.% UCl3 \r\n    # Data set 1: 1 wt.% AgCl \r\n    # Col 1: T1(K) Col 2: EMF1 ( 1 wt.% UCl3), Col 3: T2(K), Col 4: EMF2 (2 wt.% UCl3), Col 5: T3(K), Col 6: EMF3 (3 wt.% UCl3) \r\n    # Data set 2: 5 wt.% AgCl \r\n    # Col 7: T1(K) Col 8: EMF1 ( 1 wt.% UCl3), Col 9: T2(K), Col 10: EMF2 (2 wt.% UCl3), Col 11: T3(K), Col 12: EMF3 (3 wt.% UCl3) \r\n    693   -1.4061   693   -1.3889    673   -1.4061      693   -1.5227    693   -1.5089      673    -1.5232\r\n    673   -1.4202   673   -1.4013    699   -1.3812      673   -1.5320    673   -1.5235      699    -1.4990\r\n    703   -1.3989   699   -1.3859    713   -1.3671      703   -1.5181    699   -1.5057      713    -1.4920\r\n    713   -1.3918   703   -1.3801    683   -1.3947      713   -1.5134    703   -1.5022      683    -1.5144\r\n    683   -1.4135   713   -1.3725    723   -1.3592      683   -1.5278    713   -1.4970      723    -1.4812\r\n    723   -1.3854   683   -1.3992    734   -1.3509      723   -1.5064    683   -1.5169      734    -1.4732\r\n    734   -1.3785   723   -1.3700    743   -1.3470      734   -1.5041    723   -1.4949      743    -1.4670\r\n    743   -1.3702   734   -1.3635    749   -1.3387      743   -1.4983    734   -1.4949      749    -1.4629\r\n    754   -1.3632   743   -1.3559    754   -1.3394      754   -1.4937    743   -1.4849      754    -1.4574\r\n    773   -1.3509   749   -1.3481    773   -1.3086      773   -1.4846    749   -1.4791      773    -1.4363\r\n    783   -1.3437   754   -1.3475    789   -1.2969      783   -1.4797    754   -1.4794      789    -1.4267\r\n      ?         ?   764   -1.3405      ?         ?        ?         ?    764   -1.4746        ?          ?\r\n      ?         ?   773   -1.3332      ?         ?        ?         ?    773   -1.4689        ?          ?\r\n      ?         ?   783   -1.3348      ?         ?        ?         ?    783   -1.4712        ?          ?\r\n      ?         ?   789   -1.3270      ?         ?        ?         ?    789   -1.4651        ?          ?\r\n      ?         ?   799   -1.3217      ?         ?        ?         ?    799   -1.4620        ?          ?\r\n\r\n**Code:**\r\n\r\n    ### &quot;split&quot;

How can I dynamically convert my objects to look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst Op = require(&#39;sequelize&#39;).Op;\r\n\r\nconst whereParams = {\r\n    price: {\r\n        [Op.gt]: 80000,\r\n        [Op.lt]: 120000\r\n    },\r\n    year: 2019\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that I can use them within my `where` property:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrouter.get(&#39;cars&#39;, (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n    Car.findAll({\r\n        where: whereParams\r\n    }).then((cars) =&gt; {\r\n        res.status(200).send(cars);\r\n    })\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t simply hard code the Sequelize objects because this filter parameter is dynamic, thanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156930/how-to-transform-dynamic-query-parameter-object-to-sequelize-operators-javascri","title":"How to transform dynamic query parameter object to Sequelize Operators (Javascript Symbols)"},{"tags":["terraform","terraform-provider-github","terraform-cloud"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":27688,"user_id":2291321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24a41cddd8faf69e3fbd0a778ba6fedf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ydaetskcoR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2291321/ydaetskcor"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569776237,"post_id":58156929,"comment_id":102697251,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156929/terraform-import-fails-with-terraform-cloud-remote-backend#comment102697251_58156929"},{"owner":{"reputation":10191,"user_id":405013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef3cd04888c6d17f34d43e29ec3d46f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"caarlos0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/405013/caarlos0"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":27688,"user_id":2291321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24a41cddd8faf69e3fbd0a778ba6fedf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ydaetskcoR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2291321/ydaetskcor"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569776762,"post_id":58156929,"comment_id":102697408,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156929/terraform-import-fails-with-terraform-cloud-remote-backend#comment102697408_58156929"},{"owner":{"reputation":13715,"user_id":281848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7nJW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Atkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/281848/martin-atkins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569860066,"post_id":58156929,"comment_id":102724324,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156929/terraform-import-fails-with-terraform-cloud-remote-backend#comment102724324_58156929"},{"owner":{"reputation":10191,"user_id":405013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef3cd04888c6d17f34d43e29ec3d46f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"caarlos0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/405013/caarlos0"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13715,"user_id":281848,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/w7nJW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin Atkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/281848/martin-atkins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569873259,"post_id":58156929,"comment_id":102729657,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156929/terraform-import-fails-with-terraform-cloud-remote-backend#comment102729657_58156929"}],"owner":{"reputation":10191,"user_id":405013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ef3cd04888c6d17f34d43e29ec3d46f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"caarlos0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/405013/caarlos0"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569773078,"creation_date":1569773078,"question_id":58156929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156929","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to import an existing github repository to terraform.

--user\r\n```\r\nAs described in the [Jupyter Notebook documentation][1], one could specify in `setup.py`:\r\n```\r\nimport setuptools\r\n\r\nsetuptools.setup(\r\n    name=&quot;MyFancyModule&quot;,\r\n    ...\r\n    include_package_data=True,\r\n    data_files=[\r\n        # like `jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix`\r\n        (&quot;share/jupyter/nbextensions/my_fancy_module&quot;, [\r\n            &quot;my_fancy_module/static/index.js&quot;,\r\n        ]),\r\n        # like `jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix`\r\n        (&quot;etc/jupyter/nbconfig/notebook.d&quot;, [\r\n            &quot;jupyter-config/nbconfig/notebook.d/my_fancy_module.json&quot;\r\n        ])\r\n    ],\r\n    ...\r\n    zip_safe=False\r\n)\r\n```\r\nHowever, when I try to run `pip install .` in the package directory, the installation finishes but `my_fancy_module` is not installed. Running:\r\n```\r\njupyter nbextension install --user &lt;my_fancy_module&gt;\r\n```\r\nworks well, since it correctly copies the whole `&lt;my_fancy_module&gt;` from my package directory inside `~/Library/Jupyter/nbextensions/`.\r\n\r\nAccording to [Python documentation on Installing Additional Files][2]:\r\n&gt;`data_files` specifies a sequence of (directory, files) (...) Each (directory, files) pair in the sequence specifies the installation directory and the files to install there. (...) The directory **should be a relative path**. It is interpreted relative to the installation prefix (Python’s `sys.prefix` for system installations; `site.USER_BASE` for user installations).\r\n\r\nMy `site.USER_BASE` points at `~/.local`.\r\n\r\n**My question is:**\r\n\r\nHow do I install and enable `my_fancy_package` from inside `setup.py` such that I end up with the same result as if I performed the two commands mentioned at the beginning? If this is about specifying `data_files` - what `directory` should I specify tere in order to successfully install and enable `my_fancy_module`?\r\n\r\nI tried:\r\n\r\n`&quot;/Library/Jupyter/nbextensions/my_fancy_module&quot;`, `&quot;../Library/Jupyter/nbextensions/my_fancy_module&quot;`, `&quot;share/jupyter/nbextensions/my_fancy_module&quot;`\r\n\r\nbut none of them worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Distributing%20Jupyter%20Extensions%20as%20Python%20Packages.html#Automatically-enabling-a-server-extension-and-nbextension\r\n  [2]: https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-additional-files","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156901/installation-of-jupyter-extensions-automatic-installation-and-enabling-from-se","title":"Installation of Jupyter Extensions - Automatic installation and enabling from setup.py"},{"tags":["integration"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1344,"user_id":3689364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1wGCo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"EliteRaceElephant","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3689364/eliteraceelephant"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569773958,"post_id":58156900,"comment_id":102696652,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156900/integrating-to-not-from-xero#comment102696652_58156900"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12139142,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10217711632396714/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kirstin Duffield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139142/kirstin-duffield"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569772854,"creation_date":1569772854,"question_id":58156900,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156900","body_markdown":"We produce a monthly set of numbers:\r\n\r\nDebtors, Creditors, taxes(and fees, and Exchange gains/losses.\r\n\r\nPer period, per month, per division\r\n\r\nWe want to send these amounts to their corresponding Nominal (xero) account codes (which will have been set up already to match.)\r\n\r\nPlease point me in the right direction of the suitable code.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156900/integrating-to-not-from-xero","title":"Integrating to (not from) xero"},{"tags":["javascript","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":10779780,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7OxXl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kashir hasnain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10779780/kashir-hasnain"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569773702,"post_id":58156897,"comment_id":102696585,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58156897/background-image-not-displaying-on-personal-website#comment102696585_58156897"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12139113,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAN3VSwkSnZ-q5ODh8UhMqFWJHm7rYaKiTSBaYdCg=k-s128","display_name":"dj_ej","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12139113/dj-ej"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9000,"user_id":1839439,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qWQe4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dharman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1839439/dharman"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569786315,"creation_date":1569772848,"last_edit_date":1569786315,"question_id":58156897,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58156897","body_markdown":"I am trying to display a background image on a few pages of my personal website that I am building.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to make sure that my CSS stylesheet is loaded correctly by checking my website&#39;s network (and I believe it is), I&#39;ve tried to make sure that the file path to the image is correct by putting the image folder in all possible places and tried to put the full file path in the url() function, and I&#39;ve tried to create different elements on my page to see if it was just an issue of my image not being displayed in a valid element.
