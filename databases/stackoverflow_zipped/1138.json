am very new to this and this may be the simplest thing to do so sorry in advance but looking at all the code in all of these forums just sends my head spinning.\r\n\r\nI am trying to create a workflow for my service business using Google Sheets, I believe I have created all of the steps except this one, I need to assign a button on my google sheet that once its pressed it sends the values in 3 different cells across into another sheet and creates a row, this row remains, the original google sheet can now be cleared and when it is filled in again and the button is pressed again, the 3 cell values get sent across as before but into the next row down.\r\n\r\nThe actual use for this is as follows, The Google Sheet I have created is what we call a service record card, it holds customer details and a list of assets that are on their site, I have created dropdowns listing my products and services and have used functions like COUNTIFS to create a dynamic sheet that calculates the costs, this then fills out a hidden sheet with all these costs and then with the function that I am asking about i want to be able to click a button and send &quot;Service Date&quot;, &quot;Site Location&quot; &amp; &quot;Total Cost&quot; cell values over to a final hidden sheet which will act as a Service History record, from there I have set up functions whereby each time a new row gets added to the service history, it then gets added to a master invoice list, this then feeds into my accounting software.\r\n\r\nI now I could probably set the cell values to just update as they are filled in in the first sheet, but I want the control of being able to fill everything in, then deciding when to click the button, send the information over then have it stored, so I can wipe the template ready for the next time we come to service that customer.\r\n\r\nI hope all that makes sense, I have got any code to show anyone, I am pretty sure this is quite a simple thing.

How?\r\n   # Now rely on flask to send the third response\r\n   return &#39;200 OK...&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI cannot dispatch on a path.\r\n\r\nThanks for any input!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271715/how-to-send-multiple-responses-from-one-request-in-flask","title":"How to send multiple responses from one request in Flask?"},{"tags":["python","function","nested-loops","shapes"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-49EuUNtVVN4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc87Pns0OHnnaEFauPdNREv4iUqdw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Noam ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177224/noam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570461644,"post_id":58271714,"comment_id":102911802,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271714/need-to-make-a-honeycomb-using-a-def-and-a-nested-while-loop#comment102911802_58271714"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177224,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-49EuUNtVVN4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc87Pns0OHnnaEFauPdNREv4iUqdw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Noam ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177224/noam"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570458728,"creation_date":1570458728,"question_id":58271714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271714","body_markdown":"So I managed to make 3 honeycombs positioned the way I want, but I want to make another 3 honeycombs positioned upside down to make it connected properly. \r\n\r\nMy end goal is to have a honey comb with 5 hexagons at the bottom, with the middle one being black, \r\na second layer with 6 hexagons in which hexagons number-2, 5 are black while the others are yellow.

Was my expectation wrong?\r\n\r\nEDIT 3:\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using PHP version 7.3.6, official Windows build.\r\n\r\nEDIT 4:\r\n\r\nFYI: The code posted is the version that does NOT work.\r\n\r\nThe code that does seem to work is:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php declare(strict_types=1);\r\n    \r\n    namespace ns;\r\n    \r\n    global $a;\r\n    $a = &#39;Test&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    function f() {\r\n      global $a;\r\n      echo $a;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI think people misunderstood when I said before initialization. I meant exactly what I said.\r\n\r\nEDIT 5:\r\n\r\nFWIW: I think the issue is because the composer autoloader is including the file in a function context. I wasn&#39;t testing this on the console and I expect others trying to reproduce the problem did. I think the autoloader is adding a scope to the variables that are supposed to be global. That&#39;s why adding the global statement works. I didn&#39;t think to mention the autoloader before because this simplified test case seemed self contained, and I didn&#39;t expect the autoloader had side effects. I still argue that this isn&#39;t a duplicate question. This scenario wasn&#39;t mentioned in the other answers.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271711/defining-variable-inside-namespace-and-retrieving-within-same-namespace-or-from","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Defining variable inside namespace and retrieving within same namespace or from global scope"},{"tags":["http","https","web-config","iis-10"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45122,"user_id":11182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/842cd81474e74828f6afc3760766c7a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lex Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11182/lex-li"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570476979,"post_id":58271703,"comment_id":102918736,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271703/redirect-from-http-to-https-not-working-403-forbidden-message-in-client#comment102918736_58271703"},{"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570696159,"post_id":58271703,"comment_id":102996725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271703/redirect-from-http-to-https-not-working-403-forbidden-message-in-client#comment102996725_58271703"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12177128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4a7b05cb1627607b36d46cef541105?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erwin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177128/erwin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570605500,"post_id":58282028,"comment_id":102960576,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271703/redirect-from-http-to-https-not-working-403-forbidden-message-in-client/58282028#comment102960576_58282028"},{"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12177128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4a7b05cb1627607b36d46cef541105?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erwin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177128/erwin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570605669,"post_id":58282028,"comment_id":102960643,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271703/redirect-from-http-to-https-not-working-403-forbidden-message-in-client/58282028#comment102960643_58282028"},{"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12177128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab4a7b05cb1627607b36d46cef541105?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erwin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177128/erwin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570670541,"post_id":58282028,"comment_id":102989005,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271703/redirect-from-http-to-https-not-working-403-forbidden-message-in-client/58282028#comment102989005_58282028"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1382,"user_id":11147346,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u9Id5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jalpa Panchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11147346/jalpa-panchal"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570520398,"creation_date":1570520398,"answer_id":58282028,"question_id":58271703,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58282028","body_markdown":"Use below URL rewrite rule:\r\n\r\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\r\n     &lt;system.webServer&gt;\r\n     &lt;rewrite&gt;\r\n     &lt;rules&gt;\r\n     &lt;rule name=&quot;HTTPS force&quot;

However your target variable &#39;type&#39; is a of type Object and not an &#39;Array of Objects&#39;. In simpler terms, Map cannot store an \r\nArray.\r\n\r\nLets take a simpler approach to this problem(not a recommended approach). If we convert the map manually to an array of maps, that would look like this:\r\n\r\n`yourJson -&gt; [Map1(en,category1(Ap,ap2)),Map2(en,category2(Ap,ap2))]`\r\n\r\ni.e. An array of Maps\r\n\r\nSo in java equivalent this becomes:\r\n```\r\nType typeOfT2 = new TypeToken&lt;ArrayList&lt;HashMap&lt;String, Category&gt;&gt;&gt;() {}.getType();\r\nList&lt;HashMap&lt;String, Category&gt;&gt; list = gson.fromJson(text, typeOfT2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get to what we want, but there are better ways of doing this. We need Jackson instead of Gson for this.(Some one may add a Gson based solution, pretty sure a cleaner one than above exists). Here we will use `ObjectMapper` from `com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper`\r\n```\r\nObjectMapper om = new ObjectMapper();\r\nList&lt;Map.Entry&lt;String, Category&gt;&gt; listx = om.readValue(text, ArrayList.class);\r\n```\r\nIf you print `listx`. You can see this(overridden `toString()` of Category class):\r\n\r\n`[{en={key1=Ap, key2=ap2}}, {ar={key1=Ap, key2=ap2}}]`\r\n\r\n`listx` is the most accurate representation of your json and not a Map.\r\n\r\nNow if you need a map, I will leave that as an exercise for you about how to convert your List of Map.Entry to a Map implementation.\r\n\r\nPS.: First long answer here.

Its fairly complicated and I wouldn&#39;t be able to explain what it does well but you can look it up and should find some decent articles. When you send that json data is is serialized and even if you didn&#39;t include it in the json file java will have the not included fields as null. When you save the entity hibernate will delete children or set fields as null (because in java they are null). To accomplish your goal I would use the @DynamicUpdate annotation on your entity. Then you could create a DTO that represents your partial json data. Then in your service fetch the entity by id and set its relevant fields from the DTO. Lazy loading will ensure that children aren&#39;t pulled from the database and the @DynamicUpdate will ensure that only the updated fields are included in the update SQL statement coming from hibernate. This should be fairly efficient. I would also suggest setting the hibernate.show_sql flag in your properties to true so you can see what hibernate is doing under the hood. Hibernate can do some funky stuff or even ignore your annotations sometimes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271680/why-cascadetype-merge-delete-records-in-database/58296839#58296839","title":"Why CascadeType.MERGE delete records in database"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12176831,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73e9a030d86f45e1edc9dfc08fb11fd4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pascal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12176831/pascal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570593304,"creation_date":1570458613,"question_id":58271680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271680","body_markdown":"I am developping a web application of REST type with Angular (Typescript) for the frontend, and Spring (boot, rest, data, hibernate) for the backend which is connected to a MySQL database.\r\nIn this application, a User java Object has attributes and is linked to severals lists of objects (publications, intendedUsages, roles, userGroups and managedGroups), using JPA annotation like you can see below.\r\n\r\nIn the User.java\r\n\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)\r\n    @Column(name = &quot;userId&quot;)\r\n    private Long userId;\r\n    private String firstName;\r\n    private String lastName;\r\n    private String email;\r\n    private String photo;\r\n    private String instantMessaging;\r\n    @Column(length = 50)\r\n    private String phoneNumber;\r\n    private String personnalURL;\r\n    private Timestamp charterAcceptanceDate;\r\n    \r\n    @Column(unique=true)\r\n    private String username;\r\n    private Timestamp expirationDate;\r\n    private String password;\r\n    private Timestamp creationDate;\r\n    private Timestamp approvedDate;\r\n    private boolean isActive;\r\n    private boolean isAdmin;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    // Relations\r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;user&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, orphanRemoval = true)\r\n    private List&lt;Publication&gt; publications = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        \r\n    @OneToMany(mappedBy = &quot;user&quot;, cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, orphanRemoval = true)\r\n    private List&lt;IntendedUsage&gt; intendedUsages = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        \r\n    @ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.MERGE, fetch=FetchType.EAGER)\r\n    private List&lt;Role&gt; roles = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    // List of groups the user belongs to.\r\n    @ManyToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.MERGE}, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinTable(\r\n    name = &quot;user_group&quot;, \r\n    joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;user_id&quot;) }, \r\n    inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;group_id&quot;) }\r\n    )\r\n    private List&lt;Group&gt; userGroups = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    // List of groups managed by the user.\r\n    @ManyToMany(cascade = {CascadeType.MERGE}, fetch = FetchType.LAZY)\r\n    @JoinTable(\r\n        name = &quot;managed_group&quot;, \r\n        joinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;user_id&quot;) }, \r\n        inverseJoinColumns = { @JoinColumn(name = &quot;group_id&quot;) }\r\n    )\r\n    private List&lt;Group&gt; managedGroups = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    In Role.java\r\n    \r\n    @JsonSerialize(using = UserListCustomSerializer.class)\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;roles&quot;)\r\n    private List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    In Group.java\r\n    \r\n    // List of users included in the group.\r\n    @JsonSerialize(using = UserListForGroupCustomSerializer.class)\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;userGroups&quot;)\r\n    private List&lt;User&gt; users = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n    \t\r\n    // List of users who are managing the group.\r\n    @JsonSerialize(using = ManagerListForGroupCustomSerializer.class)\r\n    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = &quot;managedGroups&quot;)\r\n    private List&lt;User&gt; managerUsers = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the frontend, I have a form to modify User characteristics.

Similarly basenames (before the extension) _should_ describe what is in the file, but do not always do so correctly. What matters is what is in the files.\r\n\r\n`.key` is usually used for a lone privatekey, but look at it to make sure, and also to determine what format it is in because there are many. You should _never_ get your privatekey from a CA; it should be generated locally, usually on the machine where it will be used and at least by the &#39;owner&#39; or admin of that machine. There might be a sort-of exception if you are talking about a CA internal to a company, organization, agency, or office -- in that case the person running the CA may be the same person who is responsible for security on all the machines -- or vice versa, depending on your perspective -- and it may make sense for them to generate both the key and the cert. \r\n\r\n`.pem` is used for _lots_ of things in [PEM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy-Enhanced_Mail), and what the contents of that file is (or are) matters more than the fact of it being PEM. Look at the first line `-----BEGIN (somewords)-----` and see what the word(s) is(are). That should be followed either immediately or after a few header lines by data in base64 (a solid block of letters, digits, and the special characters + / =), then a matching `-----END (somewords)-----` line. If the END line is followed by a another similar block, or several, look at all of them. \r\n\r\n`.cer` is commonly used for certificates in either &#39;DER&#39; (binary) or &#39;PEM&#39; (as above) format. `.p7b` is similarly used for &#39;dummy&#39; PKCS7 messages containing certificates -- especially certificates used in a chain -- in either DER or PEM. More significantly, p7b is sometimes used for the whole chain _including_ the end-entity (server) cert, and sometimes the rest of the chain _excluding_ the EE cert, and it matters which. If you have OpenSSL -- or can get it (e.g. by installing a package, or for Windows I recommend the installer from http://www.slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html ) or can move your data to a machine that has it -- then do:\r\n\r\n     # if the p7b file is in PEM format (you can see ----BEGIN PKCS7----- line)\r\n     openssl pkcs7 -in file.p7b -print_certs \r\n     # if the p7b file is in DER format (looks like garbage in a text editor or display)\r\n     openssl pkcs7 -in file.p7b -inform der -print_certs\r\n     # for now look only at the subject= and issuer= lines to see\r\n     # for each cert in the file who it is for, and if/how they chain\r\n\r\nThen:\r\n\r\n* if the `.key` file is a privatekey in one of the PEM formats supported by OpenSSL you can use that; else if `.key` is a privatekey in some other format, or `.pem` is or includes a privatekey in some format, you&#39;ll need to convert and/or extract it: tell us more about what those files look like.\r\n\r\n* if the `.p7b` file is in PEM or DER format, put its expanded output (from above) in a file. If this includes the EE cert skip the next step.\r\n\r\n* if the `.p7b` file does not include the EE cert, but the `.cer` file is that cert, if in PEM format just append it to the file containing the `.p7b` output; if in DER format convert it with `openssl x509 -in file.cer -inform der` and append _that_.\r\n\r\n* if you now have the privatekey in one of the PEM formats supported by OpenSSL, and the cert chain including the EE cert in PEM format, do\r\n```\r\n    openssl pkcs12 -export -in chain.pem -inkey key.pem -out newfile.p12 [-name x]\r\n    # the -name option provides the &#39;alias&#39; used by Java\r\n    # if not specified it defaults to the numeral 1 (one)\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271672/how-to-generate-keystore-p12-from-certificate-cer-certificate-chain-p7b-an/58285496#58285496","title":"How to Generate keystore.p12 from Certificate(.cer) , certificate chain(.p7b) and from key(.key and .pem)"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":3169715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc7047c8f23659c191f70ee8c7df6f83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3169715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3169715/user3169715"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":3169715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc7047c8f23659c191f70ee8c7df6f83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3169715","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3169715/user3169715"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570609788,"creation_date":1570458574,"last_edit_date":1570609788,"question_id":58271672,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271672","body_markdown":"I have the following files: \r\n\r\n - filename.key (RSA PRIVATE KEY)\r\n - filename.pem (CERTIFICATE REQUEST)\r\n - certificate.cer (CERTIFICATE)\r\n - CertificateChain.p7b\r\n\r\nI have received these files from the CA including the certificate chain.\r\nI need to generate &#39;keystore.p12&#39; to configure SSL for spring boot application with the following information.\r\n```\r\n server:\r\n    port: 443\r\n    ssl:\r\n        key-store: keystore.p12\r\n        key-store-password: &lt;your-password&gt;\r\n        keyStoreType: PKCS12\r\n        keyAlias: &lt;my alias&gt;\r\n```\r\nCan anyone please help me to generate the &#39;keystore.p12&#39;?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271672/how-to-generate-keystore-p12-from-certificate-cer-certificate-chain-p7b-an","title":"How to Generate keystore.p12 from Certificate(.cer) , certificate chain(.p7b) and from key(.key and .pem)"},{"tags":["sql-server","reporting-services"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2035,"user_id":3115822,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100003045253026/picture?type=large","display_name":"borchvm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3115822/borchvm"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570459048,"post_id":58271669,"comment_id":102910474,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271669/i-have-tablix-and-two-subreport-tablix-has-all-employee-header-information-s#comment102910474_58271669"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177203,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9463bee91e375ba9821675517e66244e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ruban","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177203/ruban"},"last_editor":{"reputation":31353,"user_id":3706016,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wqmW0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jarlh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3706016/jarlh"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570475662,"creation_date":1570458566,"last_edit_date":1570475662,"question_id":58271669,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271669","body_markdown":"1.

best way to deal with the month match is to use vectorization in pandas and do this:\r\n\r\n    new_column = (df.date1.dt.month == df.date2.dt.month).astype(int)\r\n\r\nThat is, avoid using `apply()` over the `DataFrame` (which will probably be iterative) and take advantage of the underlying `numpy` vectorization. The gateway to such functionality is almost always in families of `Series` functions and properties, like the `dt` family for dates, `str` family for strings, and so forth.\r\n\r\nLuckily, you have pre-computed the id_list membership in your `bool_column`, so to add membership as a criterion, just do this:\r\n\r\n    new_column = ((df.date1.dt.month == df.date2.dt.month) &amp; df.bool_column).astype(int)\r\n\r\nOnce again, the `&amp;` of two `Series` takes advantage of vectorization. You stay inside boolean space till the end, then cast to `int` with `astype(int)`. Reviewing your code, it occurs to me that the iterative checking of your id_list may be the real performance hit here, even more so than the `DataFrame.apply()`. Whatever you do, avoid at all costs iterating your id_list at each row, since you already have a vector denoting membership in your `bool_column`.\r\n\r\nBy the way I believe there&#39;s a tiny error in your example data, the `new_column` value for your third row should be `0`, since your `bool_column` value there is `0`.

can conditionally prevent a click event from firing on your slider by registering a `click` event listener that shares the `moved` variable with your `mousedown` and `mousemove` event listeners.\r\n\r\nThe [`{ passive: true }`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener#Parameters) option indicates that the listener does not call `event.preventDefault()`, and saves a lot CPU time particularly for the `mousemove` event which can fire several times per second.\r\n\r\nThe `true` parameter indicates that the event listener should

They use a fixed SQL string with placeholders and the library makes sure that nothing bad can happen, no matter what the user-supplied values may be.\r\n\r\nThis also means we can prepare an SQL statement up-front and re-use it many times throughout the lifetime of the page.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-vb --&gt;\r\n\r\n    Dim Conn &#39; As ADODB.Connection\r\n    Dim Cmd  &#39; As ADODB.Command\r\n    \r\n    Set Conn = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)\r\n    Set Cmd = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Command&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    Conn.Open &quot;Provider=Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source=D:\\path\\to\\your\\database.accdb;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    &#39; prepare a reusable command with parameters (i.e. placeholders)\r\n    With Cmd\r\n      Set .ActiveConnection = Conn\r\n      .CommandType = adCmdText\r\n      .CommandText = &quot;SELECT Field1, Field2, Field3 WHERE brand = @brand AND application = @season&quot;\r\n\r\n      &#39; set up the parameters for each placeholder\r\n      &#39;  - use proper datatypes here, as per your DB\r\n      &#39;  - varchar types need a defined length\r\n      .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter(&quot;@brand&quot;, adVarChar, , 50)\r\n      .Parameters.Append .CreateParameter(&quot;@season&quot;, adVarChar, , 100)\r\n    End With\r\n    \r\n    &#39; helper function that operates the Command object and returns a RecordSet\r\n    Function SearchTyres(brand, season)\r\n      Cmd.Parameters(&quot;@brand&quot;, brand)\r\n      Cmd.Parameters(&quot;@season&quot;, season)\r\n      Set SearchTyres = Cmd.Execute\r\n    End With\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s convenient to be able to use the ADODB-specific constants such as `adCmdText` or `adVarChar` in your code. To have them available anywhere without fuss, you need to declare the ADODB type library in your `global.asa` file (create one if you don&#39;t have it), adding this to the top of the file:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!--metadata \r\n    \ttype=&quot;TypeLib&quot; \r\n    \tname=&quot;Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 6.1 Library&quot; \r\n    \tuuid=&quot;B691E011-1797-432E-907A-4D8C69339129&quot;\r\n    \tversion=&quot;6.1&quot;\r\n    --&gt;\r\n\r\nNow you can use this in your page, for example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-vb --&gt;\r\n\r\n    If Len(brand1) &gt; 2 Then\r\n      With SearchTyres(brand1, season1)\r\n        &#39; ...let&#39;s do something with the RecordSet\r\n        While Not .EOF\r\n          Response.Write Server.HTMLEncode(!Field1) &amp; &quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;\r\n          .MoveNext\r\n        Wend\r\n      End With\r\n    End If\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\n - Don&#39;t do `SELECT *` - always write out the fields you want to have.\r\n - Declaring the type library is not strictly necessary, but if you don&#39;t, then you have to define all the constants like `adVarChar` yourself, and that&#39;s much more hassle than it&#39;s worth.\r\n - `With SearchTyres(...)` is convenience shorthand for  \r\n    \r\n        Dim Rs\r\n        Set Rs = SearchTyres(...)\r\n        With Rs\r\n          &#39; ...\r\n        End With\r\n\r\n - `Rs!Field1` is convenience shorthand for `Rs.Fields(&quot;Field1&quot;)`. Inside a `With Rs` block, the `Rs` itself is optional, so a plain `!Field1` is actually meaningful.\r\n - Lastly, it can help to create code in the VBA IDE of an MS Office product (such as Word). Use Tools/References to reference the same ADODB type library. VBA and VBS are not 100 code-compatible, but the VBA IDE has Intellisense, a proper debugger, uses the same objects and code can be transferred to ASP with minimal changes.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://xkcd.com/327/\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/command-object-ado\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ado/reference/ado-api/parameters-collection-ado\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271628/how-to-filter-data-parsed-from-database-using-asp/58272983#58272983","title":"How to filter data parsed from database using ASP"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12474,"user_id":692942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c23d23a6c35f8e8a0af302e6e86a9643?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lankymart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/692942/lankymart"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570704901,"post_id":58310981,"comment_id":103001418,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271628/how-to-filter-data-parsed-from-database-using-asp/58310981#comment103001418_58310981"},{"owner":{"reputation":270668,"user_id":18771,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ada184c98bf9073d15b2dc815be0170?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tomalak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/18771/tomalak"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570705413,"post_id":58310981,"comment_id":103001667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271628/how-to-filter-data-parsed-from-database-using-asp/58310981#comment103001667_58310981"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":427,"user_id":611695,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48112477242da590cacbe1cde47e1655?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Soren","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/611695/soren"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1570649167,"creation_date":1570649167,"answer_id":58310981,"question_id":58271628,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58310981","body_markdown":"Since everyone else is busy bashing you instead of actually answering your question of how to build your sql string:\r\n\r\n    &lt;%\r\n   \r\n        SqlStr = &quot;SELECT * FROM Tyres WHERE 1 = 1 &quot;

For the very last step to complete my work, I have a problem with passing &quot;multiple&quot; cv::Mat from dll to C#.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found some examples on the Internet about C# using OpenCvSharp to receive a cv::Mat from dll, and **it worked well like this in my code** (it&#39;s simplified):\r\n\r\n``` C++\r\n//original.hpp\r\nextern &quot;C&quot;

Then I submit the form and the data from both fields are submitted along with the form and mapped with fields on the other end (in this case a CRM, creating those fields is not a problem).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271591/how-to-fill-a-form-field-with-data-from-google-analytics-with-javascipt","title":"How to fill a Form Field with data from Google Analytics with Javascipt?"},{"tags":["sql","ms-access"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570458454,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102910144,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102910144_58271587"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2868386556523610/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kalsoom Ashraf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177196/kalsoom-ashraf"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570458670,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102910278,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102910278_58271587"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2868386556523610/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kalsoom Ashraf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177196/kalsoom-ashraf"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570460110,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102911028,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102911028_58271587"},{"owner":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570460215,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102911083,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102911083_58271587"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2868386556523610/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kalsoom Ashraf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177196/kalsoom-ashraf"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570460322,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102911148,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102911148_58271587"},{"owner":{"reputation":47128,"user_id":980550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8emhY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lurker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/980550/lurker"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570460471,"post_id":58271587,"comment_id":102911232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271587/i-get-a-syntax-error-in-from-clause-from-my-query#comment102911232_58271587"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12177196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2868386556523610/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kalsoom Ashraf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12177196/kalsoom-ashraf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":32752,"user_id":3219613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b01a7cc73ab19f844bdbcd951876ecb5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pᴇʜ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3219613/p%e1%b4%87%ca%9c"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570460041,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1570516391,"creation_date":1570458286,"last_edit_date":1570516391,"question_id":58271587,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271587","body_markdown":"```sql\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM Table1\r\nINTERSECT\r\nSELECT *\r\nFROM Table2;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is showing an error:\r\n\r\n&gt;

You can setup a load balancer, or configure an existing one to forward a port to the nodeport of all the worker nodes in your k8s cluster. Then you can call the backend through that load balancer.\r\n\r\n2) Use an ingress. The ingress probably already has a load balancer in front of it, and this might be easier to implement. With an ingress, you don&#39;t need a NodePort. You can directly connect the pods from the ingress, or add a service in front of each and connect to that service.\r\n\r\nYou have multiple pods in the backend, and they seem to be peer nodes in the blockchain, not replicas of the same pod. If you need to create three separate endpoints so you can control which peer you connect, an ingress with three proxies connected to these pods would work. \r\n\r\nIf you do not care which peer you connect, then you can add a service in front of the three pods as a load balancer. You can add a common label to all three peers, and have your service select its destination using that label, so when you hit the service, it acts as a load balancer between the peers. Then you can expose that service via the ingress.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271584/connecting-remotly-a-blockchain-made-with-hyperledger-fabric-1-4-running-with-ku/58272581#58272581","title":"Connecting remotly a blockchain made with Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 running with Kubernetes"}],"owner":{"reputation":5883,"user_id":1956558,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8D66D.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Juliatzin del Toro","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1956558/juliatzin-del-toro"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58272581,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570461778,"creation_date":1570458279,"question_id":58271584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271584","body_markdown":"I have a Hyperledger Fabric 1.4 blockchain running under Kubernetes\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    ➜  ~ kubectl get svc -n blockchain\r\n    NAME                      TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP                                                               PORT(S)                           AGE\r\n    blockchain-orderer        NodePort       100.68.98.142    &lt;none&gt;                                                                    31010:31010/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-orderer2       NodePort       100.64.169.137   &lt;none&gt;                                                                    32010:32010/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-orderer3       NodePort       100.68.185.88    &lt;none&gt;                                                                    31012:31012/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org1-ca        NodePort       100.66.249.91    &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30054:30054/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org1peer1      NodePort       100.70.28.4      &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30110:30110/TCP,30111:30111/TCP   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org2-ca        NodePort       100.68.243.9     &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30055:30055/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org2peer1      NodePort       100.71.114.216   &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30210:30210/TCP,30211:30211/TCP   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org3-ca        NodePort       100.64.199.106   &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30056:30056/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org3peer1      NodePort       100.66.55.254    &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30310:30310/TCP,30311:30311/TCP   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org4-ca        NodePort       100.70.219.197   &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30057:30057/TCP                   7d4h\r\n    blockchain-org4peer1      NodePort       100.69.141.45    &lt;none&gt;                                                                    30410:30410/TCP,30411:30411/TCP   7d4h\r\n    docker                    ClusterIP      100.67.69.23     &lt;none&gt;                                                                    2375/TCP                          7d4h\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I want is to connect Blockchain remotly from a Go app, and send data to write.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I don&#39;t know how to test connectivity, from what I understand, with a NodePort service, I would be able to connect blockchain statically, via ip:port, as states the [docs][1]\r\n\r\n&gt; Exposes the Service on each Node’s IP at a static port (the NodePort).

my project use FriendlyUrls and I figured out that with FriendlyUrls the things does not working and always return the url without the extension &quot;.aspx&quot; but with the querystring not encrypted\r\n\r\n```\r\nImports System.Web.Routing\r\nImports Microsoft.AspNet.FriendlyUrls\r\n\r\nPublic Module RouteConfig\r\n    Sub RegisterRoutes(ByVal routes As RouteCollection)\r\n        Dim settings As FriendlyUrlSettings = New FriendlyUrlSettings() With {\r\n            .AutoRedirectMode = RedirectMode.Permanent\r\n        }\r\n        routes.EnableFriendlyUrls(settings)\r\n    End Sub\r\nEnd Module\r\n```\r\n\r\nof course if I set `.AutoRedirectMode` to `Off` it works but without friendlyurls.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nEDIT 09/10/2019:\r\n\r\nWe figured out that remove the test of OriginalString.Contains(&quot;aspx&quot;) in the `context_BeginRequest` the encryption works, now the code is like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrivate Sub context_BeginRequest(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As EventArgs)\r\n        Dim context As HttpContext = HttpContext.Current\r\n\r\n        If context.Request.RawUrl.Contains(&quot;?&quot;) Then\r\n            Dim query As String = ExtractQuery(context.Request.RawUrl)\r\n            Dim path As String = GetVirtualPath()\r\n\r\n            If query.StartsWith(PARAMETER_NAME, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) Then\r\n                Dim rawQuery As String = query.Replace(PARAMETER_NAME, String.Empty)\r\n                Dim decryptedQuery As String = Decrypt(rawQuery)\r\n                context.RewritePath(path, String.Empty, decryptedQuery)\r\n            ElseIf context.Request.HttpMethod = &quot;GET&quot; Then\r\n                Dim encryptedQuery As String = Encrypt(query)\r\n                context.Response.Redirect(path &amp; encryptedQuery)\r\n            End If\r\n        End If\r\n    End Sub\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now the question is: there is other method to target an aspx page without test the extension? I think there is a risk that targeting things that not should target like &quot;ashx&quot; or cache-busting code that use querystring.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://madskristensen.net/blog/httpmodule-for-query-string-encryption/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271580/querystringmodule-with-friendlyurls-does-not-working","title":"QueryStringModule with FriendlyUrls does not working"},{"tags":["circuit-sdk"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":474,"user_id":1658655,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sSAL0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roger Urscheler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1658655/roger-urscheler"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570458926,"creation_date":1570458926,"answer_id":58271770,"question_id":58271576,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58271770","body_markdown":"The domain will be the system your tenant is located at.

src=&quot;{{absolute_url(vich_uploader_asset(parametresAdmin, &#39;logoFile&#39;))}}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nBut when I start the action, there is a **loop** and I end up having the following **error**:\r\n\r\n&gt; Error: Maximum execution time of 120 seconds exceeded\r\n\r\nHowever, if I cancel adding the image, the PDF loads well (but without the image since I do not display it)\r\n\r\nI checked on the url of the image was well an absolute way and that it was correct, doing this in my Twig:\r\n\r\n    {% set var = absolute_url(vich_uploader_asset(parametresAdmin, &#39;logoFile&#39;)) %}\r\n                &lt;pre&gt;\r\n                {{ dump(var) }}\r\n\r\nAnd it is ! \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd **the path is good**, because I can open the file in a new tab.\r\n\r\nI tried to display my image with a split in my **twig** :\r\n\r\n    {% set var = absolute_url(vich_uploader_asset(parametresAdmin, &#39;logoFile&#39;)) %}\r\n    &lt;img style=&quot;width:90px;&quot;

If i use UIView with some color instead of ImageView then it works correctly.\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271570/ios-changing-navigation-bar-zposition-and-uiimageview","title":"iOS &gt; Changing Navigation Bar zPosition and UIImageView"},{"tags":["database","spring-boot","liquibase","changeset","changelog"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":5878215,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87d14d1c1f1b2ac977cbf915704caf80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Zorglube","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5878215/zorglube"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570458603,"post_id":58271569,"comment_id":102910228,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271569/liquibase-include-external-changelogfile#comment102910228_58271569"},{"owner":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570458846,"post_id":58271569,"comment_id":102910370,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271569/liquibase-include-external-changelogfile#comment102910370_58271569"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":6139676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/848415555304982/picture?type=large","display_name":"Monoem Youneb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6139676/monoem-youneb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570459044,"post_id":58271569,"comment_id":102910472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271569/liquibase-include-external-changelogfile#comment102910472_58271569"},{"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":6139676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/848415555304982/picture?type=large","display_name":"Monoem Youneb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6139676/monoem-youneb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570459262,"post_id":58271569,"comment_id":102910583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271569/liquibase-include-external-changelogfile#comment102910583_58271569"}],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":6139676,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/848415555304982/picture?type=large","display_name":"Monoem Youneb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6139676/monoem-youneb"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570458226,"creation_date":1570458226,"question_id":58271569,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271569","body_markdown":"I want to include external changelogFile in liquibase using springboot,\r\nmy file **db.changelog-master.xml** call external changeset in E: partition\r\n\r\n    &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n    &lt;databaseChangeLog\r\n        \txmlns=&quot;http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog&quot;\r\n        \txmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;\r\n        \txsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog\r\n                      \thttp://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.3.xsd&quot;&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;include file=&quot;E:/00-PBI/PBI_105364/test-jar/db/changelog/V0_changelog_CREER_EMPLOYEE_DEPARTEMENT.xml&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/databaseChangeLog&gt;\r\n\r\nThen I got this message:\r\n\r\n    Caused by: liquibase.exception.ChangeLogParseException: liquibase.exception.SetupException: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: name\r\n\r\nis there anyone who can tell me whay i can&#39;t include this changeset?

Yes, but that calculated value is never assigned or returned, so either use a variable to get the result of the calculation:\r\n\r\n    def findhypot(a , b):\r\n        result = ((a*a)+(b*b)%2)\r\n        return result\r\n\r\nOr return the calculation directly:\r\n\r\n    def findhypot(a , b):\r\n        return ((a*a)+(b*b)%2)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut now you will get 9 as result for 3 and 4. 5 should be the correct value.

would like to insert a request for an OTP (One Time Password) password into the login process for a Windows server.  \r\n\r\nI know there are third-party services that do this but would like to consider doing it myself.  We have on our network an API server that will do the validation of an OTP code.\r\n\r\nMy question is whether what I am trying to do is actually feasible.\r\n\r\nAs I see it the process would go something like:\r\n\r\n1. Set up a script to run whenever any user logs in. I see this is a standard option in Windows.\r\n\r\n2. The script would then request from the user the OTP code and send an api call to get it validated and receive back the response.\r\n\r\n3. If valid then the script ends, letting the user continue with the login.\r\n\r\n4. If invalid, it displays a message and logs out the user.\r\n\r\nIn principle can the above be done?\r\n\r\nWould it be safe? Could the script be secured against being interrupted by the user (even if Admin) which would then cancel the whole process, leaving the user logged in?\r\n\r\nAt step 2 the script must wait for user input.  If at that point the user, who has technically logged in, can cancel the script then obviously the whole process is worthless.\r\n\r\nAdvice whether it is worth proceeding with this would be welcome.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271541/windows-logon-script-to-ask-for-an-otp-password","title":"Windows logon script to ask for an OTP password"},{"tags":["azure","elasticsearch","web-crawler","nutch"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6329,"user_id":2123530,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37a7fba006184897e8d74f1795e2835b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"β.εηοιτ.βε","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2123530/%ce%b2-%ce%b5%ce%b7%ce%bf%ce%b9%cf%84-%ce%b2%ce%b5"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570479432,"post_id":58271539,"comment_id":102919620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271539/deploying-local-elasticsearch-cluster-on-azure#comment102919620_58271539"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":317,"user_id":2520199,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/531fe96270eb476116a7c2f88d082675?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"vermaji","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2520199/vermaji"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570473840,"creation_date":1570473840,"answer_id":58275414,"question_id":58271539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58275414","body_markdown":"You can not deploy local cluster on azure, you need to setup another es cluster on azure nodes &amp; point your writing application to that cluster.

The second at the end of the code is to ensure that no unbalanced opening brackets are left on the stack when the end of the string is reached.\r\n\r\nBtw, a shorter version of your code (which also works for strings containing `char`s other than only brackets) is\r\n\r\n    bool areParanthesisBalanced(std::string const&amp;expr) \r\n    { \r\n        std::stack&lt;char&gt; s;\r\n        for(auto x : expr)\r\n            switch(x) {\r\n            case &#39;[&#39;:\r\n            case &#39;(&#39;:\r\n            case &#39;{&#39;:\r\n                s.push(x);\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;]&#39;:\r\n                if(s.empty() || s.top() != &#39;[&#39;)\r\n                    return false;\r\n                s.pop()\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;)&#39;:\r\n                if(s.empty() || s.top() != &#39;(&#39;)\r\n                    return false;\r\n                s.pop()\r\n                break;\r\n            case &#39;}&#39;:\r\n                if(s.empty() || s.top() != &#39;{&#39;)\r\n                    return false;\r\n                s.pop()\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n        return s.empty();\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58271496/balanced-parenthesis-problem-why-check-if-its-empty/58271880#58271880","title":"Balanced parenthesis problem why check if its empty?"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10798572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a221e214d1ab31f18d6734847113a591?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10798572","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10798572/user10798572"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10798572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a221e214d1ab31f18d6734847113a591?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10798572","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10798572/user10798572"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58271880,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570475462,"creation_date":1570457997,"last_edit_date":1570459137,"question_id":58271496,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58271496","body_markdown":"I am confused about why do we need to check if the stack is empty?\r\nBecause then what if for example, the string doesn&#39;t have any type or parenthesis, then we will always have false which will mean string is unbalanced?\r\nCant, we even neglect the `if(s.empty())` and just return false immediately since there wont be anything pushed inside the stack?\r\n    \r\n        \r\n    #include&lt;bits/stdc++.h&gt; \r\n    using namespace std; \r\n    \r\n    // function to check if paranthesis are balanced \r\n    bool areParanthesisBalanced(string expr) \r\n    { \r\n    \tstack&lt;char&gt; s; \r\n    \tchar x; \r\n    \r\n    \t// Traversing the Expression \r\n    \tfor (int i=0; i&lt;expr.length(); i++) \r\n    \t{ \r\n    \t\tif (expr[i]==&#39;(&#39;||expr[i]==&#39;[&#39;||expr[i]==&#39;{&#39;) \r\n    \t\t{ \r\n    \t\t\t// Push the element in the stack \r\n    \t\t\ts.push(expr[i]); \r\n    \t\t\tcontinue; \r\n    \t\t} \r\n        /*if (expr[i]==&#39;}&#39;||expr[i]==&#39;}&#39;||expr[i]==&#39;}&#39;) \r\n    return false; \r\n    \r\n        what about this alternative? */\r\n\r\n        \r\n    \t\t// IF current current character is not opening \r\n    \t\t// bracket, then it must be closing.

But hey...maybe that&#39;s just me.\r\n\r\nWhat a lot of people do is wrap the parsing within a **try/catch** block and trap any errors, something like this:\r\n\r\n    public static int getIntegerFromOctal() {\r\n        Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        String ls = System.lineSeparator();\r\n\r\n        System.out.println(ls + &quot;    - Octal -&quot;);\r\n        while (true) {\r\n            System.out.print(&quot;Input Octal Number:  &quot;);\r\n            String n = s.nextLine();\r\n            int oct = 0;\r\n            try {\r\n                oct = Integer.parseInt(n, 8);\r\n                return oct;\r\n            }\r\n            catch (NumberFormatException ex) {\r\n                System.err.print(&quot;Invalid Octal Value Supplied!
