I setup the small db below with the 2 tables. \r\n\r\nThe `users` table is a table that contains user information on a basic blog system. The `posts` table contains a list of blog posts that are associated with users.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, this would generate a one to many relationship, with each user having several posts. In order to tie a post to a user, I setup the foreign key with the field `author` in the `posts` table referencing the `id` field in the `user` table. I also want to have the ability to delete a user but still leave all their posts there. How can I achieve this?\r\n\r\nRight now my application works the other way around, namely it deletes a post just fine and the user is not affected. How could I do this the other way around? \r\n\r\nAm I correct in the way I organised the tables themselves? Also, I don&#39;t necessarily want to use SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=0 as I&#39;m aware of that one. If foreign_key_checks are disabled, it could lead to further issues down the line right? Of course, assuming my application is limited only to these 2 tables, I should be able to just set the checks to 0 for the purpose of playing around with it, however, if I was to extend it down the line or add additional functionality, this could cause problems (right?) :D\r\n\r\nPS - I&#39;m not adding the Java code since it isn&#39;t relevant right now seeing that this is just a db error that gets thrown my way :( \r\n\r\n```\r\ndrop table if exists `users`;\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `users` (\r\n    `id` int not null auto_increment,\r\n\t`username` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n    `display_name` varchar(50) NOT NULL,\r\n\t`first_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n\t`last_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n    `email` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n\t`password` char(255) NOT NULL,\r\n\tPRIMARY KEY (`id`),\r\n    KEY usr_id (`id`)\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARSET=latin1 auto_increment=1 DEFAULT;\r\n\r\ndrop table if EXISTS `posts`;\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE `posts` (\r\n\t`id` int unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,\r\n    `title` varchar(255),\r\n    `author` int,\r\n    `date` datetime NOT NULL,\r\n    `excerpt` text NOT NULL,\r\n    `featured_media` blob,\r\n    `content` mediumtext NOT NULL,\r\n    `category` varchar(255) NOT NULL,\r\n\tPRIMARY KEY (`id`),\r\n    KEY post_id (`id`),\r\n    FOREIGN KEY (author)\r\n        REFERENCES users(id) \r\n        ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION\r\n) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARSET=latin1 auto_increment=1;\r\n\r\n\r\ninsert into users VALUE (\r\n    &#39;1&#39;,&#39;username&#39;,&#39;UserAuthor&#39;,&#39;AuthorFirstName&#39;,&#39;AuthorLastName&#39;,&#39;author@authoremail.com&#39;,&#39;test12345&#39;);\r\n\r\ninsert into posts (title,author,date,excerpt,featured_media,content,category) VALUE (\r\n    &#39;First Post&#39;,\r\n    &#39;1&#39;,\r\n    &#39;2019-1-18 05:30:50&#39;,\r\n    &#39;This is just an excerpt of the full text below&#39;,\r\n    NULL,\r\n    &#39;This is just an excerpt of the full text below.

You can still have the comments of users who have since deleted their accounts. So in that sense, how is that achieved there? I&#39;m sure foreign keys must be used to link the tables that would hold information tying in users with their comments/posts. I&#39;ve also seen that another option might be to have another column that would show if the user is active or non active. But then from this the problem changes into - how would this work in the context of a java application?

Currently I&#39;m using spark streaming to consume data from kafka and ingesting data to elasticsearch.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519327/combine-two-elasticsearch-index-using-spark","title":"Combine two elasticsearch index using spark"},{"tags":["python"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":421087,"user_id":1968,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Konrad Rudolph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1968/konrad-rudolph"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571825685,"post_id":58519360,"comment_id":103366499,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519326/how-to-read-the-fasta-format-file-and-count-the-sequence-of-letters-inside-the-f/58519360#comment103366499_58519360"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":379,"user_id":680074,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c71a1084c0ba2b12225a949fec526af3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tayyab Gulsher Vohra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/680074/tayyab-gulsher-vohra"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571821932,"creation_date":1571821932,"answer_id":58519360,"question_id":58519326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58519360","body_markdown":"read the fasta format with function and use `count()` for counting the alphabet sequence.\r\n\r\n    from Bio.Seq import Seq\r\n    from Bio.Alphabet import generic_dna, generic_protein\r\n    def read_fasta(fp):\r\n            name, seq = None, []\r\n            for line in fp:\r\n                line = line.rstrip()\r\n                if line.startswith(&quot;&gt;&quot;):\r\n                    if name: yield (name, &#39;&#39;.join(seq))\r\n                    name, seq = line, []\r\n                else:\r\n                    seq.append(line)\r\n            if name: yield (name, &#39;&#39;.join(seq))\r\n    \r\n    with open(&#39;protein.fasta&#39;) as fp:\r\n        for name, seq in read_fasta(fp):\r\n            print(seq.count(&quot;A&quot;))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519326/how-to-read-the-fasta-format-file-and-count-the-sequence-of-letters-inside-the-f/58519360#58519360","title":"How to read the FASTA format file and count the sequence of letters inside the file"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":421087,"user_id":1968,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdd630f72eef3790bfb4ef38d08c7f85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Konrad Rudolph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1968/konrad-rudolph"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571826422,"creation_date":1571826422,"answer_id":58520782,"question_id":58519326,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58520782","body_markdown":"Your code\r\n\r\n* contains a lot of redundancy (by repeating the counting for each letter) that you should automate away\r\n* creates lists of counts instead of counts, for each letter (is this intentional?

When I call ```web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(&#39;txHash&#39;)```, it returns null, so I guess the transaction failed.\r\n\r\nHere is my code:\r\n```\r\nrouter.get(&#39;/&#39;, (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n    // Build a transaction object\r\n    web3.eth.getTransactionCount(ad2, (err, txCount) =&gt; {\r\n        const txObject = {\r\n            nonce: toHex(txCount),\r\n            to: ad1,\r\n            value: toHex(web3.utils.toWei(&#39;1&#39;, &#39;ether&#39;)),\r\n            gasLimit: toHex(21000),\r\n            gasPrice: toHex(web3.utils.toWei(&#39;12&#39;, &#39;gwei&#39;))\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Sign the transaction\r\n        const tx = new Tx(txObject);\r\n        tx.sign(pk2);\r\n\r\n        const serializedTx = tx.serialize();\r\n        const raw = &#39;0x&#39; + serializedTx.toString(&#39;hex&#39;)\r\n\r\n        // Broadchast the transaction to the network\r\n        web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(raw, (err, txHash) =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(&#39;txHash:&#39;, txHash);\r\n\r\n            web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt(txHash, (err, receipt) =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(&#39;receipt: &#39;, receipt);\r\n                \r\n                if (receipt == null) {\r\n                    // Render the page\r\n                    res.render(&#39;sendTransaction&#39;, {\r\n                        receiptSuccess: 0,\r\n                        blockHash: &#39;No Receipt Found&#39;\r\n                    });\r\n                } else {\r\n                    // Render the page\r\n                    res.render(&#39;sendTransaction&#39;, {\r\n                        receiptSuccess: 1,\r\n                        blockHash: receipt.blockHash,\r\n                        blockNumber: receipt.blockNumber,\r\n                        transactionHash: receipt.transactionHash,\r\n                        from: receipt.from,\r\n                        to: receipt.to,\r\n                        contractAddress: receipt.contractAddress,\r\n                        gasUsed: receipt.gasUsed\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\nWhat should I do to send a transaction from an address1 to an address2 successfully?

Get\r\nsome [free coconut water today](/buy/)!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Task\r\n\r\nI want to replace `coconut water` with a link: `[coconut water](/buy/)`. However, some links have been added to the text already (using different versions), I want to add links where they are missing.\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIn human speak, here’s what I’m trying to do:\r\n\r\n- Replace the phrase `coconut water` with `[coconut water](/buy/)`\r\n- Do not replace if it’s already a link (`[coconut water](/buy/)`)\r\n- Do not replace if it’s already in a link (`[free coconut water!](/buy/)`)\r\n\r\n## Attempts\r\n\r\nThe first problem, where it may already be a link, can be avoided using this regex:\r\n\r\n    (?&lt;!\\[)coconut water(?!\\])\r\n\r\nIt works for two our of the three.\r\n\r\n- ✅ Matches `coconut water`\r\n- ✅ Ignores `[coconut water](/buy/)`\r\n- ❌ Matches `[free coconut water today](/buy/)`\r\n\r\nJust for clarity, the last one would turn `[free coconut water today](/buy/)` into `[free [coconut water](/buy/) today](/buy/)`.\r\n\r\n## Next\r\n\r\nThe common reoccurance, because it’s Markdown, is that `]` will always appear at some point after if it’s already a link. So what I can’t figure out is how to say to that to regex:\r\n\r\n_Match the phrase but only if `[` appears before `]` afterwards_\r\n\r\nWhen I’ve searched around Stack Overflow and search engines the most common response is to do with it directly after or before the word, but I want it to be flexible so that it would ignore:\r\n\r\n- `[free coconut water today](/buy/)`\r\n- `[try some coconut water](/buy/)`\r\n- `[lovely coconut water for sale](/buy/)`\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nI’m using PCRE regex in PHP.

Google tries to keep the chrome browser stable by separating each web page into as many processes as it deems fit to ensure that if one process fails on a page, that particular process(es) can be terminated or refreshed without needing to kill or refresh the entire page.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, from 2018 onwards _Google Chrome_ was actually redesigned to create a new process for each of the following entities:\r\n\r\n 1. Tab\r\n 2.  HTML/ASP text on the page\r\n 3. Plugin those are loaded\r\n 4. App those are loaded\r\n 5. Frames within the page\r\n\r\nFurther, in a [Chromium Blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html) it is mentioned:\r\n\r\n&gt;Google Chrome takes advantage of these properties and puts web apps and plug-ins in separate processes from the browser itself.  This means that a rendering engine crash in one web app won&#39;t affect the browser or other web apps.  It means the OS can run web apps in parallel to increase their responsiveness, and it means the browser itself won&#39;t lock up if a particular web app or plug-in stops responding.  It also means we can run the rendering engine processes in a restrictive sandbox that helps limit the damage if an exploit does occur.\r\n\r\nAs a conclusion, the many processes you are seeing is as designed and in-line with the current implementation of **Google Chrome**.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519290/chromedriver-exe-runs-8-chrome-exe-instances/58521183#58521183","title":"chromedriver.exe runs ~8 chrome.exe instances"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":9606223,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a9c4d9db3c0416b67a6ed64eaa7dc4aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Denys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9606223/denys"},"last_editor":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58521183,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571827837,"creation_date":1571821741,"last_edit_date":1571827698,"question_id":58519290,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58519290","body_markdown":"I write UI automation tests using Selenium.

Is that cause for concern?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519265/event-queue-cleanup","title":"Event queue cleanup"},{"tags":["android","google-play","google-play-console"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3274,"user_id":4729721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a68628b01886ee639255e69111990484?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"a_local_nobody","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4729721/a-local-nobody"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571822670,"post_id":58519262,"comment_id":103364866,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519262/problem-with-google-play-developers-multi-accounts#comment103364866_58519262"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7912436,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kZpi8oiCyfs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAK0/FU-R5LsUmII/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Marvan Eimaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7912436/marvan-eimaz"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571821640,"creation_date":1571821640,"question_id":58519262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58519262","body_markdown":"i have problem with google play developers\r\n\r\n**My account has been Terminated more than 30 times**\r\n\r\nthis is my Error:\r\n\r\nThis is a notification that your Google Play Publisher account has been terminated.\r\nREASON FOR TERMINATION: Prior violations of the&#160;Developer Program Policies&#160;and&#160;Developer Distribution Agreement&#160;by this or associated accounts as outlined in previous emails sent to the registered email address(es) of the Publisher account(s).\r\nGoogle Play Publisher suspensions are associated with developers, and may span multiple account registrations and related Google services.\r\nYou can visit the&#160;Developer Policy Center&#160;to better understand how we enforce Developer Program Policies.

I needed to override the default config as the default config was including the type (org.apache.openjpa.util.java$util$Date$proxy) and I added a mixin for this type. But what I actually need to do is add a mixing for java.util.Date because this is the declared type.\r\n\r\nSo now by adding the mixin:\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = Id.NONE)\r\n    public static

I have no access to the client layer, but the structure is right on the server side (so the client can accept)\r\n\r\nC# code uses NetworkStream to write/read.   \r\nJava code uses InputStream &amp; OutputStream to write/read.\r\n\r\nC# code: (the thread method is started via Thread.start)\r\n```\r\npublic override void ReceivingThread(object o)\r\n{\r\n        Client client = (Client)o;\r\n        PacketStream clientStream = client.PacketStream;\r\n        byte[] clientBuffer = new byte[4096];\r\n\r\n        packetHandler.SendFirstPacket(client);\r\n\r\n        while ((!this.Stopped) &amp;&amp; (clientStream.Read(clientBuffer, 0, 8) != 0))\r\n        {\r\n            if (BitConverter.ToInt16(clientBuffer, 6) &gt; 0)\r\n            {\r\n                clientStream.Read(clientBuffer, 8, BitConverter.ToInt16(clientBuffer, 6));\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        Packet packet = new Packet(clientBuffer);\r\n        Console.WriteLine($&quot;RECV [{packet.PacketId:X4}] {BitConverter.ToString(packet.GetRawPacket(), 0, packet.DataLength + 8)}&quot;);\r\n        packetHandler.HandlePacket(client, packet);\r\n    }\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;outside of loop&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nScenario: Server sends first packet, client reads it and sends credentials(in this case), server checks them. To make it easier for now I send a packet with a code indicating that credentials are invalid (code -4 as a short -&gt; 4002). The client accepts it immidiatly and the Thread is discarded. (the &quot;outside of loop&quot; is hit). The client doesn&#39;t hang, nor does the server.\r\n\r\nI replicated or better to say, ported that code and functionality in Java.    \r\nSince in Java you cannot start Threads as methods in form of Thread extending etc. I&#39;m starting the thread with help of Java8 &amp; lambdas. (```new Thread(() -&gt; receivingThread(client)).start();```)\r\n```\r\n@Override\r\npublic void receivingThread(Object o) {\r\n\r\n\tClient client = (Client) o;\r\n\tPacketStream clientStream = client.getPacketStream();\r\n\r\n\tbyte[] clientBuffer = new byte[4096];\r\n\r\n\tpacketHandler.sendWelcomePacket(client);\r\n\r\n\twhile ((!this.stopped) &amp;&amp; (clientStream.read(clientBuffer, 0, 8) != -1)) {\r\n\r\n\t    if (BitKit.bytesToShort(clientBuffer, 6) &gt; -1)\r\n\t\t    clientStream.read(clientBuffer, 8, BitKit.bytesToShort(clientBuffer, 6));\r\n\r\n\t    Packet packet = new Packet(clientBuffer);\r\n\t    logger.info(&quot;RECV [&quot; + String.format(&quot;0x%x&quot;, (int)packet.getPacketId()) + &quot;] &quot; + BitKit.toString(packet.getRawPacket(), 0, packet.getDataLength() + 8));\r\n\r\n\t    packetHandler.handlePacket(client, packet);\r\n\t}\r\n    logger.info(&quot;outside of loop&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNetworkStream.Read returns 0, Java InputStream.read returns -1 for eof.    \r\nThe thing is, in the Java port, it hangs after the second packet is sent. Like somehow the read blocks in some not normal way. I think it&#39;s about a minute or something. Then the client throws an connection error instead of the code I sent with the second write.\r\n\r\nThe streams are setup in constructor of Client class which is passed down. The write and read operations are for raw data -&gt; ```read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int size)```\r\n\r\nAny ideas about it?    \r\nWhy does it work on C# end and not Java? Does C# work with packets differently than Java? Any help is appreciated and thanks in forward!\r\n\r\nP.S: Sorry for the long text :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519198/java-socket-inputstream-read-seems-to-hang","title":"Java

following your comment**\r\n\r\nYou can add a field to the `users/userId` document when you create a doc under the `users/userId/theCollection` collection by modifying the code of the second solution presented below.\r\n\r\nJust trigger at the level of the subcollection, get the parent document `id` through the `context` object and build its `DocumentReference`based on this `id`, as follows:\r\n\r\n    exports.createCounter = functions.firestore.document(&#39;users/{userId}/theCollection/{docId}&#39;).onCreate((snap,\r\n        context) =&gt; {\r\n    \r\n        const id = context.params.userId;\r\n    \r\n        return admin.firestore().collection(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n            .doc(id).set({ counter: 0 }, { merge: true })\r\n            .then(() =&gt; {\r\n                console.log(&quot;Count is created! &quot; + userId);\r\n                return null;\r\n            })\r\n            .catch((error) =&gt; {\r\n                console.error(&quot;Counter Error writing document: &quot;, error);\r\n                return null;\r\n            });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n***************\r\n**Initial answer**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following should do the trick:\r\n\r\n    exports.createCounter = functions.firestore.document(&#39;users/{userId}&#39;).onCreate((snap, \r\n     context) =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;onCreate created&#39;);\r\n    \r\n          const docRef = snap.ref;\r\n    \r\n          return docRef.set({counter: 0}, {merge: true})\r\n              .then(() =&gt; {\r\n                   console.log(&quot;Count is created! &quot;+userId);\r\n                   return null;\r\n               })\r\n              .catch((error) =&gt; {\r\n                   console.error(&quot;Counter Error writing document: &quot;, error);\r\n                   return null;\r\n               });\r\n        });\r\n\r\nNote that instead of doing `snap.data.ref` to get the [`DocumentReference`][1] you have to do `snap.ref`. As a matter of fact, `snap` is a [`DocumentSnapshot`][2] and you need to use its `ref` property.\r\n\r\n**********************\r\n\r\nYour second code snippet should normally work, but you need to return a value in the `then()` and in the `catch()` to indicate to the Cloud Function platform that the work of the function is complete. Note that you need to do the same thing for the above code. I would suggest you watch the 3 videos about &quot;JavaScript Promises&quot; from the Firebase video series: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/video-series/ which explain this key point. \r\n\r\n    exports.createCounter = functions.firestore.document(&#39;users/{userId}&#39;).onCreate((snap, context) =&gt; {\r\n      const id = context.params.userId;\r\n      console.log(&#39;onCreate created&#39;);\r\n      return admin.firestore().collection(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n      .doc(id).set({counter: 0}, {merge: true})\r\n      .then(() =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Document successfully written! &quot;+id);\r\n        return null;\r\n      })\r\n      .catch((error) =&gt; {\r\n          console.error(&quot;Error writing document: &quot;, error);\r\n          return null;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.DocumentReference\r\n  [2]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/firebase.firestore.DocumentSnapshot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58519149/how-to-create-a-new-field-in-firestore-using-cloud-functions/58522792#58522792","title":"How to create a new field in firestore using cloud functions?"}],"owner":{"reputation":138,"user_id":9392701,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04a51d74e23029972c6b2fac3a8fa58f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9392701/marat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":20487,"user_id":3371862,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DyCE6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Renaud Tarnec","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3371862/renaud-tarnec"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58522792,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571839209,"creation_date":1571821252,"last_edit_date":1571838765,"question_id":58519149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58519149","body_markdown":"I am a newbie in cloud functions.

When you start docker on your machine, you need to expose whatever ports you have to use. Think of it this way, if your docker container was a ship. And there was water in the ship how would you get rid of it? You would need to expose a port from the ship to the sea cause to begin with no ports are exposed. So you can&#39;t connect to your `VM because it doesn&#39;t have a port to access it by. \r\n\r\nWhat you can try doing, is pass your hostname in, and edit the file from within the Dockerfile?
