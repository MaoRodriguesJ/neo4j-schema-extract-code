are a few things to adjust in your code:\r\n\r\n* Instead of continuously reassigning `delay` with a new `Timeout` Timer, simply use an `Interval`.\r\n* You should only set the Timer if the state is active **AND** delay does not exist already. *this stops multiple Timers from existing*\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to adjust and understand about Timers in JavaScript:\r\n\r\n* When you set a Timer, the variable that houses the Timer is set to return an Integer. This is the ID of the Timer in the current scope. \r\n* When you clear a Timer, the variable isn&#39;t reset to `undefined` - it stays the same Integer/ID. This is because you&#39;re not *clearing* the variable, the scope is stopping the *Timer* that matches the ID the variable houses. \r\n* Because of the above you have to explicitly set the variable housing the Timer to `undefined` (or some other `falsy` value) *after* clearing it for an existence check to work. \r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var active = false;\r\n    var delay;\r\n\r\n    window.addEventListener(&quot;mousedown&quot;, down, false);\r\n    window.addEventListener(&quot;mouseup&quot;, up, false);\r\n    window.addEventListener(&quot;mousemove&quot;, move, false);\r\n\r\n    function down(e) {\r\n        active = true;\r\n        console.log(&quot;down&quot;)\r\n        window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function up(e) {\r\n        active = false;\r\n        clearTimeout(delay); //expecting this to clear delay\r\n        delay = undefined;\r\n        console.log(&quot;up&quot;)\r\n        window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    function move(e) {\r\n        if (active) {\r\n          if(!delay) {\r\n            delay = setInterval(function() {\r\n                console.log(&quot;move&quot;)\r\n                window.scrollTo(0,document.body.scrollHeight);\r\n            }, 50);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      else { //fallback in case of Browser Queuing issues\r\n       if(delay) { \r\n         clearTimeout(delay);\r\n         delay = undefined;\r\n       }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n**Edited**\r\n\r\nDue to comments with issues I added a fallback in **mousemove** that will remove the timer if the state is inactive, but `delay` is still defined.

My understanding was that each new timer overwrites the previous one but as this is not the case I had to think of something else.\r\n\r\nI did&#39;t really explain what I actually needed to achieve with the delay so let me clarify. I want to create a timeout for an action if that action has not been executed for x amount of time. Using setTimeout on the action it self created the problem that the action would still potentially have multiple queued executions waiting to happen even after mouseup events.\r\n\r\nSo instead I used setTimeout on a new variable that acts as a lock to the action.

is a good question and the answer isn&#39;t very obvious.\r\n\r\nThere are many things to address here. For starters, make sure that you include the \r\nlibraries that you use in your example. I know from experience that you are using `partitions` and `iterpc`. From the `partitions` documentation, we see that there is a function that returns exactly what you are looking for without any additional steps.

was given the assignment to show the population growth of rabbits per month (method), given the 3 variables, one variable for a newborn rabbit, one for a month old rabbit (which can give birth to a pair), and adults. I am uncertain what the syntax would be for calculating the age progression inside the wait method (per month)? Here was my assignment:\r\n- Suppose a newly-born pair of rabbits, one male, one female,\r\nare put in a field. Rabbits are able to mate at the age of one month so that at the end of its second month a female can produce another pair of rabbits. Suppose that our rabbits never die and that the female always produces one new pair (one male, one female) every month from the second month on. How many pairs will there be in ten months?\r\n\r\nSo here was my thought process. The waiting method (month method) in its own class is called 10 times from the main. When called, the newborn babies equal the month babies (they grow up to month babies) and the month babies equal the adults (they grow up to adults) at here, the newborn equals the adults.\r\n\r\n    public RabbitPopulation()\r\n    { // Just a constructor to initialize instance variables\r\n        Newborns = 1;\r\n        MonthBabies = 0;\r\n        Adults = 0;\r\n        NewbornTemp = Newborns;\r\n        MonthBabiesTemp = MonthBabies;\r\n        AdultsTemp = Adults;\r\n        Counter = 0;\r\n    }\r\n    public void MonthWait()\r\n    {\r\n        MonthBabies = Newborns;\r\n        MonthBabies -= MonthBabiesTemp;\r\n        MonthBabiesTemp = MonthBabies;\r\n        Adults += MonthBabies;\r\n        Newborns = Adults;\r\n    }\r\n    // in the main program....\\\\\r\n    int i = 0;\r\n    RabbitPopulation Rabbits = new RabbitPopulation();\r\n    while (i &lt; 10)\r\n    {\r\n        i += 1;\r\n        Rabbits.getPairs(i);\r\n        Rabbits.MonthWait();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI should end up with a result of 89 rabbits after 10 months. However, I end up with 81 and a rabbit dies within the third-month :p (which is not intended, no rabbits die in this assignment). *Please note I am a beginner at C#, don&#39;t batter me please*","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383915/how-to-solve-population-growth-algorithm-of-3-main-variables-based-on-age","title":"How to solve population growth algorithm of 3 main variables (based on age)"},{"tags":["php","webserver"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":156670,"user_id":328193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FnwU5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/328193/david"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571086517,"post_id":58383914,"comment_id":103115949,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383914/updating-the-web-project#comment103115949_58383914"},{"owner":{"reputation":11345,"user_id":1580044,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y2S7p.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Felippe Duarte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1580044/felippe-duarte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571087075,"post_id":58383914,"comment_id":103116161,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383914/updating-the-web-project#comment103116161_58383914"},{"owner":{"reputation":451,"user_id":11430357,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7d48efc19ee524c1ac486e7f32923ca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"catcon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11430357/catcon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571087553,"post_id":58383914,"comment_id":103116285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383914/updating-the-web-project#comment103116285_58383914"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":517,"user_id":10210841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bue02.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rojo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10210841/rojo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571086531,"creation_date":1571086531,"answer_id":58383947,"question_id":58383914,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58383947","body_markdown":"I haven&#39;t tried this, but I think that [XAMPP][1] would do a good job of providing FileZilla FTP.

However, on our 2016 iPad Pro 1st Gen, the app does not crash at all, even after 24 hours of downloading.\r\n\r\nWhen pulling crash logs from the devices, all we see is that CPU usage was over 50% for more than 3 minutes. No other crash logs come up.\r\n\r\nThese devices are all plugged in to power, and have their lock time set to never in order to allow the iPad to remain awake and with our app in the foreground.\r\n\r\nIn an effort to solve this issue, we turned our performance way down, basically waiting 30 seconds in between each image, and 2 full minutes between each batch of images. This worked and the crashing stopped, however, this would take days to download all of our images.\r\n\r\nWe are trying to find a happy medium where the performance is reasonable, and the app does not crash.\r\n\r\nHowever, what is haunting me, is that no matter the setting, and even at full-bore performance, the app never crashes on the older devices, it only crashes on the newer devices.\r\n\r\nConventional wisdom would suggest that should not be possible.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing here?\r\n\r\nWhen I profile using Instruments, I see the app sitting at a comfortable 13% average while downloading, and there is a 20 second gap in between batches, so the iPad should have plenty of time to do any cleanup.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas? Feel free to request additional information, I&#39;m not sure what else would be helpful.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1: Downloader Code Below:**\r\n\r\n    //Assume the following instance variables are set up:\r\n    \r\n    self.operationQueue = NSOperationQueue to download the images.\r\n    \r\n    self.urlSession = NSURLSession with ephemeralSessionConfiguration, 60 second timeoutIntervalForRequest\r\n    \r\n    self.conditions = NSMutableArray to house the NSConditions used below.\r\n    \r\n    self.countRemaining = NSUInteger which keeps track of how many images are left to be downloaded.\r\n    \r\n    //Starts the downloading process by setting up the variables needed for downloading.\r\n    -(void)startDownloading\r\n    {\r\n    \t//If the operation queue doesn&#39;t exist, re-create it here.\r\n    \tif(!self.operationQueue)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tself.operationQueue = [[NSOperationQueue alloc] init];\r\n    \t\t[self.operationQueue addObserver:self forKeyPath:KEY_PATH options:0 context:nil];\r\n    \t\t[self.operationQueue setName:QUEUE_NAME];\r\n    \t\t[self.operationQueue setMaxConcurrentOperationCount:2];\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t//If the session is nil, re-create it here.\r\n    \tif(!self.urlSession)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tself.urlSession = [NSURLSession sessionWithConfiguration:[NSURLSessionConfiguration ephemeralSessionConfiguration]\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdelegate:self\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   delegateQueue:nil];\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \tif([self.countRemaining count] == 0)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\t[self performSelectorInBackground:@selector(startDownloadForNextBatch:) withObject:nil];\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tself.countRemaining = 1;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //Starts each batch.

Finally observed the crash on my iPhone 11 Pro after over an hour downloading images, which matches the scenario reported by my other testers.\r\n\r\nThe Console reports my app was killed specifically for using too much memory. If I am reading this report correctly, my apps used over 2 GB of RAM. I&#39;m assuming that this has to do more with the internal management of NSURLSESSIOND, since it is not showing this leak during debugging with either Xcode or Instruments.\r\n\r\n**Console reports: &quot;kernel\t232912.788 memorystatus: killing_specific_process pid 7075 [PharosSales] (per-process-limit 10) 2148353KB - memorystatus_available_pages: 38718&quot;**\r\n\r\nThankfully, I start receiving memory warnings around the 1 hour mark.

It is a one-shot completely managed thread context, which should not have its own `Looper` attached to it.  That actually will break the backing `AsyncTask` functionality - starving off other future `AsyncTask` operations you may be starting.  If you have something which requires a `Looper`, you should be using your own `Thread` or `ThreadPool` rather than an `AsyncTask`.  You&#39;ll also want to make sure you retain a reference to your `AsyncTask` so it can be cancelled appropriately - this is a source of many memory leaks and/or exceptions due to invalid state when `onPostExecute()` is called.\r\n\r\nThe intent of the `publishProgress()` method is to give your app the ability to get updates it can reflect on the UX.  You are correct, `setText()`, etc. should not be run in the `doInBackground()` callback.  That callback is executed in arbitrary thread context in which you do not control and cannot make UI updates.  \r\n\r\nYou may be able to use `inflateLayout()` and `findViewById()`, but this is not a good practice to do this outside of initialization as these are potentially expensive operations.  Inflation has to parse the binary layout and create view objects on the fly.  Finding by ID walks the entire view hierarchy to find the component you desire.  A better practice would be to cache these at creation (for an `Activity` or `Fragment`) or when creating a view as part of an adapter (such as a `ViewHolder` in `RecyclerView`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383901/what-constitutes-ui-interactions-for-asynctask/58397577#58397577","title":"What constitutes &quot;UI interactions&quot; for AsyncTask?"}],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":6900675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8170d5295f22656e9c30e64d671bd50e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mark Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6900675/mark-brown"},"last_editor":{"reputation":57,"user_id":6900675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8170d5295f22656e9c30e64d671bd50e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mark Brown","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6900675/mark-brown"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58397577,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571151472,"creation_date":1571086208,"last_edit_date":1571148717,"question_id":58383901,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383901","body_markdown":"[AsyncTask](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask) is a standard way to perform long running operations asynchronously on a background thread without holding up the UI thread.  One should not perform any UI interactions from the doInBackground() method.\r\n\r\nMy question: What are examples of UI interactions that are forbidden?  Would it be any of the following:\r\n\r\n - LayoutInflater.inflate()\r\n - View.findViewById()\r\n - TextView.setText()\r\n\r\nI&#39;m inclined to say yes, but we have some code right now that does all of these (and more) and is called from the doInBackground() method, and yet the code is working.  I&#39;ve seen other people indicate they receive an exception when attempting to perform UI activity from doInBackground(), but that is not our experience.\r\n\r\nOur code is generating an on-screen report that is not visible until the entire operation is complete.  On rare occasion (hard to reproduce) when attempting to cancel the operation very quickly, we will see the application get into a weird state, but it doesn&#39;t crash.\r\n\r\nBefore changing our code in hopes of finding this rare condition, I wanted to see if anyone had some thoughts on why our code is &quot;working&quot; as-is.\r\n\r\nThe only other tidbit of information that might be helpful is that our doInBackground method has the following code template:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    protected Boolean doInBackground(Void... voids) {\r\n        if (null == Looper.myLooper()) {\r\n            Looper.prepare();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        publishProgress(0.0);\r\n\r\n        // Perform ui/non-ui logic here\r\n\r\n        Looper myLooper = Looper.myLooper();\r\n        if (null != myLooper &amp;&amp; Looper.getMainLooper() != myLooper) {\r\n            myLooper.quit();\r\n        }\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Looper is needed for some of the report generating code (omitted) that uses a **new Handler()** to generate data.  I&#39;m not sure if creating the Looper is somehow making our ui interactions legal.\r\n\r\n(I do have a stack trace that clearly shows our UI activity being called from doInBackground, in case you thought we might be spinning off some separate threads to update our UI)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383901/what-constitutes-ui-interactions-for-asynctask","title":"What constitutes &quot;UI interactions&quot; for AsyncTask?"},{"tags":["r","sf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1251,"user_id":6935834,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iG0Wf.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6935834/majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571095059,"post_id":58383900,"comment_id":103118185,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383900/geometry-inconsistencies-after-computing-intersection#comment103118185_58383900"},{"owner":{"reputation":77092,"user_id":211116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf422e96227ee42abf42188feee10d9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Spacedman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211116/spacedman"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571138824,"post_id":58383900,"comment_id":103132945,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383900/geometry-inconsistencies-after-computing-intersection#comment103132945_58383900"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12216876,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-KAt2ZkYRCUw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rddU-qLPuOjjeilwDQgF1MKp94vBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tim W","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216876/tim-w"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":77092,"user_id":211116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cf422e96227ee42abf42188feee10d9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Spacedman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211116/spacedman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571163431,"post_id":58383900,"comment_id":103146248,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383900/geometry-inconsistencies-after-computing-intersection#comment103146248_58383900"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3956,"user_id":6871135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6f1e3990eec2eb3b4f8a1233b8098c4c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lbusett","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6871135/lbusett"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571147243,"creation_date":1571147243,"answer_id":58396242,"question_id":58383900,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58396242","body_markdown":"Comment by @Spacedman seems to be correct.

The closest I&#39;ve been able to get is using Future for something like this:\r\n\r\n    func loadWidgets() -&gt; AnyPublisher&lt;[Widget], Error&gt; {\r\n      return Future&lt;[Widget], Error&gt; { resolve in\r\n        // start the request when someone subscribes\r\n        let loadTask = WidgetLoader.request(&quot;allWidgets&quot;, completion: { widgets in\r\n          // publish result on success\r\n          resolve(.success(widgets))\r\n        }, error: { error in\r\n          // publish error on failure\r\n          resolve(.failure(error))\r\n        })\r\n        // allow cancellation ???\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you can see, it does most of it, but there&#39;s no ability to cancel.\r\nSecondarily, future doesn&#39;t allow multiple results.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to do something like the Rx `Observable.create` pattern which allows cancellation and optionally multiple results?\r\n    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383895/swift-combine-alternative-to-rx-observable-create","title":"Swift Combine alternative to Rx Observable.create"},{"tags":["c","multithreading","semaphore"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22506,"user_id":758133,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/W8X5E.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Martin James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/758133/martin-james"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571086745,"post_id":58383892,"comment_id":103116030,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383892/converting-pthread-join-to-use-semaphores-instead#comment103116030_58383892"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11393724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1d65a7886f2ed97e26dc384f5c814774?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alec Tenefrancia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11393724/alec-tenefrancia"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571086152,"creation_date":1571086152,"question_id":58383892,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383892","body_markdown":"I am trying to understand the usage of semaphores in threads and want to try to convert a piece of code using pthread_join to wait for a thread to finish to use semaphores instead.

though you are a beginner, I would suggest you probably heavily retool this. Start with your database connection. `mysql_` functions are deprecated (not recommended for use) in the latest v5 of PHP and removed altogether in PHP v7 because they are security risk and are poorly implemented by most. Use PDO or MySQLi instead. I prefer [PDO][1], so I will demonstrate that:\r\n\r\n    # Create the connection thusly, fill in your own credentials\r\n    $con = new \\PDO(&quot;mysql:host=localhost;dbname=mydatabase&quot;, $username, $password);\r\n\r\nNext, you should know the difference between `isset` and `empty`. In your case, your `isset` will throw a warning if `$_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]` is not set. When you create your own variable, it&#39;s guaranteed to be set when you check it because you manually just created it.\r\n\r\nThis will throw a warning if `$_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]` is not set because you assign it before you check it:\r\n\r\n    $category = htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]);\r\n\r\nThis WILL NOT throw a warning because you are checking if `$_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]` is set yet. If not, assign `$category` to `false` by default:\r\n\r\n    # I like to use a ternary when there are only two options, but you can use if/else\r\n    $category = (isset($_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]))? htmlspecialchars(trim($_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;])) : false;\r\n\r\n    # This part now checks if the value that you created is NOT EMPTY because you\r\n    # have just created it, so checking if it is set is illogical\r\n    if(!empty($category)):\r\n        # Now we use our connection here to query.\r\n        # Here we can use query() because we don&#39;t have any variables to add into the query,\r\n        # so it&#39;s safe to use this short version\r\n        $avt = $con-&gt;query(&quot;select * from  category order by id asc&quot;);\r\n        # Same while loop, just use the PDO version of fetching the results\r\n        while($category_id = $avt-&gt;fetch(\\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)): ?&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;?php\r\n            /**\r\n             * I&#39;m not sure why you are using a &quot;k&quot; tag, so just combine with &quot;a&quot; tag\r\n             * also, though you can use &lt;? as a php open, it&#39;s not recommended\r\n             * lastly, you have the close tag for &quot;a&quot; outside the loop, that is bad syntax\r\n             * since the open is inside the loop\r\n             */\r\n            ?&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; style=&quot;font-size: 11px;&quot;&gt;&lt;?php echo $category_id[&#39;catname&#39;] ?&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;?php endwhile ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;?php endif ?&gt;\r\n\r\nNow that the top part is finished, you have the same issues (plus a couple more) on this second part of the code:\r\n\r\n    # It&#39;s also worth noting here you have set this variable, but you don&#39;t actually use it...?\r\n    # Secondly, you are checking for &quot;subcategory&quot; here, but in the code below you are injecting &quot;subcat_id&quot;...should they match??\r\n    $subcategory = (isset($_REQUEST[&#39;subcategory&#39;]))? htmlspecialchars(trim($_REQUEST[&#39;subcategory&#39;])) : false;\r\n    \r\n    if(!empty($subcategory)):\r\n        # Here is where you need to make a detour with your script. What you are doing is unsafe.\r\n        # You can not inject that value right into the sql. You need to &quot;prepare&quot;, &quot;bind value&quot;, and &quot;execute&quot; it\r\n        $subcat_id = $_REQUEST[&#39;subcat_id&#39;];\r\n        # First prepare using ? as placeholders for the value you want to search for\r\n        # The naming convention on the &quot;subcat_id&quot; column I assume is actually the\r\n        # the parent category? If so, maybe it should be called &quot;parent_id&quot; or &quot;category_id&quot;??\r\n        $sql = $con-&gt;prepare(&quot;SELECT t1.*, t2.* FROM category as t1, subcategory as t2 WHERE t1.id = ? AND t2.subcat_id = ?&quot;);\r\n        # Now you want to execute for those two question marks (?)\r\n        # There are a few ways to prepare and bind parameters, this way is easy\r\n        # and you can visually see what we are trying to accomplish\r\n        $sql-&gt;execute([$subcat_id, $subcat_id]) ?&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- you probably don&#39;t want to be looping this (or it&#39;s close tag) --&gt;\r\n        &lt;ul style=&quot;z-index:101;&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;?php\r\n        # Same type of thing as your first block of code\r\n        while($data = $sql-&gt;fetch(\\PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)): ?&gt;\r\n    \r\n            &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;index.php?do=cat&amp;id=&lt;?php echo $data[&#39;id&#39;] ?&gt;&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid #CECECE; position:relative; left:-40px; font-size:11px; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;?php echo $data[&quot;subcat_name&quot;] ?&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \r\n    \r\n        &lt;?php endwhile ?&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;!-- end list --&gt;\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;?php endif ?&gt;\r\n\r\nThe final conclusion here is that you have some work to be done before you get to the main problem which is likely your SQL statement and the value you are querying. I would suggest reading up on any of the concepts mentioned that you are not familiar with.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.connections.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383887/category-and-subcategory-does-not-match/58399602#58399602","title":"Category and subcategory does not match"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12170025,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/80221ca7d4f9acfa83d4a947fcddd9a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pa-Sha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170025/pa-sha"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11345,"user_id":1580044,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y2S7p.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Felippe Duarte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1580044/felippe-duarte"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571159297,"creation_date":1571086139,"last_edit_date":1571087233,"question_id":58383887,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383887","body_markdown":"I have issues with category and subcategory fields. \r\n\r\nshortly, I made category like this: **literature**, and want to make drop down sub menu like this: **poetry, novel, non-fiction.** \r\n\r\nI receive all the categories on the website, but can&#39;t get subcategory field at all.\r\n\r\nHere is my code: \r\n\r\n ```       &lt;?\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t  $category=htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST[&#39;category&#39;]);\r\nif(isset($category)){\r\n\t $avt=mysql_query(&quot;select * from  category order by id asc&quot;);\r\n\t while($category_id=mysql_fetch_array($avt))\r\n\t {\r\n\t\t ?&gt; \r\n         \r\n         &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt; &lt;k style=&quot;font-size:11px;&quot;&gt; &lt;? \r\n\techo $category_id[&#39;catname&#39;];\t\t\t \r\n\t } }\r\n     ?&gt;  &lt;/k&gt; &lt;/a&gt; \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      &lt;?\r\n\t  \r\n\t   \r\n  \r\n\t  $subcategory=htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST[&#39;subcategory&#39;]);\r\nif(isset($subcategory)){\r\n\t $sql = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT t1.*,t2.* FROM category as t1, subcategory as t2 WHERE t1.id=t2.&#39;$_REQUEST[subcat_id]&#39;&quot;);\r\nwhile($data = mysql_fetch_array($sql))\r\n   \r\n\t { ?&gt;\r\n     \r\n     \r\n     &lt;ul style=&quot;z-index:101;&quot;&gt;\r\n \t&lt;li&gt; &lt;k&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;index.php?do=cat&amp;id=&lt;? echo $data[&#39;id&#39;];?&gt;&quot; style=&quot;border-bottom:1px solid #CECECE; position:relative; left:-40px; font-size:11px; &quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;?php echo $data[&quot;subcat_name&quot;]; ?&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &lt;/k&gt;&lt;/li&gt; \r\n\t\t\t \r\n\t&lt;?  } }\r\n\t \r\n     ?&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is the mysql: \r\n\r\n**category**\r\n\r\n    id\r\n    catname\r\n\r\n**Subcategory**\r\n\r\n    id\r\n    subcat_id\r\n    subcat_name\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s all.

It&#39;s quite possibly staring me in the face but I can&#39;t see it!\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a snippet for the row and column:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-8 col-md-6 white-rect mr-4  &quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;ul&gt;\r\n                                &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                    Book flights.\r\n                                &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                                &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn my-primary btn-sm my-small-btn&quot;&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/button&gt;\r\n                        \r\n                                &lt;button type=&quot;button&quot; class=&quot;btn my-primary2 btn-sm my-small-btn&quot;&gt; DELETE &lt;/button&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;```\r\n\r\n    And here&#39;s the code for the the row with the buttons that are aligned in desktop but are effectively floating outside a column:\r\n\r\n    ```&lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-8 col-md-6 white-rect mr-4&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;ul&gt;\r\n                                &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                    Reschdule Twitter Meeting.\r\n                                &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;button type=&quot;.button&quot; class=&quot;btn my-primary btn-sm my-small-btn&quot;&gt;COMPLETE&lt;/button&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-sm-1 col-xs-1 col-md-1 col-lg-1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;button type=&quot;.button&quot; class=&quot;btn my-primary2 btn-sm my-small-btn&quot;&gt; DELETE &lt;/button&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot of the page][1]][1]\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pXlsG.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383884/placing-aligned-buttons-inside-column-next-to-text-box","title":"Placing aligned buttons inside column next to text box"},{"tags":["python-3.x","sorting"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12216724,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mArtE4rIa4zNIQ0MTCs1XFTkFe7z5nouptT2Cb-=k-s128","display_name":"John Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216724/john-smith"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1571087184,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571086110,"creation_date":1571086110,"question_id":58383883,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383883","body_markdown":"In the following code I run the sort method and it works perfectly except for one single problem.

starts with `../binutils`) is a separate command or not, I thought that maybe the two dots (`..`) meant that it is a continuation of the third command and they were connected together.  I decided to type it separately anyway, and when I do I get this:\r\n\r\n`bash: ../binutils-x.y.z/configure: No such file or directory`\r\n\r\nI dont know why I am getting this, I thought maybe it&#39;s because line 4 and line 3 are connected. I tried typing them both as one command and I got:\r\n\r\n`bash: too many arguments`\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know what I am doing wrong? I cant really understand the line 4 instruction.

ES6 module syntax in the browser is currently only supported with paths as specifiers  because it&#39;s not yet clear how bare specifiers are going to get resolved to URLs.\r\n\r\n* Other specifiers are reserved for future-use, such as importing built-in modules.\r\n* The nodejs module resolution algorithm cannot be replicated because it requires testing for file existence, which is reasonable

Most of the times when I find a solution that works in Xamarin.Forms and I try to do the same thing in Xamarin.Android I end up just figuring out the problem myself in Xamarin.Android from scratch.  \r\n\r\nWhen they say that 90% is shared, they mean that within Xamarin.Forms... 90% of the work on your models and code behind can be shared between the projects (within that Xamarin.Forms solution) and 10% will have to be custom tailored for each platform (UWP, Android, iOS)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383853/can-xamarin-apps-be-built-for-windows-macos-with-same-source-code/58383986#58383986","title":"Can xamarin apps be built for Windows, MacOS with same source code?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":58973,"user_id":4984832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be4bc3e019d1082f7945b8db7ab313c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"SushiHangover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4984832/sushihangover"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571087717,"creation_date":1571087717,"answer_id":58384162,"question_id":58383853,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384162","body_markdown":"You can add a MacOS target for your `Xamarin.Forms`-based UI, of course, this is done via Visual Studio for Mac:\r\n\r\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/platform/other/mac\r\n\r\nThere are items within Forms that are not feature complete on MacOS and thus it is still in a &quot;Preview&quot; release and those are listed on the &quot;Platform Support macOS Status&quot; wiki:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/wiki/Platform-Support-macOS-Status\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383853/can-xamarin-apps-be-built-for-windows-macos-with-same-source-code/58384162#58384162","title":"Can xamarin apps be built for Windows, MacOS with same source code?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11017,"user_id":1022836,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpr3x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peri Hartman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1022836/peri-hartman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571093404,"post_id":58384952,"comment_id":103117786,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383853/can-xamarin-apps-be-built-for-windows-macos-with-same-source-code/58384952#comment103117786_58384952"},{"owner":{"reputation":5516,"user_id":202179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xibo7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Ičin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202179/ivan-i%c4%8din"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11017,"user_id":1022836,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mpr3x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peri Hartman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1022836/peri-hartman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571093477,"post_id":58384952,"comment_id":103117805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383853/can-xamarin-apps-be-built-for-windows-macos-with-same-source-code/58384952#comment103117805_58384952"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5516,"user_id":202179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xibo7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Ičin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202179/ivan-i%c4%8din"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5516,"user_id":202179,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xibo7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ivan Ičin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202179/ivan-i%c4%8din"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571093408,"last_edit_date":1571093408,"creation_date":1571093232,"answer_id":58384952,"question_id":58383853,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384952","body_markdown":"As long as you use .Net code and Xamarin.Forms it is 100% portable/sharable across every single project.

When an item is dequeued, it&#39;s corresponding resources should be released. As an exercise, think about the scenario where `ItemType` is `std::unique_ptr` (or `std::shared_ptr`).

This is addressed completely by this part of your code:\r\n\r\n    add(0,X,X).\r\n    add(s(X),Y,s(Z)) :- add(X,Y,Z).\r\n\r\nNow you have to make a decision; you can either handle the predecessors and the addition terms here, in `add/3`, or you can wrap this predicate in another one that will handle them. You appear to have chosen to wrap `add/3` with `add2/3`. In that case, you will definitely need to create a reducing term, such as you&#39;ve built here with `resolve/2`, and I agree with your implementation of _part_ of it:\r\n\r\n    resolve(0,0).\r\n    resolve(s(X),s(Y)) :-\r\n        resolve(X,Y).\r\n    resolve(X+Y,Z) :-\r\n        resolve(X,RX),\r\n        resolve(Y,RY),\r\n        add(RX,RY,Z).\r\n\r\nThis is all good. What you&#39;re missing now is a way to handle `p(X)` terms. The right way to do this is to notice that you already have a way of deducting by one, by using `add/3` with `s(0)`:\r\n\r\n    resolve(p(X), R) :-\r\n        resolve(X, X1),\r\n        add(s(0), R, X1).\r\n\r\nIn other words, instead of computing X using X = Y - 1, we are computing X using X + 1 = Y.\r\n\r\nProvided your inputs are never negative, your `add2/3` predicate will now work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383837/prolog-predecessor-math/58384063#58384063","title":"Prolog predecessor math"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12216688,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-epX4tn792rc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfEdL9MGUGum5ApBweH0XxYQgFGQA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arwin Smithy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12216688/arwin-smithy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10086,"user_id":772868,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dt3Kv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"false","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/772868/false"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571144158,"creation_date":1571085819,"last_edit_date":1571144158,"question_id":58383837,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383837","body_markdown":"I have an `add2` predicate which resolves like this where `s(0)` is the successor of `0` i.e `1`\r\n\r\n    ?- add2(s(0)+s(s(0)), s(s(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = s(s(s(s(s(0)))))\r\n    \r\n    ?- add2(0, s(0)+s(s(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = s(s(s(0)))\r\n    \r\n    ?- add2(s(s(0)), s(0)+s(s(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = s(s(s(s(s(0)))))\r\netc..\r\n\r\n    \r\nI&#39;m trying to do add  in a predecessor predicate which will work like so \r\n\r\n    ?- add2(p(s(0)), s(s(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = s(s(0))\r\n    \r\n    ?- add2(0, s(p(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = 0\r\n    \r\n    ?- add2(p(0)+s(s(0)),s(s(0)),Z).\r\n    Z = s(s(s(0)))\r\n    \r\n    ?- add2(p(0), p(0)+s(p(0)), Z).\r\n    Z = p(p(0))\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t seem to find a way to do this.

I do not know how to do it. I do not know how to use addSubtitleSource, addTimedTextSource methods properly and if they are correct.\r\n\r\nAndroid documentation says that addTimedTextSource is used only with MediaPlayer (which VideoView isn&#39;t) but there are some information about track i.e. getTrackInfo and others. I do not know where to start. There are some solutions in the internet but I do not understand those code snippets and I think they do not give an easy solutions.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody can help me?\r\n\r\n**Let&#39;s have a simple VideoView with video attached.

I put the &quot;android.resource://&quot; + getPackageName() + &quot;/&quot;+R.raw.sub path to the file but it gives me an error E/TaskPersister: File error accessing recents directory (directory doesn&#39;t exist?). Later I moved it to the assets folder but the result was the same. What&#39;s wrong?\r\n2. I&#39;ve added the mp.selectTrack(2); with index = 2 because I read somewhere that this is obligatory and for the videos getTrackInfo returns 2 in most cases.\r\n3. In the end I thought that txtDisplay.setText() method will be OK. Is it?\r\n\r\nPlease tell me, is only 1 the issue here or more?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383822/how-to-add-subtitles-to-videoview","title":"How to add subtitles to VideoView?"},{"tags":["c#","double","logarithm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":63538,"user_id":11683,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4d284c3c214d52f004df795aee394e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GSerg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11683/gserg"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571085948,"post_id":58383821,"comment_id":103115737,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383821/rounding-behaviour-of-math-log#comment103115737_58383821"},{"owner":{"reputation":19546,"user_id":1410664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vGygm.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caius Jard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1410664/caius-jard"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571086021,"post_id":58383821,"comment_id":103115766,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383821/rounding-behaviour-of-math-log#comment103115766_58383821"},{"owner":{"reputation":63538,"user_id":11683,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4d284c3c214d52f004df795aee394e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GSerg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11683/gserg"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571086071,"post_id":58383821,"comment_id":103115787,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383821/rounding-behaviour-of-math-log#comment103115787_58383821"},{"owner":{"reputation":23278,"user_id":1798593,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be41e365336e709f1bfc2c9866eac8e9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Patricia Shanahan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1798593/patricia-shanahan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571099374,"post_id":58383821,"comment_id":103118934,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383821/rounding-behaviour-of-math-log#comment103118934_58383821"}],"owner":{"reputation":2593,"user_id":2077201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BiYVI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2077201/adam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2593,"user_id":2077201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BiYVI.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2077201/adam"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571086137,"creation_date":1571085741,"last_edit_date":1571086137,"question_id":58383821,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383821","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to determine if a give integer `n` is a power of three.

Unfortunately, my code isn&#39;t based on yours, but I hope you can follow it nevertheless. The main approach is exactly the same as you described in your question.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s have a look at the code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport cv2\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\n# Some image; get width and height\r\nimage = cv2.resize(cv2.imread(&#39;path/to/your/image.png&#39;), (512, 383))\r\nh, w = image.shape[:2]\r\n\r\n# Tile parameters\r\nwTile = 100\r\nhTile = 100\r\n\r\n# Number of tiles\r\nnTilesX = np.uint8(np.ceil(w / wTile))\r\nnTilesY = np.uint8(np.ceil(h / hTile))\r\n\r\n# Total remainders\r\nremainderX = nTilesX * wTile - w\r\nremainderY = nTilesY * hTile - h\r\n\r\n# Set up remainders per tile\r\nremaindersX = np.ones((nTilesX-1, 1)) * np.uint16(np.floor(remainderX / (nTilesX-1)))\r\nremaindersY = np.ones((nTilesY-1, 1)) * np.uint16(np.floor(remainderY / (nTilesY-1)))\r\nremaindersX[0:np.remainder(remainderX, np.uint16(nTilesX-1))] += 1\r\nremaindersY[0:np.remainder(remainderY, np.uint16(nTilesY-1))] += 1\r\n\r\n# Initialize array of tile boxes\r\ntiles = np.zeros((nTilesX * nTilesY, 4), np.uint16)\r\n\r\n# Determine proper tile boxes\r\nk = 0\r\nx = 0\r\nfor i in range(nTilesX):\r\n    y = 0\r\n    for j in range(nTilesY):\r\n        tiles[k, :] = (x, y, hTile, wTile)\r\n        k += 1\r\n        if (j &lt; (nTilesY-1)):\r\n            y = y + hTile - remaindersY[j]\r\n    if (i &lt; (nTilesX-1)):\r\n        x = x + wTile - remaindersX[i]\r\n\r\nprint(tiles)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor some image with dimensions `[512, 383]` and tile size `[100, 100]`, the `tiles` array looks like this:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n[[  0   0 100 100]\r\n [  0  94 100 100]\r\n [  0 188 100 100]\r\n [  0 283 100 100]\r\n [ 82   0 100 100]\r\n [ 82  94 100 100]\r\n [ 82 188 100 100]\r\n [ 82 283 100 100]\r\n [164   0 100 100]\r\n [164  94 100 100]\r\n [164 188 100 100]\r\n [164 283 100 100]\r\n [246   0 100 100]\r\n [246  94 100 100]\r\n [246 188 100 100]\r\n [246 283 100 100]\r\n [329   0 100 100]\r\n [329  94 100 100]\r\n [329 188 100 100]\r\n [329 283 100 100]\r\n [412   0 100 100]\r\n [412  94 100 100]\r\n [412 188 100 100]\r\n [412 283 100 100]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get 24 tiles, each of size `[100, 100]` and most similar overlaps possible.\r\n\r\nIf we switch to some image with dimensions `[500, 300]`, we get these `tiles`:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n[[  0   0 100 100]\r\n [  0 100 100 100]\r\n [  0 200 100 100]\r\n [100   0 100 100]\r\n [100 100 100 100]\r\n [100 200 100 100]\r\n [200   0 100 100]\r\n [200 100 100 100]\r\n [200 200 100 100]\r\n [300   0 100 100]\r\n [300 100 100 100]\r\n [300 200 100 100]\r\n [400   0 100 100]\r\n [400 100 100 100]\r\n [400 200 100 100]]\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are only 15 tiles left, and no overlaps at all.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383814/how-to-divide-an-image-into-evenly-sized-overlapping-if-needed-tiles/58387766#58387766","title":"How to divide an image into evenly sized, overlapping if needed, tiles?"}],"owner":{"reputation":719,"user_id":5381605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5ZF_yJyjvcQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFM/lQbQAZxe2wo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"binarymason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5381605/binarymason"},"last_editor":{"reputation":719,"user_id":5381605,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-5ZF_yJyjvcQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFM/lQbQAZxe2wo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"binarymason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5381605/binarymason"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58387766,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571132875,"creation_date":1571085688,"last_edit_date":1571132875,"question_id":58383814,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58383814","body_markdown":"I have an image with that has height/width dimensions of 3837x5126 pixels, respectively.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to divide this image into separate tiles with the exact dimensions of 1000x1000 pixels.

I don&#39;t know which one to go with.\r\nAnd as far as the problems with large numbers go, I just need to make large base 10 numbers stay stable, not get scientific notation, and still be able to be processed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383784/debugging-a-base-conversion-calculator-up-to-base-809","title":"Debugging a base conversion calculator up to base 809"},{"tags":["swiftui"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":847,"user_id":2335677,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DOR6z.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"gnarlybracket","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2335677/gnarlybracket"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571087480,"creation_date":1571087480,"answer_id":58384123,"question_id":58383783,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384123","body_markdown":"[This answer][1] helped me.

your question is not exactly clear on this I suspect you came across something 2 special methods with JavaScript classes that are automatically being called when an object is converted to a string or is compared with another value:\r\n\r\n- [toString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString)\r\n- [valueOf()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/valueOf)\r\n\r\nGiven the following class we can play around with these:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin

need to admit that recursion is wrong and broken, and should never be used.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you add something to stop the recursion (e.g. `if(k == 0) return 1;`) **it will still cause segmentation faults for large values of `k`** (e.g. if you do `x = power(1.0, INT_MAX)`).\r\n\r\nFor this case, it&#39;s trivial to convert it into a simple loop; like:\r\n\r\n        float power(float n, int k) {\r\n            float result = 1.0;\r\n            while(k &gt; 0) {\r\n                result *= n;\r\n                k--;\r\n            }\r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nHowever even though this is no longer horribly bad because of recursion, it&#39;s still not good because the algorithm is inefficient (especially for large values of `k`).\r\n\r\nA more efficient algorithm is something like:\r\n\r\n        float power(float n, unsigned int k) {\r\n            float result = 1.0;\r\n            while(k &gt; 0) {\r\n                if( (k &amp; 1) != 0) {\r\n                    result *= n;\r\n                }\r\n                k &gt;&gt;= 1;\r\n                n *= n;\r\n            }\r\n            return result;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nFor this version, with a large value of `k` like 50000 the loop will only be executed 16 times instead of 49999 times, which makes it significantly faster.\r\n\r\nOf course you can make the efficient version bad again by using recursion, like this:\r\n\r\n        float power(float n, unsigned int k) {\r\n            float result = 1.0;\r\n\r\n             if(k &gt; 1) {\r\n                 result = power(n*n, k &gt;&gt; 1);\r\n             }\r\n             if( (k &amp; 1) != 0) {\r\n                result *= n;\r\n             }\r\n             return result;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIn this case, (instead of being significantly more efficient because it loops a lot less) it will be significantly more efficient because it recurses a lot less (and then slightly less efficient because recursion sucks); and &quot;recurses a lot less&quot; is important because it means that it&#39;s far less likely that large values of `k` will make it crash.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383778/how-can-i-use-the-recursion-formula-to-get-a-power-without-it-giving-me-segmenta/58384018#58384018","title":"How can I use the

I have spent a day wrestling with getting one of the projects to work properly in Azure DevOps and I give up.\r\n\r\nWhen I work with one particular unit test project locally, it sets up this directory structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ ProjectName\r\n    + bin\r\n    + obj\r\n    + ...\r\n+ packages\r\n    + &lt;nuget packages here&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis structure manifests itself in parts of the project file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &lt;Import Project=&quot;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit3TestAdapter.3.15.1\\build\\net35\\NUnit3TestAdapter.props&quot; Condition=&quot;Exists(&#39;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit3TestAdapter.3.15.1\\build\\net35\\NUnit3TestAdapter.props&#39;)&quot; /&gt;\r\n  &lt;Import Project=&quot;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit.3.12.0\\build\\NUnit.props&quot; Condition=&quot;Exists(&#39;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit.3.12.0\\build\\NUnit.props&#39;)&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s another part of the project file that depends on this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  &lt;Target Name=&quot;EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports&quot; BeforeTargets=&quot;PrepareForBuild&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n      &lt;ErrorText&gt;This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer. Use NuGet Package Restore to download them.  For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=322105. The missing file is {0}.&lt;/ErrorText&gt;\r\n    &lt;/PropertyGroup&gt;\r\n    &lt;Error Condition=&quot;!Exists(&#39;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit.3.12.0\\build\\NUnit.props&#39;)&quot; Text=&quot;$([System.String]::Format(&#39;$(ErrorText)&#39;, &#39;..\\packages\\NUnit.3.12.0\\build\\NUnit.props&#39;))&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;Error Condition=&quot;!Exists(&#39;..\\..\\packages\\NUnit3TestAdapter.3.15.1\\build\\net35\\NUnit3TestAdapter.props&#39;)&quot; Text=&quot;$([System.String]::Format(&#39;$(ErrorText)&#39;, &#39;..\\packages\\NUnit3TestAdapter.3.15.1\\build\\net35\\NUnit3TestAdapter.props&#39;))&quot; /&gt;\r\n  &lt;/Target&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I build this locally, everything is fine. The project builds. The tests pass. When I build this in Azure DevOps, it fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(EnsureNuGetPackageBuildImports target) -&gt; \r\n  D:\\a\\1\\s\\[Redacted].Unit.Tests\\[Redacted].Unit.Tests.csproj(97,5): error : This project references NuGet package(s) that are missing on this computer. Use NuGet Package Restore to download them.  For more information, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=322105. The missing file is ..\\..\\packages\\NUnit.3.12.0\\build\\NUnit.props.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo clearly Azure DevOps has a different idea of where the `packages` folder is created. If I edit the `..\\..` to `..\\`, everything works. This is consistent with a lot of projects.  In several of my other projects, all of the .csproj files use `..\\` and they have this directory structure:\r\n\r\n```\r\n+ ProjectName\r\n    + bin\r\n    + obj\r\n    + packages\r\n    + ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find anything in either `.csproj` that seems to indicate either one is instructing nuget to do anything differently. But it&#39;s behaving VERY differently for each one. My only guess is I have some super-hidden local config for the &quot;broken&quot; one that changes the default behavior, and that file&#39;s not in source control so DevOps uses the &quot;real&quot; default? \r\n\r\nWhat could be causing this to happen?\r\n\r\nSome people asked for the .yml to see how we&#39;re restoring packages: I believe this is it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - task: NuGetToolInstaller@1\r\n    displayName: &quot;Install nuget&quot;\r\n    inputs:\r\n      versionSpec: &#39;4.4.1&#39;\r\n\r\n  - task: NuGetCommand@2\r\n    displayName: &#39;restore $(solution)&#39;\r\n    inputs:\r\n      restoreSolution: &#39;$(solution)&#39;\r\n      vstsFeed: &quot;$(packageFeedName)&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not *the* devops guy for the team, but I know a *little* about the yml. `$(solution)` is just a path to our solution file, and the package feed name is what it says it is. They seem pretty straightforward to me.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383759/how-does-nuget-decide-where-to-put-the-packages-directory","title":"How does NuGet decide where to put

Now, let&#39;s say I have an Employee entity. We also need to implement the Employee&#39;s position in some way (an employee can have the position of a back-end developer, front-end developer, project manager etc.).

-split &#39;Year=&#39;` effectively yields array `&#39;&#39;, &#39; YYYY&#39;`, and calling `.Trim()` on it trims the individual elements, so you end up with `&#39;&#39;, &#39;YYYY&#39;`.\r\n\r\nIf you print that to the console via PowerShell&#39;s _implicit output_, you can get an _empty line_, followed by `YYYY`, which is also what you would get if you used `Write-Output $Year`.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, if you use `Write-Host`, PowerShell _stringifies_ the array by concatenating its elements with spaces (by default, can be changed with `$OFS`), so you got `&#160;YYYY`.\r\n\r\nTo put it differently:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; Write-Host (&#39;&#39;, &#39;YYYY&#39;)\r\n YYYY  # concatenation of: empty string, space, &#39;YYYY&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nis by default implicitly the same as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS&gt; Write-Host ((&#39;&#39;, &#39;YYYY&#39;) -join &#39;

(No leading space); but when I use Write-Host I get &quot; YYYY&quot; (has a leading space).\r\n\r\nIt is important that I be able to put $Year $Month next to eathother without a space for filepath and file naming reasons. (i.e. .\\YYYY\\MM or YYYYMM.txt).\r\n\r\nI have tried:\r\n\r\n     Write-Host &quot;Example: $Year\\$Month&quot;\r\n     Write-Host &quot;Example: &quot; $Year &quot;\\&quot; $Month\r\n     Write-Host (&quot;Example: $($Year)\\$($Month)&quot;)\r\n     Write-Host &quot;Example: $Year\\&quot; + $Month&quot;\r\n     Write-Host &quot;Example: $Year\\&quot; -f $Month&quot;\r\n\r\n     ....and several ways of implementing .trim() with no success.\r\n\r\nIf the problem is not in the Write-Host line, then the only other thing I can think of is that it must be with how the data is written into the variables.  Please keep in mind, this is only an example, my actual problem is larger.  This is just a simple example of what I need to accomplish.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK UPDATE:\r\n     I found a long workaround like this:\r\n\r\n\tWrite-Host &quot;$Year\\&quot; -nonewline\r\n\tWrite-Host &quot;$Month\\&quot;.trim() -nonewline\r\n\tWrite-Host &quot;$Day\\&quot;.trim() -nonewline\r\nBUT there has to be a better way to do this.  I am using about 8 variables in my actual code. So to give 1 example of a filename and path would be 8 lines long...which would be dumb.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383745/remove-space-between-objects-when-using-write-host","title":"Remove space between objects when using Write-Host"},{"tags":["arrays","algorithm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53404,"user_id":90308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b7aefbc459629eb4c864b825894c9c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"FogleBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/90308/foglebird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571086307,"post_id":58383741,"comment_id":103115874,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383741/looking-for-a-array-reducing-algorithm#comment103115874_58383741"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":6933391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TXfdn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"he4d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6933391/he4d"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53404,"user_id":90308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7b7aefbc459629eb4c864b825894c9c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"FogleBird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/90308/foglebird"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571087202,"post_id":58383741,"comment_id":103116194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383741/looking-for-a-array-reducing-algorithm#comment103116194_58383741"},{"owner":{"reputation":2231,"user_id":2928853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dbIon.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jrook","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2928853/jrook"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571089921,"post_id":58383741,"comment_id":103116985,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383741/looking-for-a-array-reducing-algorithm#comment103116985_58383741"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":141603,"user_id":572670,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5011cf6d98e276b1bdc2cb321546e528?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"amit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/572670/amit"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571088290,"creation_date":1571088290,"answer_id":58384243,"question_id":58383741,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384243","body_markdown":"You could use **[interpolation][1]** to estimate a function that is similar to yours, and then you could just choose the desired points in the data range and estimate their value.

I have the following configuration in my Python3 run file:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;script&quot;: [\r\n        &quot;if [ \\&quot;$debug\\&quot; == true ]; then &quot;,\r\n        &quot;    docker run --rm --expose 15471 -p 15471:15471 -v /home/ubuntu/environment/:/project_directory little-test:latest sh -c \\&quot;python3 -m ikp3db -ik_p=15471 test.py \\&quot;&quot;,\r\n        //original&quot;    python3 -m ikp3db -ik_p=15471 -ik_cwd=$project_path \\&quot;$file\\&quot; $args&quot;,\r\n        &quot;else&quot;,\r\n        &quot;    docker run --rm -v /home/ubuntu/environment/:/project_directory little-test:latest sh -c \\&quot;python3 test.py\\&quot;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;fi&quot;,\r\n        &quot;checkExitCode() {&quot;,\r\n        &quot;    if [ $1 ] &amp;&amp; [ \\&quot;$debug\\&quot; == true ]; then &quot;,\r\n        &quot;        python3 -m ikp3db 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep -q &#39;No module&#39; &amp;&amp; echo &#39;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;    To use python debugger install ikpdb by running: &quot;,\r\n        &quot;        sudo yum update;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;        sudo yum install python36-devel;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;        sudo pip-3.6 install ikp3db;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;        &#39;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;    fi&quot;,\r\n        &quot;   return $1&quot;,\r\n        &quot;}&quot;,\r\n        &quot;checkExitCode $?&quot;\r\n      ],\r\n      &quot;python_version&quot;: &quot;python3&quot;,\r\n      &quot;working_dir&quot;: &quot;$project_path&quot;,\r\n      &quot;debugport&quot;: 15471,\r\n      &quot;$debugDefaultState&quot;: false,\r\n      &quot;debugger&quot;: &quot;ikpdb&quot;,\r\n      &quot;selector&quot;: &quot;^.*\\\\.(py)$&quot;,\r\n      &quot;env&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;PYTHONPATH&quot;: &quot;$python_path&quot;\r\n      },\r\n      &quot;trackId&quot;: &quot;Python3&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHowever run running a script with this I get a red pop up at the top of the Cloud9 IDE that says: `Could not connect debugger to the debugger proxy`. I thought maybe I got some of the port configuration wrong so I checked `sudo lsof -i -P -n` for both the original and the modified relevant bits are :\r\n\r\noriginal\r\n\r\n    python3   19833          ubuntu    3u  IPv4 201049      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:15471 (LISTEN)\r\n    python3   19833          ubuntu    4u  IPv4 201050      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:15471-&gt;127.0.0.1:33800 (ESTABLISHED)\r\n\r\nmodified\r\n\r\n    docker-pr 7805            root    4u  IPv4 154992      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.1:15471 (LISTEN)\r\n\r\nThe only difference seems to be the user it belongs to.

You shouldn&#39;t hardcode paths because regardless of which direction of slash you use, it can break on other operating systems.\r\n\r\nIt should work with something like this:\r\n```python3\r\nimport os\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\npicture_path = os.path.join(&quot;C:&quot;, &quot;Users&quot;, &quot;myusername&quot;, &quot;Downloads&quot;, &quot;Mathe&quot;, &quot;Picture.png&quot;)\r\nim = plt.imread(picture_path)\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383714/no-such-file-or-directory-with-absolute-path/58383811#58383811","title":"&#39;No such file or directory&#39; with absolute Path"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":8873120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aKiJBFwjoTY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/1__Fbv4RBMc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"RMPR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8873120/rmpr"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25425,"user_id":205580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/460e6e299e385fd46df156c85a1dd55f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eryk Sun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205580/eryk-sun"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571166718,"post_id":58383966,"comment_id":103147624,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383714/no-such-file-or-directory-with-absolute-path/58383966#comment103147624_58383966"},{"owner":{"reputation":25425,"user_id":205580,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/460e6e299e385fd46df156c85a1dd55f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Eryk Sun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205580/eryk-sun"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571167999,"post_id":58383966,"comment_id":103148130,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58383714/no-such-file-or-directory-with-absolute-path/58383966#comment103148130_58383966"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":142,"user_id":8873120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aKiJBFwjoTY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/1__Fbv4RBMc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"RMPR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8873120/rmpr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":142,"user_id":8873120,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aKiJBFwjoTY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/1__Fbv4RBMc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"RMPR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8873120/rmpr"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571843381,"last_edit_date":1571843381,"creation_date":1571086670,"answer_id":58383966,"question_id":58383714,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58383966","body_markdown":"As stated by the previous answer, you shouldn&#39;t hard-code paths and in general, to access the home directory of the current user, you can use\r\n    `os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&quot;)`\r\nand with some input control, your program becomes:\r\n```\r\nimport os\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n\r\npicture_path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&quot;), &quot;Downloads&quot;, &quot;Mathe&quot;,\r\n                            &quot;Picture.png&quot;)\r\nif os.path.isfile(picture_path):\r\n    im = plt.imread(picture_path)\r\n```\r\nYou can check the full documentation of os.path [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html).\r\n\r\nAs Eryk Sun noted in the comments, while in this case it works, In Windows, it&#39;s actually not advised to use `os.path.expanduser(&quot;~&quot;)` (i.e. the user&#39;s profile directory in most cases) because most of the special paths (i.e. known folders) are relocatable in the shell. Use the API to query the Windows shell for the path of a known folder (e.g. FOLDERID_Downloads).
