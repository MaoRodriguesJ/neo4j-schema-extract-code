The loading graphic just hangs and the component doesn&#39;t initialize after the route is found.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a solution to this problem?

Is this the right way to handle typing?  \r\n\r\nHere is an example I have tried and worked \r\n```typescript\r\nexport const getHealth = (): Promise&lt;\r\n  AxiosResponse&lt;IApiResonseData&lt;Health&gt;&gt;\r\n&gt; =&gt; axios.get(&quot;/HealthStatus&quot;);\r\n\r\nexport interface AxiosResponse&lt;T = any&gt;  {\r\n  data: T;\r\n  status: number;\r\n  statusText: string;\r\n  headers: any;\r\n  config: AxiosRequestConfig;\r\n  request?: any;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IApiResonseData&lt;T = any&gt; {\r\n  result: T;\r\n  status: IApiGenericStatus;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface IApiGenericStatus {\r\n  code: number;\r\n  description: string;\r\n  text: &quot;SUCCESS&quot;;\r\n  severity: &quot;NORMAL&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\ninterface Health{\r\n// whatever types it has \r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs this the right way to handle this kind of generic types nesting?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489029/how-to-correctly-handle-nested-generic-types-in-typescript","title":"How to correctly handle nested generic types in Typescript"},{"tags":["python","arrays","list","replace"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14352,"user_id":6881240,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc1e27d7e9a3de2ca8e257cb7c72ff4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kabanus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6881240/kabanus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14352,"user_id":6881240,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc1e27d7e9a3de2ca8e257cb7c72ff4a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kabanus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6881240/kabanus"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571670603,"last_edit_date":1571670603,"creation_date":1571670277,"answer_id":58489101,"question_id":58489024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489101","body_markdown":"One way:\r\n\r\n    deleted = 0\r\n    for start, end, replacement in b:\r\n        a[start - deleted:end + 1 - deleted] = replacement\r\n        deleted += (end + 1 - start) - len(replacement)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489024/how-do-i-make-multiple-multi-item-substitution-based-on-index-in-python-lists/58489101#58489101","title":"How do I make multiple multi-item substitution based on index in python lists?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11591565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ooqK0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"oekshido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11591565/oekshido"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571670603,"creation_date":1571670017,"question_id":58489024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489024","body_markdown":"Suppose I have a python list which looks like this:\r\n```python\r\na = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\r\n```\r\nAnd a list of tuples with replacing instructions in the format (starting index, ending index, elements to replace with)\r\n```python\r\nb = [ (2,5,[&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;])  , (8,8,[&quot;z&quot;]) ]\r\n```\r\nHow do I make the substitution without messing with the indices?

For some reason, the quantity of items stays at zero even though I added a ++. anyone help me with this?\r\n\r\nI have tried converting the integer to a string and back, but it does not seem to do anything.\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Pirate Trading Post v3&quot;);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;----------------------&quot;);\r\n        int eight = 8;\r\n        int hat = 32;\r\n        int patch = 2;\r\n        int sword = 20;\r\n        int map = 100;\r\n        int shirt = 150;\r\n        int test = -1;\r\n        int quanEight = 0;\r\n        int quanHat = 0;\r\n        int quanPatch = 0;\r\n        int quanSword = 0;\r\n        int quanMap = 0;\r\n        int quanShirt = 0;\r\n        int total = ( quanEight * eight) + ( quanHat * hat) + ( quanPatch * patch) + ( quanSword * sword) + ( quanShirt * shirt) + ( quanMap * map);\r\n        while (test != 0){\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Enter Item Code, ? or Q: &quot;);\r\n            String code = input.next();\r\n            char ch = code.charAt(0);\r\n            ch = Character.toUpperCase(ch);\r\n\r\n            if (ch == &#39;?&#39;){\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Valid Item codes are: 8 I H M S T.&quot;);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Q to quit.&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;Q&#39;){\r\n                test++;\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Pirate Trading Post&quot;);\r\n                System.out.println(quanEight + &quot; Genuine Piece Of Eight &quot; + quanHat + &quot; Pirate Hat &quot; + quanPatch + &quot; Eye Patch &quot; + quanSword + &quot; Sword &quot; + quanMap + &quot; Treasure Map &quot; + quanShirt + &quot; T-Shirt &quot;);\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Total: &quot; + total + &quot; bits&quot;);\r\n\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;8&#39;){\r\n                quanEight ++;\r\n\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;I&#39;){\r\n                quanHat++;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;H&#39;){\r\n                quanPatch++;\r\n            }    \r\n            else if (ch == &#39;M&#39;){\r\n                quanSword++;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;S&#39;){\r\n                quanMap++;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (ch == &#39;T&#39;){\r\n                quanShirt++;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe expected output should be cost of item multiplied by quantity, but the quantity will not store the value. I am thinking the value is not stored because it is a string, but I am not sure.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489018/trying-to-figure-out-why-my-math-will-not-add","title":"Trying to figure out why my math will not add"},{"tags":["c++","linked-list","singly-linked-list"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571670200,"post_id":58489016,"comment_id":103308479,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp#comment103308479_58489016"},{"owner":{"reputation":8104,"user_id":6752050,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d5c4caa7ff50e6e492c3957ca20ef6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S.M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6752050/s-m"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571670323,"post_id":58489016,"comment_id":103308544,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp#comment103308544_58489016"},{"owner":{"reputation":5074,"user_id":4645334,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hoIJVId9WIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGQw/r7Es0WqE4rs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thomas Sablik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4645334/thomas-sablik"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571671984,"post_id":58489016,"comment_id":103309459,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp#comment103309459_58489016"},{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11503939,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GRgRkaBTCXk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdNQpaBzBJXuZuMW9hBtLUqLkgtXA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nikhil Bhutani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11503939/nikhil-bhutani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672601,"post_id":58489016,"comment_id":103309798,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp#comment103309798_58489016"},{"owner":{"reputation":45707,"user_id":225074,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dea26ac1ef8259140d28aa8b5ba4f1b3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas Matthews","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/225074/thomas-matthews"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571673863,"post_id":58489016,"comment_id":103310450,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp#comment103310450_58489016"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":11503939,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GRgRkaBTCXk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdNQpaBzBJXuZuMW9hBtLUqLkgtXA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nikhil Bhutani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11503939/nikhil-bhutani"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571827692,"post_id":58489842,"comment_id":103367514,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489016/the-question-is-regarding-singly-list-in-c-and-its-operations-create-and-disp/58489842#comment103367514_58489842"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5074,"user_id":4645334,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hoIJVId9WIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGQw/r7Es0WqE4rs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thomas Sablik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4645334/thomas-sablik"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5074,"user_id":4645334,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hoIJVId9WIY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGQw/r7Es0WqE4rs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Thomas Sablik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4645334/thomas-sablik"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571673324,"last_edit_date":1571673324,"creation_date":1571672949,"answer_id":58489842,"question_id":58489016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489842","body_markdown":"This should fix most of the problems in your code\r\n\r\n- You are allocating memory but you don&#39;t delete it.

However if the python code in my tasks raises an exception, I cannot see it logged anywhere. If I manually insert an error, for example an illegal import that will raise an exception, then I can see this in log (3) when I manually run the task on the command line. If however the systemd service initiates this exception, it cannot be seen in log (3). Even if I make the forced error task run every minute for example, I can see it being dispatched correctly in log (2), received in log (1), then my code logging to log (3) until it hits the exception whereupon the logging in log (3) doesn&#39;t record this.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know where this python exception will be logged? And also, if there is any log on my system that shows that the task failed and why?\r\n\r\nMany thanks, LJHW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489011/where-are-systemd-controlled-celery-task-failures-and-python-excpetions-logged","title":"Where are systemd controlled Celery Task failures and Python excpetions logged?"},{"tags":["python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":885,"user_id":10852841,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe7a38cc20a4dc6159ee347bf6c19fdf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HS-nebula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10852841/hs-nebula"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571670041,"post_id":58489007,"comment_id":103308390,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489007/how-to-add-salt-and-pepper-noise-to-all-images-in-a-folder-in-python#comment103308390_58489007"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252256,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47019e4ab8c36d0708ee7efc9f544488?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amit Sen ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252256/amit-sen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571769925,"post_id":58489376,"comment_id":103348660,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489007/how-to-add-salt-and-pepper-noise-to-all-images-in-a-folder-in-python/58489376#comment103348660_58489376"},{"owner":{"reputation":184,"user_id":3416340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLR5T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ghost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3416340/ghost"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252256,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47019e4ab8c36d0708ee7efc9f544488?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amit Sen ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252256/amit-sen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571791380,"post_id":58489376,"comment_id":103355080,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489007/how-to-add-salt-and-pepper-noise-to-all-images-in-a-folder-in-python/58489376#comment103355080_58489376"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":184,"user_id":3416340,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HLR5T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ghost","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3416340/ghost"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571671222,"creation_date":1571671222,"answer_id":58489376,"question_id":58489007,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489376","body_markdown":"While looping through the directory, you need to load each image, add salt and pepper noise and save it back.\r\n\r\n 1.

&quot;Cannot resolve IP/port for the connection&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n            exit(0);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen I connect like this\r\n\r\n    asio::error_code errCode;\r\n    asio::connect(_socket, _endPoints, errCode);\r\n    if (!errCode)\r\n    {\r\n            launch_thread();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe thread itself is a loop in which bytes are read using `_socket.read_some()` then moved to a mutex-protected array, or moved from another mutex-protected array then sent using `_socket.write_some()`\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**What happens when I put the two codes together:**\r\n\r\nThe serial-port device is currently unplugged, I&#39;m expecting `nbAvailable` to be 0 every time I check how many bytes are available from the serial port, but it isn&#39;t the case and many bytes are received when they should not be.\r\n\r\nTo the best I can tell, this seems to be the result of `asio` doing things to the serial I&#39;m using. It&#39;s not that far-fetched, since `asio` also features serial-port i/o facilities in addition to their TCP/IP facilities, and all the evidence points to it:\r\n\r\n- the problems only arise when the TCP/IP communication starts\r\n- commenting the _socket.write_some() calls removes the issue\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**What I want to know:**\r\n\r\nWhy is `asio` interfering with my serial port communication, when I&#39;m only using its TCP/IP facilities?

And to abort the reduction and return the failed `LeftT[Future, L, Seq[R]]` otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have a successful reduction for the happy path with the following code: \r\n\r\n    type Producer = () =&gt; EitherT[Future, L, Seq[R]] // where L and R are known types.\r\n    private def execute(producers:Seq[Producer]):EitherT[Future, L, Seq[R]] = {\r\n      producers match {\r\n        case last :: Nil =&gt;\r\n          last()\r\n        case current :: nexts =&gt;\r\n          current().flatMap(res =&gt; execute(nexts).map(res ++ _))\r\n       } \r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut I cannot find a clean way to handle a `LefT`. Do you have any tips on how to handle the left case on my reduction ?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n**Edit**: because it may not be clear enough.\r\n\r\nMy input is a `Seq[Producer]` (A `Producer` give an `EitherT` when it is applied). I want to apply and reduce my producers to one `EitherT` but I have to abort the process if one producer fail (returns one `EitherT` which hold a `Left`).\r\n\r\nGiven :\r\n \r\n+ `P1`, `P2` and `P3`, three producers that returns a `Right` `EitherT`, respectively `Seq(A)`, `Seq(B)` and `Seq(C, D)`\r\n+ Reduction of `Seq(P1, P2, P3)` will return an `EitherT` of a `Right(Seq(A, B, C, D))`.\r\n\r\nGiven:\r\n\r\n+ `P1` and `P3`, two producers that returns a `Right` `EitherT`, respectively `Seq(A)` and `Seq(C, D)`\r\n+ `P2` one producer returning a `Left(&quot;fail&quot;)\r\n\r\n+ Reduction of `Seq(P1, P2, P3)` will return an `EitherT` of a `Left(&quot;fail&quot;)`.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488987/cats-reducing-a-seq-of-eithert","title":"Cats, reducing a Seq of EitherT"},{"tags":["visual-studio","debugging","remote-debugging","visual-studio-2019"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571776095,"post_id":58499336,"comment_id":103351151,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488986/how-can-i-connect-to-a-server-using-the-visual-studio-remote-debugger/58499336#comment103351151_58499336"},{"owner":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571776287,"post_id":58499336,"comment_id":103351221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488986/how-can-i-connect-to-a-server-using-the-visual-studio-remote-debugger/58499336#comment103351221_58499336"},{"owner":{"reputation":4900,"user_id":10910450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zd6y5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lance Li-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10910450/lance-li-msft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571793821,"post_id":58499336,"comment_id":103355530,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488986/how-can-i-connect-to-a-server-using-the-visual-studio-remote-debugger/58499336#comment103355530_58499336"},{"owner":{"reputation":4900,"user_id":10910450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zd6y5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lance Li-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10910450/lance-li-msft"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571795348,"post_id":58499336,"comment_id":103355819,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488986/how-can-i-connect-to-a-server-using-the-visual-studio-remote-debugger/58499336#comment103355819_58499336"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4900,"user_id":10910450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zd6y5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lance Li-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10910450/lance-li-msft"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4900,"user_id":10910450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zd6y5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lance Li-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10910450/lance-li-msft"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571795103,"last_edit_date":1571795103,"creation_date":1571730241,"answer_id":58499336,"question_id":58488986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58499336","body_markdown":"&gt; Does the server need to be on the same LAN or something? How can I\r\n&gt; connect to this remote server?\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s recommended to debug between two computers that are connected over a network, workgroup, or homegroup, or else connected directly through an Ethernet cable. And not recommended to connect over Internet though it&#39;s possible.(See [Remote debug over Internet with VS](https://keyoti.com/blog/remote-debug-net-applications-over-the-internet-with-visual-studio/))\r\n\r\n&gt; when I enter the URL of the server into the &quot;connection target&quot; in the\r\n&gt; attach to process dialog and click &quot;find...&quot; then the server is not\r\n&gt; found.\r\n\r\nFor me, I encounter similar issues when the local and remote machines are not in same domain. Here&#39;s some tips which may help:\r\n\r\n1.Make sure the remote debugger in your remote machine has started. (waiting for new connection status...)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n2.To avoid any connection issue, I suggest you can test if your local machine(VS installed) can connect to the remote machine by `Remote Desktop Connection` before attaching to process.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n3.After #1 and #2, now go to `Attach to process` dialog. I suggest you type the `IPV4 address` in `Connection Target`. I tried `Machine name` several times but no luck, it only works when I use the `IPV4 address` of my remote machine. (The IPV4 address is the address we use to connect remote desktop in #2)\r\n\r\nFor me, I type IPV4 address(xx.xx.xx.xx) in the `Connection Target`, and then press **Enter**. The processes running in remote machine will then display. (Press **Enter** instead of clicking the **Find** button, and sometimes you may need to add the port, so you can also try `xx.xx.xx.xx:4024`)\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nI suggest we test the connection(local machine and remote machine) in #2 before attach to process in #3, normally we type the IP address like this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nConnect to remote machine and then start the debugger there(#1), now in #3, type the same IP address(11.1xx.1xx.1x) into the connection target. press **Enter** to pass the Windows Security popup.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nTwo possible reasons why you can&#39;t connect to the remote debugger:\r\n\r\n1. You can&#39;t connect to the remote machine even by remote desktop connection in #2.\r\n\r\n2. Your local PC(windows) can connect to remote machine(windows 2012 or...), but you forget to [start the debugger](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/remote-debugging-aspnet-on-a-remote-iis-7-5-computer?view=vs-2019#BKMK_setup) in remote machine. Make sure you have a window like #1 in your remote machine. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tUpIN.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/JRUDz.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/cpaor.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/96GkK.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488986/how-can-i-connect-to-a-server-using-the-visual-studio-remote-debugger/58499336#58499336","title":"How can I connect to a server using the Visual Studio remote debugger?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2003,"user_id":1159763,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0622d669c6102714da374348a24df617?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ekolis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1159763/ekolis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571795103,"creation_date":1571669894,"question_id":58488986,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488986","body_markdown":"I&#39;m following [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/remote-debugging-aspnet-on-a-remote-iis-7-5-computer?view=vs-2019#BKMK_msvsmon) and I have the Visual Studio remote debugger app running on the target server, but I can&#39;t connect to it from Visual Studio - when I enter the URL of the server into the &quot;connection target&quot; in the attach to process dialog and click &quot;find...&quot; then the server is not found.

If you just run `Import-Csv -Path &quot;C:\\temp\\departmentlist.csv&quot; -Header department`, you&#39;ll see the issue.\r\n\r\nThe next problem is  that in props1 and props2, you both `gm` and `select -expand Name` which doesn&#39;t actually exist in any of the columns you&#39;ve provided. Change that to `select -expand &quot;Display Name&quot;`, if that is your intention, and get rid of the gm command. \r\n\r\nNext, you need to loop through each item in your CSV files, so add a foreach in there - foreach item in the newemp folder, perform the following commands.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d also recommend not using &quot;throw&quot; as it actually throws an error and can be difficult to read if there are too many. If this was an app where you want to throw real errors, then that would be fine but for readability, I recommend doing a `write-host` instead. \r\n\r\nIn the script below I assume that WindowsEmailAddress is the unique identifier for the user.

I&#39;ll try to explain:\r\n\r\n    class AlreadyDefined // begin class scope\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args){ // begin method scope\r\n       \r\n            for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){ // begin loop scope. \r\n                /// This scope also includes variables from method scope\r\n                int y = i; \r\n                System.out.println(i);\r\n            } // end loop scope\r\n\r\n        } // end method scope\r\n\r\n    } // end class scope\r\n\r\nI labeled the respective scopes in the above code and where they begin and end.\r\n\r\nIn the above example, once the `for` loop ends, `int y` goes out of scope and can no longer be referenced. So after `end loop scope`, `System.out.println(y)` will fail, as `y` no longer exists. \r\n\r\nIn the second example, `y` already exists in method scope. You cannot redefine a variable with the same name in a &quot;child&quot; scope, which is why your second example fails. \r\n\r\nThere is one exception to this, however. You may define a variable with an identical name to one defined in class scope. So this would work:\r\n\r\n    class AlreadyDefined // begin class scope\r\n    {\r\n        static int y = 0; // Defining variable with identical name.\r\n\r\n        public static void main(String[] args){ // begin method scope\r\n       \r\n            for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++){ // begin loop scope\r\n                int y = i; // This still works\r\n                System.out.println(i);\r\n            } // end loop scope\r\n\r\n        } // end method scope\r\n\r\n    } // end class scope\r\n\r\nFor class scope, if there is an identically named variable in method scope, you must qualify it with `this`. So to reference the class scoped `y` variable inside `main`, you would use `this.y`. This is why you will commonly see variables assigned in constructors and setters like this:\r\n\r\n    public class SomeClass {\r\n        int property\r\n\r\n        public SomeClass(int property) {\r\n            this.property = property;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void setProperty(int property) {\r\n            this.property = property;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnother example: \r\n\r\n        public void setProperty(int property) {\r\n           property = property;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIf you were to do this, this would have no effect, as you did not specify `this.property`. You&#39;d simply be setting the value of property to itself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488964/why-does-this-java-code-not-give-an-is-already-defined-error/58489750#58489750","title":"Why does this java code not give an &quot;is already defined &quot; error?"}],"owner":{"reputation":100,"user_id":1971062,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5bd40135f624b421e54000eb9a5c0f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Douma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1971062/douma"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58489750,"answer_count":3,"score":-3,"last_activity_date":1571672596,"creation_date":1571669786,"question_id":58488964,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488964","body_markdown":"Why does this java code not give an already defined error for y?\r\nI can understand why, because it is in a loop.

You just need to build the final predicate depending on the conditions required.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488955/how-to-filter-a-list-of-object-by-multiple-fields-in-java/58489120#58489120","title":"How to filter a list of object by multiple fields in Java?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":568,"user_id":11869748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qh4YQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZektorH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869748/zektorh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571670436,"creation_date":1571670436,"answer_id":58489156,"question_id":58488955,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489156","body_markdown":"You probably want to use the `filter` function.

That is, because I do not want to copy and paste the same lines of code 35 times with some little edits.\r\n\r\nTo achieve this, I set up a for-loop that creates 35 different plots (by using data from a different variable each loop-cycle). The resulting plots are then stored in a list that already has the length of 35. Now, when I look at the different elements of said list, it shows the exact same plot in all elements of the list i tried so far. I know for sure, e.g., that in spot no. 1 of the list, there should be a different plot than there currently is.\r\n\r\nI already creates some individual plots, e.g. like this:\r\n\r\n    p1 &lt;- ggplot(predval, aes(x = theta, y = predval[,2])) +\r\n        geom_line() +\r\n        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) +\r\n        theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\r\n              axis.title.y = element_blank(),\r\n              legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +\r\n        scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\r\n\r\n(Note: I use column 2 of my dataset &quot;predval&quot; to plot the y-axis, because column one contains the &quot;theta&quot;-variable used for the x-axis. That is why I use column 2 for plot no. 1.)\r\n\r\nThis work just fine. To save myself from doing this 35 times, I tried to create a loop (see below).  However, when I run the loop, the list is filled with 35 copies of the same plot. Why does it do that and how can I fix it?\r\n\r\n    plotlist[[1]] &lt;- NA           # to create the plotlist\r\n    for (i in 1:35){\r\n      plotlist[[i]] &lt;- NA           # give it length 35\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (i in 1:35){              # 35 cycles for 35 plots\r\n      plotlist[[i]] &lt;- ggplot(predval, aes(x = theta, y = predval[,i+1])) +\r\n                         geom_line() +\r\n                         coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) +\r\n                         theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\r\n                               axis.title.y = element_blank(),\r\n                               legend.position = &quot;none&quot;) +\r\n                         scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI expect to receive a list full of different ggplots I can use for ggarrange&#39;s &quot;plotlist&quot;-argument.\r\n\r\n######## EDIT ########\r\nqdread&#39;s advice worked perfectly well for me!

is basic concurrency and as always, you need to have a specific strategy for handling concurrency. The method you&#39;re currently using is insufficient unless you gate the logic, such that only one request can go through the pipeline at a time, using a semaphore. That skirts the issue of concurrency, but obviously has an impact on performance, as you&#39;re creating a choke point in your application.\r\n\r\nYour best bet here, since you have the unique constraint, is to wrap the code in a try/catch and actually handle the scenario you&#39;re facing.

don&#39;t know much about asteroidOS. But this would be the approach I would take. Train a ML/DL model based on the Accelerometer and gyroscope values or analyse the both signals and find a condition which indicates the fall.\r\n\r\nHere is a great paper you check: https://storm.cis.fordham.edu/~gweiss/papers/bhi-ar-2016.pdf  \r\n\r\nAccelerometers in mobile phones are used to detect the orientation of the phone. The gyroscope, or gyro for short, adds an additional dimension to the information supplied by the accelerometer by tracking rotation or twist.\r\n\r\nAn accelerometer measures linear acceleration of movement, while a gyro on the other hand measures the angular rotational velocity. Both sensors measure rate of change; they just measure the rate of change for different things.\r\n\r\nIn practice, that means that an accelerometer will measure the directional movement of a device but will not be able to resolve its lateral orientation or tilt during that movement accurately unless a gyro is there to fill in that info.\r\n\r\nAccelerometers are also used to provide &#39;steps&#39; information for a &#39;health&#39; application. Probably you can get some inspiration by researching this domain.\r\n\r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488919/how-do-i-detect-falling-people-with-a-smart-watch/58489165#58489165","title":"How do I detect falling people with a smart watch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":8335993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/739b972f7f4807df7f088125daeca3cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bekir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8335993/bekir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":8335993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/739b972f7f4807df7f088125daeca3cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bekir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8335993/bekir"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":3,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571670466,"creation_date":1571669620,"last_edit_date":1571670142,"question_id":58488919,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488919","body_markdown":"I am a senior in computer engineering and I have a question for you.

current user`\r\n\r\nObtaining information about the current user\r\nInside the SecurityContextHolder we store details of the principal currently interacting with the application. Spring Security uses an Authentication object to represent this information. You won’t normally need to create an Authentication object yourself, but it is fairly common for users to query the Authentication object. You can use the following code block - from anywhere in your application - to obtain the name of the currently authenticated user, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nObject principal = SecurityContextHolder.getContext().getAuthentication().getPrincipal();\r\n\r\nif (principal instanceof UserDetails) {\r\nString username = ((UserDetails)principal).getUsername();\r\n} else {\r\nString username = principal.toString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe object returned by the call to getContext() is an instance of the SecurityContext interface. This is the object that is kept in thread-local storage. As we’ll see below, most authentication mechanisms within Spring Security return an instance of UserDetails as the principal.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488899/how-to-get-id-current-logged-in-spring/58489929#58489929","title":"How to get id current-logged in Spring"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10358410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qBDJUx5Hg_A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/APUIFaM4_ZPy4bhb87lHs8Cx6M9fn-qmDg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Семен Немытов","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10358410/%d0%a1%d0%b5%d0%bc%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d0%9d%d0%b5%d0%bc%d1%8b%d1%82%d0%be%d0%b2"},"last_editor":{"reputation":136,"user_id":6112907,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/108b126b1479b9d92dc6520d1a5ebcd5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jagadesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6112907/jagadesh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571673256,"creation_date":1571669560,"last_edit_date":1571671543,"question_id":58488899,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488899","body_markdown":"I have User class with id, username, and password.

type in C++ falls into exactly one of the following categories, possibly cv-qualified:\r\n\r\n * `void`\r\n * `decltype(nullptr)` (a.k.a. `std::nullptr_t`)\r\n * Arithmetic\r\n * Array\r\n * Pointer

So the result type for `__libcpp_is_function_imp::__test&lt;_Tp&gt;(_Tp&amp;)` should be `_two`. And `sizeof(_two)` should equal to 2, which is different from `1`. In other words, the equation `sizeof(__libcpp_is_function_imp::__test&lt;_Tp&gt;(__libcpp_is_function_imp::__source&lt;_Tp&gt;(0))) == 1` is always false.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut I must get something wrong.

I want to make maximum use of the typings available.\r\n\r\nMost of the time the typings and type inference just works fine.\r\n\r\nIn some pieces of code I would like to pass a reference to a specific component type. i.e.\r\n```typescript\r\nconst MyComponent = Vue.extend({...});\r\n\r\nfunction myFunction(someComponent: MyComponent) {\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis unfortunately results in the error:\r\n\r\n```&#39;MyComponent&#39; refers to a value, but is being used as a type here.```\r\n\r\nSomething that works is this, where I create an instance and then use typeof of that instance in the function declaration:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst MyComponent = Vue.extend({...});\r\n\r\nlet myComponentInstance = new MyComponent();\r\nfunction myFunction(someComponent: typeof myComponentInstance ) {\r\n    ...\r\n    someComponent.someProperty;\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this without having to create an instance of `MyComponent`? To me it feels like is should be possible as the knowledge is there.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nWith the suggestion of @Bill-Naylor I got it down to this.\r\n```typescript\r\nconst MyComponent =  Vue.extend({\r\n    data() {\r\n        return {\r\n            test: &quot;test&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nlet dummy = () =&gt; new MyComponent();\r\nexport type MyComponentInstance = ReturnType&lt;typeof dummy&gt;\r\n\r\nlet test : MyComponentInstance;\r\nlet str = test.test;\r\n```\r\nIs it possible to get it down even more without the dummy function?\r\n\r\nEdit2:\r\n\r\nIt is possible with `InstanceType&lt;...&gt;`.\r\n\r\nThis works:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst MyComponent =  Vue.extend({\r\n    data() {\r\n        return {\r\n            test: &quot;test&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport type MyComponentInstance = InstanceType&lt;typeof MyComponent&gt;\r\n\r\nlet test : MyComponentInstance;\r\nlet str = test.test;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488865/is-there-a-way-to-get-the-type-of-a-component-in-vuejs","title":"Is there a way to get the type of a component in vuejs?"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core","swagger","swashbuckle"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6298,"user_id":215042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9814828bd8d94a47c12461f364baaa82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RobIII","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215042/robiii"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672404,"post_id":58489384,"comment_id":103309691,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488864/change-property-type-as-exported-by-swagger-swashbuckle/58489384#comment103309691_58489384"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2490,"user_id":4720542,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4e0bc72398f665ad698f7680f636540d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"strickt01","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720542/strickt01"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571671258,"creation_date":1571671258,"answer_id":58489384,"question_id":58488864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489384","body_markdown":"As you are converting to a non-complex type you should be able to use `MapType` for this IPAddress example:\r\n\r\n    swagger.MapType&lt;IPAddress&gt;(() =&gt; new Schema { Type = &quot;string&quot; });\r\n\r\nIf you are converting to a complex type then you&#39;d need to use [SchemaFilter][1].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58488864/change-property-type-as-exported-by-swagger-swashbuckle/58489384#58489384","title":"Change property type as exported by Swagger/Swashbuckle"}],"owner":{"reputation":6298,"user_id":215042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9814828bd8d94a47c12461f364baaa82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RobIII","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215042/robiii"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6298,"user_id":215042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9814828bd8d94a47c12461f364baaa82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RobIII","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215042/robiii"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58489384,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571672731,"creation_date":1571669456,"last_edit_date":1571672731,"question_id":58488864,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58488864","body_markdown":"I have a fairly complex object with nested objects; please note that in the example below I have simplified this object greatly.\r\n\r\nAssume the following example object:\r\n\r\n    public class Result {\r\n        public string Name { get; set; }\r\n        public IpAddress IpAddress { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have implemented a `JsonConverter&lt;IPAddress&gt;` than (de)serializes the Ip as a string:\r\n\r\n    public class IPAddressConverter : JsonConverter&lt;IPAddress&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        public override IPAddress Read(ref Utf8JsonReader reader, Type typeToConvert, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n            =&gt; IPAddress.Parse(reader.GetString());\r\n\r\n        public override void Write(Utf8JsonWriter writer, IPAddress value, JsonSerializerOptions options)\r\n            =&gt; writer.WriteStringValue(value.ToString());\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `IPAddressConverter` was then &#39;registered&#39; as a converter in the `AddJsonOptions(...)` method.

visualized:\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI was hoping to be able to add an annotation / attribute on some properties (so I looked at [Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/tree/master/src/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore.Annotations)) but that doesn&#39;t seem to be possible.\r\n\r\nAlso, because the object is fairly complex and comes from a 3rd party library it&#39;s hard for me to actually add annotations / attributes on properties because I can&#39;t change the model (easily).\r\n\r\nI _could_ resort to AutoMapper (or alike) to create another model with a string for IP adresses but that would mean having to model all objects in the original model. Besides, it requires extra code and maintenance when the model changes. I&#39;d rather tell Swashbuckle, somehow, that IP adresses (and, so, the type [`IPAddress`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.ipaddress) will be represented as a string (in- and outgoing to my API). I&#39;m looking for options on how to accomplish this the best way possible within given limitations (preferably not introducing new models to map to, preferably no annotations/attributes because I can&#39;t easily access the 3rd party library). Is there a way to register a &quot;type-converter-something&quot; for Swashbuckle to handle this?\r\n\r\n# Update: [Solved](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489384/215042)!\r\n\r\nThis is what I ended up with:\r\n\r\n\t// This method gets called by the runtime.

The controlling computer measures a **load of ~86%** (with minima of 68% and peaks of 100%).\r\n 2. A USB CAN bus analyser I connect to the network registers a traffic\r\n    of messages (count-wise) that is around *half* of what I nominally\r\n    expect (i.e., 4 sent, 4 received each cycle, for 50 seconds should result in 50k messages, while I only see 18-25k).

So the final output should look like this:\r\n```xml\r\n&lt;div&gt;\r\n  &lt;span class=&quot;column1&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;a id=&quot;l1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;aaaaa&lt;span type=&quot;foo&quot;&gt;aaa&lt;/span&gt;aa&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;br id=&quot;l2&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;aaaaaaa&lt;/span&gt;\r\n  &lt;/span&gt;\r\n  &lt;span class=&quot;column2&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;br id=&quot;l3&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro main&quot;&gt;aaabbbb&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;br id=&quot;l4&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;bb&lt;span&gt;123&lt;/span&gt;bbbbb&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;br id=&quot;l5&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;bbbbbbb&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    &lt;br id=&quot;l6&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;ccccccc&lt;/span&gt;\r\n  &lt;/span&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the xquery I have until now:\r\n```xquery\r\nfor $section in $sections/section\r\n    for $line in $s/@from to $s/@to\r\n        let $name := $section/@type\r\n        let $br := $text//*[contains(@id, concat(&#39;l&#39;, $line))]\r\n        let $newline := &lt;span class=&quot;{$name}&quot;&gt;{$text//*[contains(@id, concat(&#39;l&#39;, $line))]/following-sibling::node()[following-sibling::*[contains(@id, concat(&#39;l&#39;, $line+1))]]}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n    return\r\n        ($br, $newline)\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is not working!\r\n\r\n 1. I have problems where a line belongs to two sections. For instance I get both \r\n`&lt;br id=&quot;l3&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;` and `&lt;br id=&quot;l3&quot;/&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;main&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;`\r\n 2. if lines were grouped into `&lt;span&gt;` elements for columns (or other levels of grouping), this gets lost.\r\n\r\nI haven&#39;t got a clue how to get to the desired output.
