You have Read(2, 10), and we have read 14 bits, so the shift is easy it is 4 since you need to shift by 4 bits. The mask in binary is 0011 1111 1111 0000 so 0x3FF0. Naturally big endian and little endian can interfer here so you have to be careful that the data is in the right order. Notice that you can store the variables in an array for extra efficiency and change extraction() into a for loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101420/is-there-a-better-way-to-use-bitstreams-to-decode-a-file-format/58102360#58102360","title":"Is there a better way to use bitstreams to decode a file format?"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":1628858,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3e5c3f18141f74489327b5600cfa01ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Moon4u","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1628858/moon4u"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58102360,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569623953,"creation_date":1569423755,"question_id":58101420,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101420","body_markdown":"I am trying to make a program that decodes an mp3 file (as an exercise). The important part is not that it is an mp3 file, but the way that the file format is structured. The length (in bits) of some variables depends on previous variables. So, let&#39;s say that you read 2 bits for one variable and based on its value, you have to read either 10 bits or 20 bits for the next variable. What makes things worst is that every consecutive read is offset by the same length. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using the following [bitstream](https://sakhnik.com/2018/03/23/bitstream.html) implementation, which works wonderfully and I&#39;m really happy with the asm that&#39;s being generated. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that this implementation requires to know the offset and length for each bitread during compilation. The variable length of some of the variables makes it really hard to implement.\r\n\r\nThere are two ideas that come to mind and both of them seems bad. One would be to change the bit reading function so that I pass the offset as a parameter to the function as a regular argument instead of as a template argument. This is obviously awful because we lose the beautiful asm. The bigger point is that this information is already known. This shouldn&#39;t happen at runtime when the information is available at compile time. I just need to be able to explain it better to the compiler. \r\n\r\nThe other idea is to use some weird template metaprogramming (check the second coding example)\r\n\r\nThe first idea is as follows:\r\n```c++\r\n// the function works like the one in the bitstream implementation that I pointed earlier, but the offset is an argument to the function, instead of a template argument.\r\ntemplate&lt;unsigned count&gt;\r\nuint32_t Read(int offset, const uint8_t* src, uint32_t accum = 0);\r\n\r\nuint32_t var1 = Read(0, 2, data);\r\nswitch(var1) {\r\n  case 0b00: {\r\n    uint32_t var2 = Read(2, 10, data);\r\n    uint32_t var3 = Read(12, 3, data);\r\n    uint32_t var4 = Read(15, 1, data);\r\n    //... etc\r\n    break;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  case 0b01: {\r\n    uint32_t var2 = Read(2, 20, data);\r\n    uint32_t var3 = Read(22,  3, data);\r\n    uint32_t var4 = Read(25,  3, data);\r\n    // ... etc\r\n   break;\r\n  }\r\n  default: \r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second idea is to use the unmodified Read function but move all offsets &amp; lengths to a sperate template class, and have specializations for each case.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\ntemplate&lt;enum DIFFERENT_CASES T&gt; struct offsets_and_lengths {};\r\n\r\nstruct BitReads { unsigned offset; unsigned length; };\r\n\r\ntemplate&lt;&gt; struct offsets_and_lengths&lt;CASE_1&gt; {\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var2 = { 2, 10 };\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var3 = { 12, 3 };\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var4 = { 15, 1 };\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate&lt;&gt; struct offsets_and_lengths&lt;CASE_2&gt; {\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var2 = { 2, 20 };\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var3 = { 22, 3 };\r\n  static constexpr BitReads var4 = { 25, 1 };\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate&lt;enum DIFFERENT_CASES T&gt;\r\nvoid doDifferentReads(uint8_t* data) {\r\n  using offsets = offsets_and_legnths&lt;T&gt;;\r\n  uint32_t var2 = Read&lt;offsets::var2.offset, offsets.length&gt;(data);\r\n  uint32_t var3 = Read&lt;offsets::var3.offset, offsets.length&gt;(data);\r\n  uint32_t var4 = Read&lt;offsets::var4.offset, offsets.length&gt;(data);\r\n  // ... etc\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nuint32_t var1 = Read(0, 2, data);\r\nswitch(var1) {\r\n  case 0b00: {\r\n    doDifferentReads&lt;CASE_1&gt;(data);\r\n    break;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  case 0b01: {\r\n    doDifferentReads&lt;CASE_2&gt;(data);\r\n   break;\r\n  }\r\n  default: \r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem with the second implementation is that I may end up having another variable with a possible difference in its length. At that point, I&#39;ll have to create 4 different specializations. 8 for the next one... etc. \r\n\r\nSo I guess the big question is: Is there a sane way to do decoding on such formats if I want to use the static data that I know? So that the generate asm would be small.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101420/is-there-a-better-way-to-use-bitstreams-to-decode-a-file-format","title":"Is there a better way to use bitstreams to decode a file format?"},{"tags":["unity3d"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":187,"user_id":7020445,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15a6996380b0fc8ec04e1d2de0e56d7a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Milos Romanic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7020445/milos-romanic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423805,"post_id":58101418,"comment_id":102594393,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install#comment102594393_58101418"},{"owner":{"reputation":21209,"user_id":7111561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNnq7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"derHugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7111561/derhugo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569424275,"post_id":58101418,"comment_id":102594662,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install#comment102594662_58101418"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12018788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eb827cf7896e73dcc78530a67a01011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chromalight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018788/chromalight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425008,"post_id":58101418,"comment_id":102595094,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install#comment102595094_58101418"},{"owner":{"reputation":21209,"user_id":7111561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNnq7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"derHugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7111561/derhugo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425090,"post_id":58101418,"comment_id":102595145,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install#comment102595145_58101418"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12018788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eb827cf7896e73dcc78530a67a01011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chromalight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018788/chromalight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425161,"post_id":58101418,"comment_id":102595183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install#comment102595183_58101418"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12018788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eb827cf7896e73dcc78530a67a01011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chromalight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018788/chromalight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425370,"post_id":58101797,"comment_id":102595302,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install/58101797#comment102595302_58101797"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12018788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6eb827cf7896e73dcc78530a67a01011?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Chromalight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018788/chromalight"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569425615,"post_id":58101797,"comment_id":102595438,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101418/unity-3d-is-layout-errors-on-a-fresh-install/58101797#comment102595438_58101797"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21209,"user_id":7111561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNnq7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"derHugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7111561/derhugo"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569425049,"creation_date":1569425049,"answer_id":58101797,"question_id":58101418,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58101797","body_markdown":"[Unity 2020.1.0a3](https://unity3d.com/de/unity/alpha/2020.1.0a3) is an **ALPHA VERSION**!\r\n\r\nAs any alpha version it is **not stable for production** and can be expected to be full of bugs and unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nSearch through the `Known Issues in 2020.1.0a3` maybe your problem is already listed there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn general **do not touch** alpha or beta versions unless you want to checkout a new added feature and test it.\r\n\r\nFor anything else stick to the **stable** releases like [`2019.1.14f1`](https://unity3d.com/de/unity/whats-new/2019.1.14) or [2019.2.6f1](https://unity3d.com/de/unity/whats-new/2019.2.6)\r\n\r\nOn the last letter you can see their state: \r\n\r\n -

The character is supposed to slowly move/walk (not teleport) to the destination you set by right-clicking on the canvas. The problem is I used some math to determine the angle the character should be heading towards and also wrote a function that draws a circle directly on the destination (attempting to debug). The thing is, I click on a position, the destination circle is displayed in another position and the character is walking towards another 3d position.

you&#39;re confused about where to start, you can get some help from [issue #1394](https://github.com/github/VisualStudio/issues/1394).\r\n\r\nAlso in my opinion, to uninstall the extension you can try: \r\n\r\n1.Open `Developer command prompt for VS2019` and type `vsixinstaller /uninstall:c3d3dc68-c977-411f-b3e8-03b0dccf7dfc`.(Similar issue suggests us to install new version of the extension

Is there a way to simulate being client side and parse the HTML from there? \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vCN4g.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101381/fetch-gives-me-javascript-instead-of-html","title":"Fetch gives me javascript instead of HTML"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","r-markdown"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4904,"user_id":3087927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":14,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0eb1c6d3cb3f33fa2b60adcbacda549a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cory","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3087927/cory"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1569423824,"post_id":58101379,"comment_id":102594408,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101379/making-graphs-in-r-markdown#comment102594408_58101379"},{"owner":{"reputation":63981,"user_id":1422451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sFFvX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Parfait","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1422451/parfait"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1569424060,"post_id":58101379,"comment_id":102594541,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101379/making-graphs-in-r-markdown#comment102594541_58101379"},{"owner":{"reputation":2534,"user_id":3840401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6beea3c87703df1cfca0c57fac87f866?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vincent Guillemot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3840401/vincent-guillemot"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569424364,"post_id":58101379,"comment_id":102594721,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101379/making-graphs-in-r-markdown#comment102594721_58101379"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12119884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a00ed5c651d4af0651ba782a2e8f215e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lr1026","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12119884/lr1026"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569426055,"post_id":58101379,"comment_id":102595687,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101379/making-graphs-in-r-markdown#comment102595687_58101379"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12119884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a00ed5c651d4af0651ba782a2e8f215e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lr1026","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12119884/lr1026"},"last_editor":{"reputation":134352,"user_id":2372064,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vFfVt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MrFlick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2372064/mrflick"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569423758,"creation_date":1569423639,"last_edit_date":1569423758,"question_id":58101379,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101379","body_markdown":"I am trying to create an R Markdown file with a few graphs.

They all start from version 1.0.0.0.\r\n - I finish developing my `feature-one` branch.  I merge it into `master` and do a ClickOnce publish from `master`.  After publishing, ClickOnce updates my `.csproj` file in `master` to have version 1.0.0.1, however it doesn&#39;t save the `.csproj` file to disk.  Now I have an uncommitted file in my repo.\r\n\r\nNow I have two options.  \r\n\r\nOption 1) I commit the change to my `.csproj` file to `master`.  The annoying thing about this is that now every time I publish a new version, I end up with another commit in my git history that says something like &quot;Published&quot; and only changed my `.csproj` file.\r\n\r\nOption 2) I don&#39;t commit the `.csproj` change to `master`.  Instead, I switch to branch `feature-two`, do some development, and then commit that `.csproj` file during the course of that development. A problem that will arise here is that if I need to create `feature-three` based on `master` and switch to it before I&#39;m done with `feature-two`, then `feature-three` will publish to version 1.0.0.1 (the same version that I published `feature-one` to) because I never saved the updated version number to `master`.\r\n\r\nHow should I be handling this situation?

the ``debounce`` function takes a *function* as the first argument and you are trying to call it with *event object*.

It takes a function and then returns another function that expects the same exact arguments. So if you just do: \r\n \r\n``handleTermChange = debounce(termChange)``  \r\n\r\nthen you should get a function that would take the event as it&#39;s first argument.

I will perform a database call with the variables I have passed to this route and build an object. I want to pass this object to an html page. Here is the python code for the app.route\r\n\r\n```\r\n@app.route(&#39;/studentSelected&#39;, methods=[&#39;GET&#39;,&#39;POST&#39;])\r\ndef studentSelected():\r\n    firstName = request.args.get(&#39;firstName&#39;, 0, type=str)\r\n    lastName = request.args.get(&#39;lastName&#39;, 0, type=str)\r\n    suffix = request.args.get(&#39;suffix&#39;, 0, type=str)\r\n    nickName = request.args.get(&#39;nickName&#39;, 0, type=str)\r\n    students = []    \r\n    con, cur = ConnectToDatabase()\r\n\r\n    SQL = &quot;select * from students where FirstName = ? and LastName = ? and Suffix = ? and NickName = ?&quot;\r\n    entities = (firstName, lastName, suffix, nickName)\r\n    student, cur = Execute(SQL, cur, entities)\r\n\r\n    return render_template(&#39;studentcard.html&#39;, student=student)\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently I get &quot;Method Not Allowed. The method is not allowed for the requested URL.&quot; which I interpret as I&#39;m not passing the right method to my route. But as you can I do pass both methods to my route. Why else would I be getting this error? studentcard.html exists in the folder templates. \r\n\r\nOne guess I have is that the return statement returns functionality to the getJSON function. \r\n\r\nWhat is a better strategy for this type of process. The end result is for the clicked image to run app.route, call the database and then redirect the webapp to a new route for studentSelected and load and run this page. \r\n\r\ncontents of studentcard.html\r\n```\r\n{% extends &#39;layout.html&#39; %}\r\n\r\n{% block body %}\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;container mt-3&quot;&gt;\r\n{% from &quot;includes/_formhelpers.html&quot; import

to answer your question around the uniqueidentifier field, you&#39;ll want to add a new guid to your model that&#39;s going into the database. You can do that with something like this, added before your `using` statement:\r\n\r\n    model.ID = Guid.NewGuid();\r\n\r\nMake sure you have a statement importing the &quot;System&quot; library as well at the top of your file, since the Guid object is part of that.\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n\r\nA Guid in your .NET code is just a 16-digit unique identifier, so it&#39;ll marry up real nice-like with your ID field in your database.\r\n\r\nSome clarity on how the database will work too - a count() function won&#39;t change on server reboots, the only time that&#39;s going to change is if the data itself is purged or changed. Hopefully that wouldn&#39;t be an issue, but if you&#39;re not sure I&#39;d ask someone at your company that may know how data cleanup works/if it happens ever and then go from there.\r\n\r\nYou shouldn&#39;t need to check for if the ID is null or empty on adding a new one like you listed - the point of a Guid is that it will 100% of the time be unique, so by virtue of adding that model.ID field as I showed above you should be able to avoid having to check for that.\r\n\r\nCheers!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101325/web-page-in-asp-net-and-entity-framework-giving-error-i-am-struggling-to-resolve/58101764#58101764","title":"Web page in ASP.NET and Entity Framework giving error I am struggling to resolve"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":4363893,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2c2c777dca878c1526c9d7c617cfe9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brenen Hatch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4363893/brenen-hatch"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":4363893,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e2c2c777dca878c1526c9d7c617cfe9d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brenen Hatch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4363893/brenen-hatch"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569432342,"creation_date":1569423465,"last_edit_date":1569432342,"question_id":58101325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101325","body_markdown":"**EDIT: RESOLVED THIS BY DELETING AND REMAKING ENTITY DB CONNECTION**\r\n\r\nI am creating a website that will take data from a form and store it in a database. I am using C#, ASP.NET and Entity Framework. I plan to host this website on a local server, the website/server may get restarted and I need the code to not write over any data. My web page in ASP.NET and Entity Framework giving error I am struggling to resolve. on my save db.SaveChanges(); is where the error arrives.\r\n\r\nI used to have my ID set as a unique identifier and it would go through except it wouldn&#39;t create new lines. So I changed my primary key to ID which is an int. \r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Web;\r\nusing System.Web.UI;\r\nusing System.Web.UI.WebControls;\r\nusing System.Web.UI.WebControls.WebParts;\r\nusing System.Web.UI.HtmlControls;\r\nusing System.Data.SqlClient;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Core;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.SqlServer;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Migrations;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.ModelConfiguration;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Spatial;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Utilities;\r\nusing System.Data.Entity.Validation;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nnamespace EngiData\r\n{\r\n    public partial class WebForm2 : System.Web.UI.Page\r\n    {\r\n        EandIForm model = new EandIForm();\r\n        \r\n\r\n        string idValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string productionValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string machineValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string nameValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string workOrderNumberValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string partNumberValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string prefixValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string programNumberValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string tFileValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string revisionValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string programmerValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string machineCollisionValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string probingValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string feedSpeedValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string spindleDirectionvalue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string depthOfCutValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string toolClearancesValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string toolCallOutValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string machineWorkOffSetValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string programDoesntMeetPrintValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string coolantCommandValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string gmValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string partTransferValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string programImprovementValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string otherValue = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        string details = &quot;&quot;;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        EandIEntities3 myDBEntities = new EandIEntities3();\r\n\r\n\r\n        SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(@&quot;Data Source=ste1sqlt01;Initial Catalog=EandI;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=*******;Password=*******&quot;);\r\n\r\n        //con.Open();\r\n        //SqlCommand cmd = con.CreateCommand();\r\n        //cmd.CommandType = System.Data.CommandType.Text;\r\n\r\n        //SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(@&quot;Data Source=ste1sqlt01;Initial Catalog=EandI;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=********;Password=*************&quot;);\r\n        protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void CheckBoxList1_SelectedIndexChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        protected void submitButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n\r\n            \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            if (productLineDropDown.SelectedItem.Value == &quot;0&quot;)\r\n            {\r\n                ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(this.GetType(), &quot;myalert&quot;, &quot;alert(&#39;&quot;

Here&#39;s what I have, so far:\r\n\r\n```\r\nblad_mor &lt;- read.csv(&quot;blad_mor.csv&quot;, header = T)\r\n\r\nstr(blad_mor)\r\n\r\nblad_mor_recode &lt;- gsub(C670:C679, 29010, blad_mor$cod)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI get this output for the ```str()``` command:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; str(blad_mor)\r\n&#39;data.frame&#39;:\t127073 obs. of  12 variables:\r\n $ year          : int  1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 1999 ...\r\n $ sex           : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;1&quot;,&quot;2&quot;,&quot;F&quot;,&quot;M&quot;: 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ...\r\n $ race          : Factor w/ 17 levels &quot;America&quot;,&quot;Asian &amp;&quot;,..: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 ...\r\n $ county        : Factor w/ 79 levels &quot;COUNTY1&quot;,&quot;COUNTY2&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\r\n $ cod           : Factor w/ 327 levels &quot;C001&quot;,&quot;C005&quot;,..: 89 108 108 294 63 42 172 74 85 269 ...\r\n $ fips          : int  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\r\n $ state         : int  5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ...\r\n $ race_code     : int  2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ...\r\n $ ethnicity     : Factor w/ 4 levels &quot;&quot;,&quot;Hispanic&quot;,..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\r\n $ ethnicity_code: int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut when I try the ```blad_mor_recode &lt;- gsub(C670:C679, 29010, blad_mor$cod)``` code I get this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; blad_mor_recode &lt;- gsub(C670:C679, 29010, blad_mor$cod)\r\nError in gsub(C670:C679, 29010, blad_mor$cod) : object &#39;C670&#39; not found\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I verify that there actually *is* that object by ```table(blad_mor$cod)``` with this being some of the output: \r\n\r\n```\r\nC578  C579   C58   C60  C601  C609   C61  C629  C631  C639   C64   C65   C66  C670  C672  C674  C675  C676 \r\n    2    43     4     1     1    53  6162    62     1    14  2911    30    47    1     4     1     1     2 \r\n C677  C678  C679  C680  C689  C690  C692  C693  C694  C695  C696  C699  C700  C701  C709   C71  C710  C711 \r\n    1     4  2776    35    77     1     4     5     1     1     8    45     7     3    11     1    29    34 \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe object &#39;C670&#39; has one instance as per this output, yet R is telling me it is not there &amp; doesn&#39;t run the command. What am I missing here? Should I change the class type from factor to something else? I&#39;m quite confused.  \r\n\r\nEdit: I have tried quotes around the character strings (e.g. ```blad_mor_recode &lt;- gsub(&#39;C670:C679&#39;, &#39;29010&#39;, blad_mor$cod)``` as well as ifelse(). I still get the same error message.

You can see it live here https://www.sanatoriums.com/en/our-team. Initially the navbar is hidden behind the contact box so you have to scroll down a little. http://prntscr.com/paurza\r\n\r\nThe menu content slides from the side after clicking on the button. In every other mobile browser this works as it should, but on iOS the menu actually slides out but it is completely TRANSPARENT (background, text, everything). You can click the items in the menu, you just can&#39;t see them.

Should it be this way...\r\n\r\nWhat I am doing is:\r\n\r\n 1. Query Users (with just 5 ones at this moment) Table using Query Builder (DB) and do something like : `$users-&gt;each(function($i) use ($query)){`\r\n 2. Inside &quot;.each&quot; loop, I just call:\r\n\r\n&gt; $users-&gt;each(function($i) use ($query){\r\n\r\n&gt; $query-&gt;update([&#39;fk_user&#39; =&gt; $i-&gt;id, &#39;status&#39; =&gt; 1, &#39;updated_at&#39; =\r\n&gt; \\Carbon\\Carbon::now()]);\r\n\r\n3. So, **the result should be 150 updates** in a block of 30 matches for each user!\r\n4. But when I query the table there is 300 updates in place.\r\n5. Why?\r\n\r\nAnd I really can&#180;t understand why!\r\n\r\nThis is exactly the way doing things here:\r\n\r\n    $query = DB::table(&#39;records as bp&#39;)\r\n\t-&gt;whereRaw(&#39;bp.control = &#39;.$control.&#39; AND bp.status = 0&#39;)\r\n\t-&gt;limit(30);\r\n\t\r\n    $users = Users::all();\r\n\t$users-&gt;each(function($i) use ($query){\r\n\t\t\t$query-&gt;update([&#39;fk_user&#39; =&gt; $i-&gt;id, &#39;status&#39; =&gt; 1, &#39;updated_at&#39; =&gt; \\Carbon\\Carbon::now()]);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n**Important : I already tried to declare $query inside &quot;each&quot; and the result was the same!**\r\n\r\nThanks for any support here.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101244/laravel-5-8-how-to-update-table-inside-loop","title":"Laravel 5.8 - How-to UPDATE Table Inside Loop"},{"tags":["go"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11925999,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/um833.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mantas Silanskas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11925999/mantas-silanskas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423610,"post_id":58101243,"comment_id":102594256,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101243/sending-an-email-results-in-an-empty-email#comment102594256_58101243"},{"owner":{"reputation":204107,"user_id":1705598,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aTFoe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"icza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1705598/icza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423667,"post_id":58101243,"comment_id":102594300,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101243/sending-an-email-results-in-an-empty-email#comment102594300_58101243"},{"owner":{"reputation":18931,"user_id":603316,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4db0c2cbf2d5c9c196902dfc9db8218d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/603316/peter"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423697,"post_id":58101243,"comment_id":102594322,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101243/sending-an-email-results-in-an-empty-email#comment102594322_58101243"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11925999,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/um833.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mantas Silanskas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11925999/mantas-silanskas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":45645,"user_id":13860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bdc06836b7bcec9fce2c5c6e5242192?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Flimzy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13860/flimzy"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569423661,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569423704,"creation_date":1569423213,"last_edit_date":1569423407,"question_id":58101243,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101243","body_markdown":"I was trying send email using [this example](https://medium.com/glottery/sending-emails-with-go-golang-and-gmail-39bc20423cf0).\r\n\r\n    from := &quot;nottoday@gmail.com&quot;\r\n    password := &quot;u wont get my passowrd ;)*&quot;\r\n    to := []string{&quot;nottoday@gmail.com&quot;}\r\n    smtpServer := smtpServer{host: &quot;smtp.gmail.com&quot;, port: &quot;587&quot;}\r\n    message := &quot;Total Reisai: &quot; + reisaiLenght + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;Total GPS: &quot; + gpsLenght\r\n    auth := smtp.PlainAuth(&quot;&quot;, from, password, smtpServer.host)\r\n    err2 := smtp.SendMail(smtpServer.Address(), auth, from, to, []byte(message))\r\n    if err2 != nil {\r\n        fmt.Println(err2)\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    fmt.Println(&quot;Email Sent!&quot;)\r\n\r\nIf I add []byte(message) I can send reisaiLenght and gpsLenght without spaces: 250260 but if I tried to send more clear message as one in my code I just get empty email.\r\n\r\nAnd second question.

_ = sess.run([loss, train])\r\n            loss_list.append(loss_val)\r\n\r\nWithout changing the part that creates `tensorflow` graph, you only need to put `loss` inside `sess.run()`\r\n\r\nAs long as you know the real-time `loss` value, you can have another feed dictionary for test dataset (so I advise you not using `tf.constant`, but instead using `tf.placeholder` for feeding the data), and have another `sess.run` for computing the loss on testset.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nI have refactored your code, basically, I replaced `tf.constant` with `tf.placeholder`, so you can have multiple feed dictionaries interact with one `tensorflow` graph. \r\n\r\n    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n    import tensorflow as tf\r\n    \r\n    tf.reset_default_graph()\r\n    \r\n    x_train =

plt.legend(loc=&#39;best&#39;)\r\n\r\nBy running the code, you can see both the test loss and the training loss is getting smaller. And you can insert whatever logic is needed after the train loss is evaluated. \r\n\r\nOne very important thing is when I use `feeddict_test` in `sess.run(loss, feed_dict=feeddict_test)`, the model is not trained, but only the test loss is evaluated on the test dataset.

    Sheets(&quot;Geotechnical Risk Register&quot;).Select\r\n\r\nThis is where problems begin. Where is this worksheet? If it&#39;s in *whatever workbook happens to be active*, then there&#39;s run-time error 9 &quot;subscript out of range&quot; waiting to remind you that *whatever workbook happens to be active* may not necessarily have a worksheet by that name.\r\n\r\nIf the sheet is in the same workbook that hosts your VBA code, then you *don&#39;t* want &quot;whatever workbook is currently active&quot;, but `ThisWorkbook` - this would already be better:\r\n\r\n    ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(&quot;Geotechnical Risk Register&quot;).Select\r\n\r\nBut, you don&#39;t *need* to `.Select` anything. Consider:\r\n\r\n    Dim ws As Worksheet\r\n    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(&quot;Geotechnical Risk Register&quot;)\r\n\r\nMuch better: now we can make member calls against that specific sheet, and we *know* we&#39;re working against the right sheet.\r\n\r\nExcept, if the sheet exists in `ThisWorkbook` at compile-time, then it&#39;s completely redundant.\r\n\r\nSelect the sheet module in the VBE&#39;s *Project Explorer* toolwindow (Ctrl+R), then bring up its *properties* (F4). At the top of the properties list is a `(Name)` property that&#39;s currently probably something like `Sheet42` - change that to something more meaningful, say, `GeotechRiskRegisterSheet`. Now you have a global-scope (project-scope, actually) object variable named `GeotechRiskRegisterSheet` that you can use anywhere in your VBA project to refer to *that particular sheet*.\r\n\r\nThe rest of this answer assumes you&#39;ve done that. If the sheet isn&#39;t in `ThisWorkbook`, then stick to declaring a local `Worksheet` variable for it, and pulling the `Worksheet` object reference from the `Workbook.Worksheets` collection *of the workbook you mean to work with*.\r\n\r\n&gt;     Set assetTbl = Application.Range(&quot;M002_&quot;)\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s assigning to a variable that appears to want to be a local variable, but isn&#39;t declared anywhere in the local scope. `Application.Range` is only slightly better than just `Range`, and only one level of indirection away from the most-explicit `ActiveSheet.Range` - but then again, you *don&#39;t* mean to work off *whatever the ActiveSheet is*, and while tables *do* defined named ranges and named ranges *can* be accessed with the `Range` property, this would be much clearer and absolutely unambiguous:\r\n\r\n    Dim assetTbl As ListObject\r\n    Set assetTbl = GeotechRiskRegisterSheet.ListObjects(&quot;M002_&quot;)\r\n\r\nSame applies to the other two:\r\n\r\n&gt;     Set riskTbl = Application.Range(&quot;geotechRisks&quot;) &#39;GRR\r\n&gt;     Set compiledTbl = Application.Range(&quot;CompiledM002&quot;) &#39;Output for M002\r\n\r\nGo with:\r\n\r\n    Dim riskTbl As ListObject\r\n    Set riskTbl = GeotechRisksSheet.ListObjects(&quot;geotechRisks&quot;)\r\n\r\n    Dim compiledTbl As ListObject\r\n    Set compiledTbl = CompiledSheet.ListObjects(&quot;CompiledM002&quot;)\r\n\r\nAnd then we start looping:\r\n\r\n&gt;     For iRowRisk = 1 To riskTbl.Rows.Count &#39;loop through risks\r\n\r\nIf `riskTbl` is just another `Range`, then that works. If `riskTbl` is a `ListObject`, we can do simpler &amp; faster:\r\n\r\n    Dim currentRow As ListRow\r\n    For Each currentRow In riskTbl.ListRows\r\n\r\nAnd then we get to the run-time error you&#39;re asking about:\r\n\r\n&gt;     tmpRiskID = riskTbl.Row.Range(&quot;Ref No. ID&quot;) &#39;Temporary risk as it gets overridden\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s error 424 &quot;object required&quot;, because `riskTbl.Row` is a `Long` integer value: it doesn&#39;t have a `Range` member, so you can&#39;t do `Range.Row.Range` like this. If you&#39;re iterating a plain `Range` with that `For iRowRisk` loop, then you want that to look something like:\r\n\r\n    tmpRiskID = riskTbl.Cells(iRowRisk, 12).Value\r\n\r\nWhere `12` is a hard-coded column index referring to the &quot;Ref No. ID&quot; column. Not ideal, is it? Compare to leveraging the `ListObject` API:\r\n\r\n    Dim refIDColumn As Long\r\n    refIDColumn = riskTbl.ListColumns(&quot;Ref No. ID&quot;).Index\r\n\r\n    tmpRiskID = currentRow.Range.Cells(ColumnIndex:=refIDColumn).Value\r\n\r\nIf you define the `refIDColumn` variable outside the loop, every iteration can reuse its value, and as long as the header caption remains &quot;Ref No. ID&quot;, the column can be anywhere the user wants it - whereas with a hard-coded column index, if the user inserts a new column, the code breaks.\r\n\r\n&gt;         &#39;if assets chainage match risk iRowRisk (4 conditions)\r\n&gt;         If (en &gt; c1 And en &lt; c2) Or (st &gt; c1 And en &lt; c2) Or (st &gt; c1 And st &lt; c2) Or (st &lt; c1 And en &gt; c2) Then\r\n\r\nI&#39;m hoping you have declared and assigned these variables in your actual code - otherwise this conditional expression can&#39;t be evaluated reliably, since none of these identifiers have a value. Consider using meaningful names that convey usage intent: `en`, `st`, `c1`, and `c2` mean absolutely nothing to anyone that isn&#39;t extremely familiar with the thought process of whoever wrote that code. In any case, make sure the top of the module says `Option Explicit` somewhere.\r\n\r\n&gt;             &#39;copy asset row\r\n&gt;             assetTbl.Rows(iRowAsset).Copy\r\n&gt;             &#39;paste row in compiled\r\n&gt;             compiledTbl.Rows(xlEndRow).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues\r\n&gt;             &#39;paste risk id in last column of that row\r\n&gt;             compiledTbl.Cells(xlEndRow, ColumnH).Value = tmpRiskID\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not convinced you actually need to involve the clipboard here. Again, consider leveraging the `ListObject` API - this should work (untested):\r\n\r\n        With compiledTbl.ListRows.Add\r\n            .Range.Value = currentRow.Range.Value\r\n            .Range.Cells(ColumnIndex:=compiledRiskIdColumn).Value = tmpRiskID\r\n        End With\r\n\r\nWhere `compiledRiskIdColumn` would be declared and assigned before the loop body:\r\n\r\n    Dim compiledRiskIdColumn As Long\r\n    compiledRiskIdColumn = compieldTbl.ListColumns(&quot;Risk ID&quot;).Index &#39;&lt;~ verify column title\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58101223/run-time-error-424-object-required-unsure-what-ive-written-wrong-in-this-co/58103995#58103995","title":"Run-time error &#39;424&#39; Object required - Unsure what I&#39;ve written wrong in this code?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12112109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7644308fce7e82e80e5a7164a2194e2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MAfs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12112109/mafs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2264,"user_id":6248219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bcdde87fb76a1bd9d3e079895abfbea7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6248219/louis"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58103995,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569433774,"creation_date":1569423141,"last_edit_date":1569423273,"question_id":58101223,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58101223","body_markdown":"    Sub automated_gr_lookup()\r\n        Dim st As Long\r\n        Dim en As Long\r\n        Dim c1 As Long\r\n        Dim c2 As Long\r\n        Dim iRowAsset As Integer\r\n        Dim table As Range\r\n        Dim tmpRiskID As Variant\r\n    \r\n        Sheets(&quot;Geotechnical Risk Register&quot;).Select\r\n    \r\n        Application.ScreenUpdating = False\r\n    \r\n        Set assetTbl = Application.Range(&quot;M002_&quot;) &#39;Asset table = DES M002\r\n        Set riskTbl = Application.Range(&quot;geotechRisks&quot;) &#39;GRR\r\n        Set compiledTbl = Application.Range(&quot;CompiledM002&quot;) &#39;Output for M002\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        For iRowRisk = 1 To riskTbl.Rows.Count &#39;loop through risks\r\n            tmpRiskID = riskTbl.Row.Range(&quot;Ref No. ID&quot;) &#39;Temporary risk as it gets overridden\r\n        \r\n            \r\n            &#39;if assets chainage match risk iRowRisk (4 conditions)\r\n            If (en &gt; c1 And en &lt; c2) Or (st &gt; c1 And en &lt; c2) Or (st &gt; c1 And st &lt; c2) Or (st &lt; c1 And en &gt; c2) Then\r\n                &#39;copy asset row\r\n                assetTbl.Rows(iRowAsset).Copy\r\n                &#39;paste row in compiled\r\n                compiledTbl.Rows(xlEndRow).PasteSpecial xlPasteValues\r\n                &#39;paste risk id in last column of that row\r\n                compiledTbl.Cells(xlEndRow, ColumnH).Value = tmpRiskID\r\n            End If\r\n        Next iRowRisk\r\n        \r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;m getting a `runtime error 424` on the line `tmpRiskID = riskTbl.Row.Range(&quot;Ref No. ID&quot;)` and unsure why?

The elements of the collection are polymorphic, not sharing the properties I am trying to include, and tracked in the DB via TPH (Table-per-Hierachry). When I try to eager load them an exception is thrown stating that the base class does not contain the requested property.\r\n\r\nI have an abstract base class `Base` and two derived classes `DerivedA` and `DerivedB`. `Base` has been configured for TPH like this\r\n\r\n```\r\ninternal static void Configure(ModelBuilder builder)\r\n{\r\n    // Get the EntityTypeBuilder from the given ModelBuilder\r\n    EntityTypeBuilder&lt;Base&gt; entityBuilder = builder.Entity&lt;Base&gt;();\r\n\r\n    // Configure TPH\r\n    entityBuilder.ToTable(&quot;Bases&quot;).HasDiscriminator&lt;int&gt;(&quot;DerivedType&quot;)\r\n                 .HasValue&lt;DerivedA&gt;(0)\r\n                 .HasValue&lt;DerivedB&gt;(1);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFurthermore I have a class `ToBeLoaded` with a property `public ICollection&lt;Base&gt; Bases {get; set; }` which does contain both `DerivedA` and `DerivedB`. I am expecting EF Core to be able to handle this. Am I wrong with that?\r\n\r\nThe [EF Core Docs][1] say I can use `as` or a direct cast within `ThenInclude()` like I do in my extension method.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static IQueryable&lt;ToBeLoaded&gt; LoadRelated(this DbSet&lt;ToBeLoaded&gt; toBeLoadedSet)\r\n{\r\n    return toBeLoadedSet.Include(tbl =&gt; tbl.Bases)\r\n                               .ThenInclude(b =&gt; (b as DerivedA).PropA)\r\n                               .Include(tbl =&gt; tbl.Bases)\r\n                               .ThenInclude(b =&gt; (b as DerviedB).PropB);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen then calling `context.ToBeLoadedSet.LoadRelated.ToList();` the following exception is thrown\r\n\r\n```\r\nSystem.InvalidOperationException: &#39;The property &#39;PropA&#39; is not a navigation property of entity type &#39;Base&#39;. The &#39;Include(string)&#39; method can only be used with a &#39;.&#39; separated list of navigation property names.&#39;\r\n```\r\nI already tried to use the other ways to achieve this suggested in the docs, namely direct cast and the `Include(string)` method.\r\nI am aware that this is somewhat different from the example in the docs, but that is the closest thing to my situation I could find.\r\n\r\nIs this even theoretically possible using the Include interface or should I just try to use [RawSQL][2]?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

So, my question is asking when &quot;I MASK a dog everyday&quot; and &quot;I byte a dog everyday&quot; are inputted into the same pretrained BERT model using large corpora with common senses and
