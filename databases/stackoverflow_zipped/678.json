If both tables are always 1 to 1 (every time a row goes into first table it must also always go into second table) then yes, combine them, save the space of the duplicate data and indexes. If it is possible for the two tables to have different entries (one always a row per &quot;incident&quot; but the other may not or data sometimes in first table and sometimes in second) the keep them as two to minimize the dead space per row. The data should drive the table designs. You don&#39;t say how many rows you are talking. If the rows, tables, and DB are small, does it really matter other than trying to design well (always a good idea)?\r\n\r\nAnother related consideration is how much data is already in the current design and how much effort is needed to convert to a different design?

Each thread is attempting to write a single &quot;message&quot; at a time, and message data from different threads must not be interleaved.\r\n\r\nTCP is a byte stream, it has no concept of &quot;messages&quot; like UDP does.  You MUST synchronize access to a TCP socket, such as with a mutex, to avoid interweaving the &quot;messages&quot;.\r\n\r\n&gt; I am prepared for send() to return EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN in a minority of cases (in which case I just defer the write of the message to an asynchronous thread using a mutex protected queuing structure)\r\n\r\nIn which case, you will likely need to send MOST/ALL of your &quot;messages&quot; through that same queue, so it can ensure that they get sent in the proper order.  If you start sending a &quot;message&quot; directly and it gets an `EWOULDBLOCK`/`EAGAIN` error, the remaining unsent data for that &quot;message&quot;, and all subsequent &quot;messages&quot;, MUST be queued until the queue is emptied.  Whenever the socket is writable, send whatever is in the queue, removing only what is successfully sent, and repeating as needed until the queue is emptied.  Only then can you safely send new &quot;messages&quot; directly until another `EWOULDBLOCK`/`EAGAIN` error is reported.  But no matter what, you will still need to synchronize the sends so only 1 &quot;message&quot; is being sent at a time, whether directly or from the queue.\r\n\r\nFor example, you can do something like this (pseudo code):\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid sendMsg(message msg)\r\n{\r\n    lock(&amp;mutex);\r\n    if (!queue.empty()) {\r\n        queue.add(&amp;msg, sizeof(msg));\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        byte *ptr = &amp;msg;\r\n        size_t size = sizeof(msg);\r\n        do {\r\n            int sent = send(sock, ptr, size, 0);\r\n            if (sent == -1) {\r\n                if (errno == EINTR) continue;\r\n                queue.add(ptr, size);\r\n                break;\r\n            }\r\n            ptr += sent;\r\n            size -= sent;\r\n        }\r\n        while (size &gt; 0);\r\n    }\r\n    unlock(&amp;mutex);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvoid socketIsWritable()\r\n{\r\n    lock(&amp;mutex);\r\n    while (!queue.empty()) {\r\n        int sent = send(sock, queue.data(), queue.size(), 0);\r\n        if (sent == -1) {\r\n            if (errno == EINTR) continue;\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n        queue.remove(sent);\r\n    }\r\n    unlock(&amp;mutex);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; I cannot get mutexes on these foreground writing threads (apart from the EWOULDBLOCK/EAGAIN cases), as the implied cache flushes give me an unacceptable CPU impact (this also means no use of other synchronization objects to work around the problem, such as atomic integers).\r\n\r\nSynchronizing access to the socket is the only way to ensure the integrity of the &quot;messages&quot; you want to send.  Which does mean there will be a small bottleneck in your communications. You can&#39;t begin sending a new &quot;message&quot; until a previous &quot;message&quot; has finished being sent in full.\r\n\r\n&gt; As far as I know, I cannot guarantee that send() won&#39;t decide to write some, but not all of any given message, thus resulting in (potentially) interleaved data\r\n\r\nCorrect.\r\n\r\n&gt; Is there any way to force send() to either buffer the entire message or none of it (when using non-blocking IO)?\r\n\r\nNo.  And even if it could, that would still not prevent against interweaving when multiple threads try to call `send()` at the same time. You need to handle the necessary buffering in your own code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380525/multithreaded-use-of-sock-stream-sockets/58384045#58384045","title":"Multithreaded use of SOCK_STREAM sockets"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12215547,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc2c60a8a634b78119f5193bd9ca611a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Lloyd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12215547/steve-lloyd"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571087945,"creation_date":1571069726,"question_id":58380525,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58380525","body_markdown":"I&#39;m attempting to solve a multi-threaded socket use issue in my pthreaded Linux code, and I think it might be insoluble, given my requirements.

Is there any way to force send() to either buffer the entire message or none of it (when using non-blocking IO)?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380525/multithreaded-use-of-sock-stream-sockets","title":"Multithreaded use of SOCK_STREAM sockets"},{"tags":["postgresql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571076326,"post_id":58380522,"comment_id":103112114,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380522/accelerating-postgres-group-by#comment103112114_58380522"},{"owner":{"reputation":6416,"user_id":1358308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9448dee25fd2278def77cb7f0353574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sam Mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1358308/sam-mason"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571076994,"post_id":58380522,"comment_id":103112378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380522/accelerating-postgres-group-by#comment103112378_58380522"},{"owner":{"reputation":6587,"user_id":222151,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbbe2adedf4308c5978d92fa1a8dbbff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cjm2671","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/222151/cjm2671"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571077263,"post_id":58380522,"comment_id":103112478,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380522/accelerating-postgres-group-by#comment103112478_58380522"},{"owner":{"reputation":6416,"user_id":1358308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9448dee25fd2278def77cb7f0353574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sam Mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1358308/sam-mason"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571077741,"post_id":58380522,"comment_id":103112659,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380522/accelerating-postgres-group-by#comment103112659_58380522"},{"owner":{"reputation":6587,"user_id":222151,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbbe2adedf4308c5978d92fa1a8dbbff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cjm2671","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/222151/cjm2671"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571078448,"post_id":58380522,"comment_id":103112936,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380522/accelerating-postgres-group-by#comment103112936_58380522"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6416,"user_id":1358308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9448dee25fd2278def77cb7f0353574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sam Mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1358308/sam-mason"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571144486,"creation_date":1571144486,"answer_id":58395358,"question_id":58380522,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58395358","body_markdown":"a couple of background points:\r\n\r\n * [statistics](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/planner-stats.html) look good, i.e. it&#39;s guessing roughly how many rows it&#39;ll get back and seems to be propagating this information correctly.  this is important because lots of times the query planner does the &quot;wrong thing&quot; because it doesn&#39;t have a very good idea of the data in the table\r\n\r\n * 1.8 seconds (i.e. ~90% of the time) is spent executing `Parallel Bitmap Heap Scan on clicks`, this is fetching the actual data from the table that the index scan identified as relevant\r\n\r\nwhile executing this query PG is therefore likely spending most of its time doing IO, and only a small amount amount of time processing the data.  the aim would therefore be to either make it read the data more efficiently or just to read less data\r\n\r\n * creating an index specifically for this query, as suggested by @Bergi,  would allow PG not to read the data from the table but this will only tend to optimise a few specific queries, see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/indexes-index-only-scans.html for the official docs\r\n\r\n * random access is much slower than sequential, so you could try rearranging the table to optimise for this query, e.g. see https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-cluster.html but this comes with lots of caveats and probably won&#39;t help you long term (but is sometimes useful!)\r\n\r\n * normalising your table so rows don&#39;t take as much storage space can help, but if rows are still randomly scattered throughout the table then this isn&#39;t going to help much\r\n\r\n * a faster IO subsystem, especially something that can do faster random IO, will help everything, but will obviously cost more on an ongoing basis\r\n\r\n * cache results, if you&#39;re doing this a lot you can save the results into a different table (or &quot;materialised view&quot;) and use that rather than going to the source data all the time\r\n\r\nbasically what&#39;s &quot;best&quot;

In terms of just the *types*, the compiler can&#39;t tell the difference between what you&#39;re trying to do, and the definitely unsafe code here:\r\n\r\n    function badCopy(k1: keyof ITest, k2: keyof ITest, o: ITest) {\r\n      o[k2] = o[k1]; // error!\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere, the key `k1` and `k2` are exactly the same type: `keyof ITest`.  But there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re trying to blindly copy a property from one key to an incompatible property at another key.  Because the key *values* in `k1` and `k2` might not be the same, despite being the same type.  That&#39;s unsafe, so you get an error.\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\nUnfortunately that change also causes what you&#39;re doing to get deemed as &quot;possibly unsafe&quot; even though you know for sure that `e` is the same exact value in both the read and the write.  This is currently considered a [design limitation](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/31445) in TypeScript, although it&#39;s possible that they might consider [special-casing identical key identifiers](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32693#issuecomment-518311469).  If you care about that, you might want to go to the related GitHub issue (it looks like [microsoft/TypeScript#32693](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/32693) is still listed as &quot;in discussion&quot;) and give it a &#128077; or describe your use case if it&#39;s more compelling than what&#39;s listed there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat being said there are workarounds until and unless that gets resolved:\r\n\r\nThe compiler still allows the [loophole](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/30769#issuecomment-498428559) where an *identical* type is assignable to itself, as long as the compiler can&#39;t see that you are using a union-type as your key type.  Often you can make your functions more [generic](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/generics.html), like this:\r\n\r\n    function copy&lt;K extends keyof ITest&gt;(e: K, source: ITest, dest: ITest) {  \r\n      dest[e] = source[e]; // no error now\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr, if you don&#39;t want to do that, just accept that you know better than the compiler here and use a [type assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#type-assertions) to tell it not to worry:\r\n\r\n    function copyAssert(e: keyof ITest, source: ITest, dest: ITest) {\r\n      dest[e] = source[e] as any; // one way\r\n      dest[e] = source[e] as ITest[&quot;first&quot;] &amp; ITest[&quot;second&quot;]; // more explicit \r\n    }\r\n\r\nHopefully one of those works for you.  Good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to code](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#code/JYOwLgpgTgZghgYwgAgJIBUIGczIN4BQyyMwUOA-ABQBucANgFzIgCuAtgEbQA0y7WAObMcUUIICUzGgHtgAEwDcRZFggIZIedSnJZCggF8CBGKxAIwwTck5x5AYRkAHAJ5UA1gEZmHiK5kYNEwcPg8AJl9-QODsMD4ZZgw4iXwVGQBtCIBdZABeZEzvbMVkAHoy5GgoGSgjE1NzS2sQZA03AHEIEGhgBAAeAGkqgA9ILSxkPwCg5JwAPioIZkG+LBlWKCQkkPjkeTidlLTiA5wMiFyC9c2kC5L6xosrG3bXAEEsNSgwJaiZ2KhVQbLbLQF7M5gI44VKEU5xe75YG3CCIuCTOAgVylCqFHrIADucFcKkhiOuILul2Q6PBGQARKRyGB6bkAGR0+lqDRaVk4yrsWooCAjZz0PrAXBGIA)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380515/copying-a-same-key-property-error-in-typescript/58382518#58382518","title":"Copying a same-key property error in TypeScript"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1899,"user_id":202059,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/d7PGT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"cmaynard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/202059/cmaynard"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571079181,"creation_date":1571079181,"answer_id":58382543,"question_id":58380515,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58382543","body_markdown":"Look at the signatures of your two properties:\r\n\r\n    (val: number, msg: string) =&gt; void\r\nand \r\n\r\n    () =&gt; void\r\nThe error you are getting looks like the compiler is saying you are assigning across keys.

Below is the source code for that.\r\n\r\n    abstract class CompletableInteractor&lt;PARAMS&gt;(\r\n    private val executionThread: ExecutionThread,\r\n    private val postExecutionThread: PostExecutionThread) {\r\n\r\n    private val disposables = CompositeDisposable()\r\n    protected abstract fun buildUseCase(params: PARAMS?): Completable\r\n\r\n    private var isInProgress = false\r\n\r\n    fun execute(observer: CompletableObserver, params: PARAMS? = null) {\r\n        val subscribeWith = this.buildUseCase(params)\r\n            .subscribeOn(executionThread.scheduler) //io\r\n            .observeOn(postExecutionThread.scheduler) // AndroidMainThread\r\n            .subscribeWith(observer)}\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow here is my Interactor code which is trying to work with this Completable use case\r\n\r\n    class ApplicationSearchInteractor @Inject constructor(\r\n    private val dataService: DataService,\r\n    @Named(ComputationThread.computation) executionThread: ExecutionThread,\r\n    postExecutionThread: PostExecutionThread) : CompletableInteractor&lt;String&gt;(executionThread, postExecutionThread) {\r\n    \r\n    override fun buildUseCase(params: String?): Completable {\r\n        return dataService.doSomeCompletable(params)}}\r\n\r\nNow here is the implementation of the DataService\r\n\r\n    class DataUploadRepository @Inject constructor(){\r\n\r\n    override fun doSomeCompletable(name: String?): Completable {\r\n        name?.let {\r\n            return Completable.complete()\r\n        } ?: kotlin.run {\r\n            return Completable.error(NullPointerException())\r\n            }\r\n        }   }\r\n\r\nNow What I am trying to do here is writing test case for the ApplicationSearchInteractor and trying to \r\nmake the Completable.complete() and Completable.error test cases passed by passing name null and some no null values which do not happen.\r\n\r\nEven I have created a test app putting all these things together calling interactor from the presenter. But none of the callbacks of the CompletableObserver are getting called.\r\nI am completely blank now what are the mistakes I am making as I did the same thing with Observable and everything was great with it.\r\nPresenter code\r\n\r\n    class DataUploadPresenter @Inject constructor(private val applicationSearchInteractor: CompletableInteractor&lt;String&gt;) {\r\n\r\n    fun registerApplications(callingApp: String) {\r\n        applicationSearchInteractor.execute(applicationFoundObserver, null)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    private val applicationFoundObserver = object : CompletableObserver {\r\n        override fun onSubscribe(d: Disposable) {\r\n\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        override fun onComplete() {\r\n            print(&quot;hello&quot;)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        override fun onError(e: Throwable) {\r\n            print(&quot;error&quot;)\r\n            //e.printStackTrace()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }}\r\n\r\nWhen I try to complete or error Completable it doesn&#39;t call its respective callbacks of CompletableObserver\r\n\r\n**EDIT: I observed something strange now. the kotlin&#39;s print methods are not getting printed hence it appeared to me that the callbacks are not triggering. My bad but don&#39;t know why these prints methods are not printing on an android studio.**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380466/completable-of-rxjava-is-not-completing-or-erroring","title":"Completable of RxJava is not completing or erroring"},{"tags":["java","json"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20780,"user_id":2192903,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mNrNH.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arnaud Denoyelle","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2192903/arnaud-denoyelle"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1571069681,"post_id":58380465,"comment_id":103109464,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380465/write-json-array-and-object-with-java#comment103109464_58380465"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1188,"user_id":6469772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uAnFm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"LHCHIN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6469772/lhchin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571104923,"creation_date":1571104923,"answer_id":58386233,"question_id":58380465,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58386233","body_markdown":"Here it is!

I initialize the child with a prop value &quot;Fake Url 1&quot; and replacing it with the value from the promise in useEffect(), which is the first Hook to be loaded once the component loads. But the child is not refreshing even though I changed the prop from parent.\r\n\r\n**What I tried**\r\n1) So Im changing the &quot;props&quot; of the child after the promise is complete. Shouldnt that re-render the child with new props ? (I thought props are similar to input and output in angular) \r\n2) I did try to change the state of the parent and force a total reload, but that triggered an infinite loop, not sure why.\r\nThe code which Im trying is ==&gt; https://codepen.io/rohit2219/pen/mddPPaG\r\n```\r\nconst { useEffect } = React;\r\nconst { useState } = React;\r\n\r\nconst Child = props =&gt; {\r\n  let childUrl = props.url;\r\n\r\n  //return (&lt;div&gt;{props.user}&lt;/div&gt;)\r\n  return &lt;div&gt;Child url : {childUrl}&lt;/div&gt;;\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst Parent = () =&gt; {\r\n  let childData = &quot;Fake Url 1&quot;;\r\n  const [state, setState] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    childData = &quot;Fake Url 2&quot;;\r\n    let promise = axios.get(`https://api.github.com/users/mojombo`);\r\n    promise.then(function(data) {\r\n      console.log(data);\r\n      childData = data.data.url;\r\n      //setState(true) &gt;&gt; This state change triggered an infinite loop\r\n      console.log(&quot;childData:&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n  });\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n      &lt;Child url={childData} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(&lt;Parent /&gt;, document.getElementById(&quot;app&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did see many examples for doing that for a Class based React components like below, but nothing for functional components.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/43718481/updating-childs-state-from-parent-component","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380461/refresh-a-react-child-functional-component-based-on-async-input-from-parent","title":"Refresh

answer:\r\n\r\nYour delete query has a syntax error.   This was hinted at in the comments... \r\n\r\nYou’re also mixing server side and client side by trying to use JavaScript in a php class. That’s a major mistake and requires some going back to review the basics. \r\n\r\nLong answer:\r\n\r\nI perceive you’re trying to move towards OOP programming, and you’re doing some things right; notably, injecting the database connection into your crud object. \r\n\r\nBut there’s some things that could be done better.  Here’s a few ideas—\r\n\r\n1.  [Use PDO][1] instead of mysqli, and ***use prepared statements***. Very likely this would have eliminated the syntax error in the query. \r\n2.  Always return json encoded data from Ajax requests. I personally always have the php script respond with something like `return json_encode( [&#39;message&#39;=&gt;$message, &#39;data&#39;=&gt;$data] );`. Then your JavaScript back in the browser can decide what to communicate to the user. \r\n3.  Methods should do One Thing. If the method gets bigger than what fits on the screen, you probably need to refactor.  For example, `getRecords()` checks for page number, creates a query, gets total number, and gets all records. This should probably be broken up into separate methods, or better yet, create a pagination object that could be injected into the query creation method. \r\n\r\nBTW, to illustrate how important the prepared statements are:  what if someone went to `hxxp://yourdomain/exam_package_response.php?action=delete&amp;edit_pkg_id=1+or+1%3D1`?\r\n\r\nAnswer:  ***you just lost all the data in this table***.  Prepared statements will prevent this.\r\n  [1]: https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#prepared","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380457/only-delete-option-is-not-working-php-crud/58385173#58385173","title":"only Delete option is not working PHP CRUD"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":4100399,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae323315b0174bcaa8863a76883be9f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gbenga wale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4100399/gbenga-wale"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571170843,"post_id":58402005,"comment_id":103149179,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380457/only-delete-option-is-not-working-php-crud/58402005#comment103149179_58402005"},{"owner":{"reputation":651,"user_id":1662394,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7p637.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mahadev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662394/mahadev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571207161,"post_id":58402005,"comment_id":103158024,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380457/only-delete-option-is-not-working-php-crud/58402005#comment103158024_58402005"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":4100399,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ae323315b0174bcaa8863a76883be9f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gbenga wale","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4100399/gbenga-wale"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571170242,"creation_date":1571170242,"answer_id":58402005,"question_id":58380457,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58402005","body_markdown":"In the \r\n\r\n&gt; deleteExamPackage($params) function\r\n\r\non line 7, before the echo statement, you forgot to add \r\n\r\n&gt; =\r\n\r\nchange this \r\n\r\n    `$sql = &quot;delete from `tblExamPackages` WHERE pkg_id&#39;&quot; . $_REQUEST[&quot;edit_pkg_id&quot;] . &quot;&#39;&quot;;`\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    $sql = `&quot;delete from `tblExamPackages` WHERE pkg_id = &#39;&quot; . $_REQUEST[&quot;edit_pkg_id&quot;] . &quot;&#39;&quot;;`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380457/only-delete-option-is-not-working-php-crud/58402005#58402005","title":"only Delete option is not working PHP CRUD"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":651,"user_id":1662394,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7p637.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mahadev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662394/mahadev"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571231291,"creation_date":1571231291,"answer_id":58414097,"question_id":58380457,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58414097","body_markdown":"I managed to solve the problem with the help of some fellow members&#39; guidance here.\r\n\r\nSo basically, I couldn&#39;t delete a row from my CRUD grid. And actually, I wasn&#39;t able to detect the error properly. As per the answers and comments above, I traced down the error and solved it.\r\n\r\nHere are the changes I made to make it work.\r\n\r\n&gt;Delete Query had a Syntax error.\r\n\r\nMy Delete query had a minor error. I missed `=` sign in `where` clause. Although that didn&#39;t original problem, that was an issue to solve.\r\n\r\n&gt;Wasn&#39;t getting `pkg_id` sent from `AJAX` to `PHP`.\r\n\r\nSo the core problem was, my query was executing but I wasn&#39;t getting the value of `pkg_id` in the passed variable. Actually I wasn&#39;t debugging it properly otherwise I did not even have to post it here.  Thanks to Mr. Tim Morton above, I debugged the issue. Strangely, with the same method, I was getting value in `UPDATE` function but not in `DELETE`. I tried some methods to work that out but couldn&#39;t manage.\r\n\r\nSo I used Cookies to solve the problem. The workaround is `Creating Cookie using AJAX and retrieving its value in PHP`. Here is the code I used to do this. I am mentioning only part of code I rewrote.\r\n\r\n***exam_packages.php***\r\n\r\nWrote a function to create cookie right after `$(document).ready(function()`\r\n```\r\nfunction createCookie(name, value, days) \r\n\t{\r\n  \t\tvar expires;\r\n\t\tif (days) \r\n\t\t  {\r\n    \t\tvar date = new Date();\r\n    \t\tdate.setTime(date.getTime() + (days * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));\r\n    \t\texpires = &quot;; expires=&quot; + date.toGMTString();\r\n  \t\t  }\r\n\t\t  else \r\n\t\t  {\r\n    \t\texpires = &quot;&quot;;\r\n  \t\t  }\r\n  \t\tdocument.cookie = escape(name) + &quot;=&quot; + escape(value) + expires + &quot;; path=/&quot;;\r\n\t}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand using it as\r\n\r\n```\r\ncreateCookie(&quot;pkg_id&quot;, $(this).data(&quot;row-id&quot;), &quot;1&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter `var conf = confirm(&#39;Delete No.&#39; + $(this).data(&quot;row-id&quot;) + &#39; package?&#39;);`\r\n\r\nThis creates Cookie named `pkg_id`.\r\n\r\n\r\n***exam_package_resposnse.php***\r\n\r\nAccessed cookie value in this file \r\n\r\n```\r\n$pkg_id = $_COOKIE[&quot;pkg_id&quot;];\r\n```\r\n\r\nand used `pkg_id` as a parameter for my `where` clause.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know this might not be a proper way to solve this but this definitely one of the ways. I tested it and it&#39;s working. If anyone has a better way to do this, please feel free to share as it might be useful to someone else and me too. :)\r\n\r\nRegards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380457/only-delete-option-is-not-working-php-crud/58414097#58414097","title":"only Delete option is not working PHP CRUD"}],"owner":{"reputation":651,"user_id":1662394,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7p637.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mahadev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1662394/mahadev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36861,"user_id":1011527,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/950d56c466691980bba71859798bfe65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jay Blanchard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1011527/jay-blanchard"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":61,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58414097,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571231291,"creation_date":1571069476,"last_edit_date":1571069542,"question_id":58380457,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58380457","body_markdown":"I have been working on basic PHP CRUD.

Here is the code I am using for CRUD operations.\r\n\r\nexam_packages.php\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;

The dataset has been generated by applying filter criteria on a original dateset, which I cannot access. The Features are the filter criteria, that have been applied on the original dataset. This means there is a filter dimension, which says something about the category the data has been filtered for, and one or more multiple filter values. The tricky thing is that the there is no fixed pattern how the filter criteria have been applied, i.e. the number of filter dimensions and filter values differ for different observations.  \r\n\r\nIt is important to note the relationship of the rows: Usually one row means one observations, but here one observation may consist of multiple rows (all rows with the same ID belong to the same observation). \r\nThe aim is to predict whether an observation belongs to a positive or negative class, indicated by the column &#39;target&#39;. \r\n\r\nDo you guys have any advice on how to structure the data? Also, are there any specific Machine Learning algorithms that are suited for this kind of data? \r\n\r\nMy approach so far is to apply One Hot Encoding and use standard ML techniques like Random Forests or Boosting, which is apparently very naive and ignores the relationship of the different rows. \r\n\r\nThanks! \r\nBigBrian\r\n```    \r\n    ID  target Filter_Dimension Filter_Value\r\n0   1       1           Country           US\r\n1   2       0           Country           Mx\r\n2   2       0  Product_Category         Cat1\r\n3   2       0  Product_Category         Cat2\r\n4   3       1           Country           Mx\r\n5   3       1  Product_Category         Cat3\r\n ```\r\nIn my dataset the number of filter dimensions and filter values is huge. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380454/filtered-data-data-structure-and-prediction-algorithm","title":"Filtered Data - Data Structure and Prediction Algorithm"},{"tags":["reactjs","datetime"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8396,"user_id":10959940,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cfe2af4009a4fe0acb46a707c8d5eab3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"wentjun","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10959940/wentjun"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571069977,"creation_date":1571069977,"answer_id":58380599,"question_id":58380453,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58380599","body_markdown":"I am not sure of the exact input or output, but you can make use of [Date.toLocaleDateString][1] to get the desired date string that you need.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const now = new Date();\r\n    const dateString = now.toLocaleDateString({\r\n      weekday: &quot;short&quot;,\r\n      year: &quot;numeric&quot;,\r\n      month: &quot;2-digit&quot;,\r\n      day: &quot;numeric&quot;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    console.log(dateString);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/toLocaleString","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380453/format-date-pulled-from-api-react/58380599#58380599","title":"Format date pulled from API - React"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":12075903,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2901337463228624/picture?type=large","display_name":"Prav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12075903/prav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571073883,"post_id":58380609,"comment_id":103111122,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380453/format-date-pulled-from-api-react/58380609#comment103111122_58380609"},{"owner":{"reputation":174,"user_id":9095807,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/42s36.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Girgetto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9095807/girgetto"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15,"user_id":12075903,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2901337463228624/picture?type=large","display_name":"Prav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12075903/prav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571083561,"post_id":58380609,"comment_id":103114842,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380453/format-date-pulled-from-api-react/58380609#comment103114842_58380609"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":174,"user_id":9095807,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/42s36.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Girgetto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9095807/girgetto"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571070009,"creation_date":1571070009,"answer_id":58380609,"question_id":58380453,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58380609","body_markdown":"You can create a function to return the first part of the date that you need:\r\n \r\n       getDate = (date) =&gt;

Since I don&#39;t want to monkey around with counting and sizing every element I wanted to use the `&lt;section&gt;` HTML element to drop everything into columns.  I know it has to do with how I am cascading height definitions and overrides.

What is lua doing here? Is it always assuming some default LUA_PATH and LUA_CPATH if none are set? Because it works just fine without me specifying any path.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380442/messed-up-lua-paths-after-trying-to-set-up-debugging","title":"messed up lua paths after trying to set up debugging"},{"tags":["botframework","chatbot","luis","azure-bot-service"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571128430,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103127472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103127472_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9156100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xFtR6uFVMTI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEaI/PV7FZpmwrgY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mvedula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9156100/mvedula"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571229338,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103169828,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103169828_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571229455,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103169885,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103169885_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9156100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xFtR6uFVMTI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEaI/PV7FZpmwrgY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mvedula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9156100/mvedula"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571229927,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103170202,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103170202_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571238077,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103175552,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103175552_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9156100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-xFtR6uFVMTI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAEaI/PV7FZpmwrgY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mvedula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9156100/mvedula"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11091,"user_id":3136339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CyHpv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nicolas R","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3136339/nicolas-r"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571255420,"post_id":58380441,"comment_id":103183623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380441/new-custom-intents-added-to-luis-app-are-not-recognized-when-luis-app-is-connect#comment103183623_58380441"},{"owner":{"reputation":3921,"user_id":10860086,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-i6pUDQ6UiYA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAB9Vo/HeFe6tNR68A/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mdrichardson -

You need to adjust your bot code to handle the new intents. You can do this a couple of different ways:\r\n\r\n### 1. Online Editor (not recommended, at all)\r\n\r\nGo to `Azure Portal &gt; Your Resource Group &gt; Your App Service &gt; App Service Editor`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThen edit the files under `wwwroot`. If your bot is in C#, you&#39;ll need to open the console:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThen execute `dotnet build`, then click Run:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n### 2. Local Editor (highly recommended)\r\n\r\nGo to `Azure Portal &gt; Your Resource Group &gt; Your Web App Bot &gt; Build &gt; Download Source Code`:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nThen, open the code in the editor of your choice (I recommend [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) -- both are free), edit the code to account for your new intents, then [Deploy your bot to Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-deploy-az-cli?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&amp;tabs=csharp).\r\n\r\nThis is much, much better in the long-run as you develop your bot.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Update\r\n\r\nWithout actually seeing more of your code, I believe you need to edit your intents into [LuisHelper](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/blob/010532c3477c7ae82ab95f494f395712f0646d93/samples/csharp_dotnetcore/13.core-bot/LuisHelper.cs#L36)\r\n\r\nThat being said, I&#39;m relatively sure this far more advanced that what you&#39;re ready for.

This has two issues: first the data gaps still exist any time the unique x values are used in a math formula such as data$x - min(alldata$x), and second since each resulting dataframe only has a single unique x value I cannot replace it within the loop and have the result be unique for each x value across the entire dataset. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m just starting with loops and I feel as though there&#39;s a different way to iterate across the data to achieve the outcome I require but I haven&#39;t been able to figure it out yet.

```X-Forwarded-For=myservice.com/123456/client```  header to my wildfly (in my filter ```HttpServletRequest.getHeader(&quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot;)``` returns the proper value,

suppose this would be easier in wildfly 18, but I would try to solve this issue without an

have an image which appears upright when you use a browser to navigate to its `URL`, but is rotated 90 degrees when I do something like this `&lt;img id=&#39;img&#39; src=URL&gt;`. I don&#39;t want it to be rotated. Actually, I have a whole list of images, and some are rotated while most aren&#39;t. The URLs don&#39;t give me any clue as to which it&#39;s going to be.\r\n\r\nI understand the issue is something to do with EXIF. I&#39;m not sure if either:\r\n\r\na) The EXIF image rotation property is being accounted for. Therefore I&#39;d want to ignore it using CSS\r\n\r\nor \r\n\r\nb) The EXIF image rotation property is **not** being accounted for. Therefore I&#39;d want to use CSS to tell the browser that it **should** account for it.\r\n\r\nThe best solutions I&#39;ve found use exif-js to check the image rotation property, then based off that CSS to correct the rotation. But unfortunately, I can&#39;t use JS in this example. I need to do it within the &lt;img&gt; tag with the style parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Context: I&#39;m using WiX, a serverless website builder. It lets me set the html of a text element. So I&#39;m taking advantage of that to show images in a more custom way than WiX would normally let me.*\r\n\r\nEdit: Other answers have also mentioned `image-orientation: from-image` but most browsers don&#39;t support this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380433/how-to-ignore-exif-image-orientation-with-css","title":"How to ignore exif image orientation with CSS"},{"tags":["pentaho"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":8446242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9otU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"In0cybe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8446242/in0cybe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571127315,"post_id":58384111,"comment_id":103126876,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380432/use-the-result-of-a-query-as-a-filter-in-another-of-different-db-in-pentaho/58384111#comment103126876_58384111"},{"owner":{"reputation":3303,"user_id":3593498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f46c2d682db4592f696a3d027587d3c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nsousa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3593498/nsousa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":52,"user_id":8446242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9otU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"In0cybe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8446242/in0cybe"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571173116,"post_id":58384111,"comment_id":103150077,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380432/use-the-result-of-a-query-as-a-filter-in-another-of-different-db-in-pentaho/58384111#comment103150077_58384111"},{"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":8446242,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/l9otU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"In0cybe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8446242/in0cybe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571211584,"post_id":58384111,"comment_id":103160149,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380432/use-the-result-of-a-query-as-a-filter-in-another-of-different-db-in-pentaho/58384111#comment103160149_58384111"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3303,"user_id":3593498,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f46c2d682db4592f696a3d027587d3c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nsousa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3593498/nsousa"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571087394,"creation_date":1571087394,"answer_id":58384111,"question_id":58380432,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58384111","body_markdown":"You can pass values from a previous query as parameters using a ?

This way your applications behavior, logic (in the code) and the it&#39;s UI (in XML) are separated. Also, it&#39;s much faster to create layouts in XML.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of using a custom view, it has one text view inside:\r\n\r\n    public class MyRelativeLayout extends RelativeLayout {\r\n     \r\n        private TextView textView;\r\n    \r\n        public MyRelativeLayout(Context context) {\r\n             super(context); \r\n             textView = new TextView(context);\r\n             textView.setText(&quot;Hello&quot;);\r\n             \r\n             //we must use LayoutParams objects to manage layout properties programmatically\r\n              RelativeLayout.LayoutParams params = new RelativeLayout.LayoutParams\r\n                        (ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, ViewGroup.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT);\r\n              params.leftMargin = 5;\r\n              params.rightMargin = 5;\r\n              textView.setLayoutParams(params);\r\n              \r\n              addView(textView); //add to our layout\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    } \r\n\r\nI only added one text view, and set nothing but the side margins, but the code is already long, meanwhile you can do all this in XML as simply as this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;RelativeLayout\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;TextView\r\n                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n                android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n                android:layout_margin=&quot;5dp&quot;\r\n                android:text=&quot;Hello&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd the more complicated the layout gets, the better it is to create it in XML.

reason why only **one** of your buttons works is because of the fact that you are using **ids** to attach a listener to the `click` event. An ID is always a **unique** value. When there is more than one ID with the same value, the first ID is selected and the rest is ignored.\r\n\r\nClasses\r\n---\r\n\r\nInstead use a `class` to identify the buttons or forms. There can be an infinite amount of elements with the same class on the page.\r\n\r\nForm\r\n---\r\nYou are trying to send multiple values at the same time. You can either select each individual `input` element and get their value, or wrap all the `input` fields in a `form` element. This form element can recognize `input` elements inside of it an access their values. It makes it possible to send all of the values in the form at once with more ease.\r\n\r\nMeta\r\n---\r\nRewrite the `meta` element as a hidden `input` element. `meta` elements belong in the `head` of the document to give the browser information about the page that it is looking at.\r\n\r\nSubmit\r\n----\r\nA `form` can be *submitted*, meaning that it will send that data inside of it to the destination that you have set. Change the `input type=&quot;button&quot;` to `input type=&quot;submit&quot;` to use this functionality later on in JS.\r\n\r\nFor this answer I&#39;ve rewritten the `meta` element to an `input`, wrapped the `input` elements in a `form` element and added a `class` to the `form` element. Now you can select **all** forms and listen for the `submit` event.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;pull-right inline&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;form class=&quot;js-downvote-form&quot; action=&quot;/&quot; method=&quot;GET&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;csrf-token&quot; value=&quot;{{ csrf_token() }}&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;negative_vote&quot; value=&quot;{{ Auth::user()-&gt;id }}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;post_id&quot; value=&quot;{{ $post-&gt;id }}&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;btn btn-danger&quot; value=&quot;Downvote&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;/form&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;writeinfo&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nInstead of selecting each individual input, we can select all of them together from the `form` element. With the jQuery [.serialize()](https://api.jquery.com/serialize/) method you can extract all of the values from the form and store it in an object to send in the `body` property.\r\n```\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n\r\n  // Listen to submit instead of click on all forms.\r\n  $(&quot;.js-downvote-form&quot;).on(&quot;submit&quot;, function(event){\r\n \r\n    // Get the values from this form and store it in an object.\r\n    var formData = $(this).serialize();\r\n\r\n    $.ajax({\r\n      /* the route pointing to the post function */\r\n      url: &#39;/negative&#39;,\r\n      type: &#39;POST&#39;,\r\n      /* send the csrf-token and the input to the controller */\r\n      data: formData, // Your data to send.\r\n      dataType: &#39;JSON&#39;,\r\n      /* remind that &#39;data&#39; is the response of the AjaxController */\r\n      success: function (data) { \r\n        $(&quot;.writeinfo&quot;).append(data.alert); \r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // This is important.\r\n    // We want to override the default submit behavior.\r\n    // So preventing it is necessary.\r\n    event.preventDefault();\r\n  });\r\n\r\n});\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380417/only-first-form-is-posted-by-ajax/58380787#58380787","title":"Only first form is posted by AJAX"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":8322043,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18bcdfcd1c35759ab39d4244ed38c822?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mateusz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8322043/mateusz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2339,"user_id":1421957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3b8e742c4a05e312502c828847c455ad?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tico","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1421957/tico"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58380787,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571076204,"creation_date":1571069312,"last_edit_date":1571076204,"question_id":58380417,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58380417","body_markdown":"On my website, I want to have multiple forms for voting on different posts.

This behaviour is not desired since Google doesn&#39;t always provide results with an exact substring match everytime.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\nconsider the search string &quot;dominos sar&quot;\r\n\r\nI get the responses on my server by calling google for following locations:\r\n\r\n&quot;Domino&#39;s Pizza, 10th B Road, Near Children Park, Sardarpura, Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;Domino&#39;s Pizza, Sarada College Road, Fairlands, Salem, Tamil Nadu, India&quot;\r\n\r\nHowever the autocomplete component further filters the search results and therefore I can&#39;t see any data.\r\n\r\nHas anybody faced a similar issue and been able to resolve it?\r\n\r\nPlease do not suggest to use another component or call google directly.

Second of all, I need one of the columns to be sortable so that they still comply with those two properties. \r\n\r\nAs of code, in HTML I&#39;m doing:\r\n\r\n    &lt;table id=&quot;table&quot; class=&quot;table order-list&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;thead class=&quot;thead-dark&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                  &lt;th data-field=&quot;property_1&quot;&gt;Property 1&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                  &lt;th data-field=&quot;property_2&quot; data-sortable=&quot;true&quot;&gt;Property 2&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                  &lt;th data-field=&quot;property_3&quot;&gt;Property 3&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                  &lt;th data-field=&quot;property_4&quot;&gt;Property 4&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                  &lt;th data-field=&quot;property_5&quot;&gt;Property 5&lt;/th&gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n              &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n            &lt;/table&gt;\r\n\r\nIn the javascript I have:\r\n\r\n    var $table = $(&#39;#table&#39;).bootstrapTable({\r\n            method: &#39;get&#39;,\r\n            url: &#39;/api/get_data/&#39;\r\n    });\r\n\r\nSo yeah, everything works fine except for that I don&#39;t know how to implement those two features.\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58380336/bootstrap-table-add-rows-to-divide-the-table","title":"Bootstrap table add rows to divide the table"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8757}
