Before requesting a data read out I write data to the buffer: \r\n```\r\n   if(dataSize == 0) {\r\n       return;\r\n   }\r\n\r\n    bindBuffer(vboIdx);\r\n    if(dataSize &gt; vertexBufSize[vboIdx] - offset) {\r\n        glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, dataSize, data, GL_STREAM_DRAW);\r\n        vertexBufSize[vboIdx] = dataSize;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    void *ptr = glMapBufferRange(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, offset, dataSize, GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT | GL_MAP_UNSYNCHRONIZED_BIT);\r\n    int err = glGetError();\r\n    assert(ptr);\r\n\r\n    if(data != nullptr) {\r\n        memcpy(ptr, data, dataSize);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    glUnmapBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER);\r\n        unbindBuffer();\r\n```\r\nThis is where I call `glBufferData()`\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nJava Side:\r\n```\r\nmView = (GLSurfaceView) frameLayout.findViewById(R.id.plot_view);\r\nmView.setEGLContextClientVersion(3);\r\nmView.setEGLConfigChooser(true);\r\nif(LOG) Log.d(TAG, &quot;onCreateView(): get ID: &quot; + mView.getId());\r\n\r\nisStreaming = true;\r\nmView.setRenderer(new GLSurfaceView.Renderer() {\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onSurfaceCreated(GL10 gl, EGLConfig config) {\r\n  mLiveViewJNI.surfaceCreated();\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onSurfaceChanged(GL10 gl, int width, int height) {\r\n  mLiveViewJNI.surfaceChanged(width, height);\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Override\r\npublic void onDrawFrame(GL10 gl) {\r\n  mLiveViewJNI.drawFrame();\r\n}\r\n\r\n});      \r\n```\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\n@Matic Oblak You were right, the context was actually a problem. As long as I only touched the buffers via JNI within onSurfaceCreated, onSurfaceChanged or onDrawFrame everything was fine. But as soon as I tried to access them outside for instance via mLiveViewJNI.dummyCall I ran into that problem and everything returned 0 or NULL.

In this instance, setTimeout is not appropriate; not only because it will only be called once (setInterval calls at repeating intervals), but also because it&#39;s just not efficient.\r\n\r\nThat means if you checked your checkbox, you have a chance of still waiting almost 5 seconds to get feedback of what you did in the result of an exposed or closed footer.\r\n\r\nInstead, consider the four main ways in which components can bind data between them:\r\n\r\n**Services:**\r\n\r\nYou can construct a service which handles communication between components. Services are injectable, meaning you can inject them into multiple components, and they can be loaded at the root level of the application.\r\n\r\nSimply create a Service and Provide it into your module where you need it.\r\n\r\nThen - create an Observable in your service and Subscribe to that observable in your components that need access to your information. \r\n\r\nRead up more on Observables at : https://angular.io/guide/observables\r\n\r\nIn the above link, there is also an example called Delayed Sequence that may suit your purposes. \r\n\r\n**NgRx:** \r\n\r\nUsing Redux (NgRx) is seen as an advanced method of implementing communication between components, but it is an immutable and reliable source of managing data and data retrieval. \r\n\r\nFor your scenario, if you&#39;re not using it, don&#39;t implement it on this solution alone - however to accomplish it, you would simply dispatch an action when your footer is to be shown or hidden, and then you can subscribe to that data in the store elsewhere. \r\n\r\nRead up more about the store, here: https://ngrx.io/guide/store\r\n\r\n**@Inputs and @Outputs:**\r\n\r\nIf the components are nested, you can handle data between them using Inputs and Outputs. So say for instance you had a &quot;page&quot; component. Well in theory your footer would be inside that, an presumably so would your checkbox be. \r\nSo your checkbox could databind a value &quot;up&quot; to the page component. Which could then bind it &quot;down&quot; to the footer component. \r\n\r\nThis can get messy however, and should be used only if you&#39;re sure the data isn&#39;t also manipulated elsewhere. \r\n\r\nRead more about Inputs and Outputs and general component communication, here: \r\nhttps://angular.io/guide/component-interaction\r\n\r\n\r\n**Event Bus:** \r\n\r\nTechnically you could use an event bus do dispatch a notification to your application to say &quot;display this footer now&quot; - although this may be not be the best approach. \r\n\r\nEvent Bus uses are typically more for notifications purposes, or when you don&#39;t need to know which component has called for the action to happen.\r\n\r\nEssentially an Event Bus is just there to listen for events or circumstances, not track down where or how it came about.  \r\n\r\nRead up more about Event Emmiters in Angular, here: https://angular.io/api/core/EventEmitter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318139/angular-timer-alternatives-or-is-it-the-best-approach/58318444#58318444","title":"Angular timer alternatives or is it the best approach"}],"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":11786942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9358fa29ed0435ed970cc6c78d52018c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"urhen2019","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11786942/urhen2019"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58318444,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570695765,"creation_date":1570694624,"question_id":58318139,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58318139","body_markdown":"I am using Angular 8 at the moment for a project and I have a component with a checkbox that will decide if the footer is visible or not.\r\n\r\nBecause the footer is a separate component to the settings component I currently need to have the footer on a setTimeout checking the a local variable every 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(function(){ checklocalStorage() }, 5000);\r\n\r\nWhen it&#39;s only 1 timer is ok but when I add more of them it just seems a not clean way to do this?\r\n\r\nIs there any other way to do this and have the component update itself without having to have a timer looping all the time to check if anything has changed in the localstorage variable or is this the recommended approach?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318139/angular-timer-alternatives-or-is-it-the-best-approach","title":"Angular timer alternatives or is it the best approach"},{"tags":["django"],"owner":{"reputation":1417,"user_id":11557974,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-UIViiANziWs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/Gig-Qh0_jb0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zaraki Kenpachi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11557974/zaraki-kenpachi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570695701,"creation_date":1570694616,"question_id":58318138,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58318138","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to save filtered QuerySet data into request.session.\r\n\r\nI try do this with pickle but i need to serialize QuerySet before putting data into request.session\r\n\r\nIs there a easy way to save QuerySet object inside session?\r\n\r\nMy attempts:\r\n\r\nwith pickle:\r\n[pickle][1]\r\n\r\nwithout pickle [output is string]:\r\n\r\n    # save data\r\n    product_data = Product.objects.filter(Q(title__icontains=search_sequence))\r\n    product_data = serializers.serialize(&#39;json&#39;,product_data)\r\n    request.session[&#39;product_data&#39;] = product_data\r\n    # recieve data\r\n    if &#39;product_data&#39;

I&#39;m able to get past the login, however when I&#39;m on the welcome screen it freezes and then I&#39;m unable to do anything.\r\n\r\nAfter a reboot, I can then connect successfully again until the connection drops, and then I have to reboot the machine.\r\n\r\nThe Windows version is &quot;Windows 10 Pro N&quot;, build is 10.0.18362.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the upgrade I was able to connect multiple times with no issues.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any ideas what I could look for?\r\n\r\nThanks very much in advance,\r\nDave\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318136/only-able-to-remote-desktop-into-azure-windows-10-only-once","title":"Only able to remote desktop into Azure Windows 10 only once"},{"tags":["laravel","laravel-5","sentry"],"owner":{"reputation":8177,"user_id":1055279,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/13ac92a723e01487c1e6052d2c318353?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"realtebo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1055279/realtebo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570694595,"creation_date":1570694595,"question_id":58318134,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58318134","body_markdown":"We&#39;re using Laravel with Sentry for tracing live exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn some edge cases we&#39;d like to log to sentry (instead of disk only) to track some strange situations, appearing very rarely.\r\n\r\nCan we log something to sentry without throwing exceptions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318134/laravel-sentry-can-we-log-to-sentry-without-throwing-an-exception","title":"Laravel + Sentry : can we log to sentry WITHOUT throwing an exception?"},{"tags":["django","unit-testing","multiple-databases"],"owner":{"reputation":22,"user_id":8990391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8af6ab00586913e6491fbbf59a1a04f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Eduard Grigoryev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8990391/eduard-grigoryev"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570694589,"creation_date":1570694589,"question_id":58318131,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58318131","body_markdown":"How can I test a method (e.g. a serializer) which accesses two databases in Django?

I have been stuck for quite some time now, any help is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks, M","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318078/can-you-make-basic-mainline-dht-queries-like-find-node-and-ping-with-the-libtorr","title":"Can you make basic mainline dht queries like find_node and ping with the libtorrent library"},{"tags":["javascript","printing","oracle-apex"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":232,"user_id":11882693,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/73iR5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arif Sher Khan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11882693/arif-sher-khan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570769501,"creation_date":1570769501,"answer_id":58334429,"question_id":58318074,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58334429","body_markdown":"I am not sure whether this will be possible directly or not.

That&#39;s the purpose. In that session, you can start programs, open documents and do your work. Like you were sitting in front of that machine. The benefit is, this can be done by multiple users, depending only on the number of user licenses and hardware power.\r\n\r\nThere a some special cases, e.g. you can start a program automatically on start up. Then your session is limited to this program and will end, when the program ends. But this is only a restricting. You will still start a session for that.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a small version of Terminal Server build in every windows version, not only servers. This can be used a for a remote connection in the same way.\r\n\r\nSo, sad that, RDP can not connect to a database. In no way. You need a program for that. You can build a local program with a RDP-Client inside. That can connect to a session on a remote machine and start another program, that connects to the database. But you will have no communication between the to programs by default, so there is no benefit.\r\n\r\nI think, like others said, the best is to connect to the database directly.  \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318062/c-connect-winform-app-running-locally-via-remote-desktop-or-other-to-a-databa/58454927#58454927","title":"C# connect WinForm App running locally via Remote Desktop (or other) to a Database"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11394,"user_id":2641576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/K9yqy.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2641576/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571598867,"post_id":58470266,"comment_id":103285554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318062/c-connect-winform-app-running-locally-via-remote-desktop-or-other-to-a-databa/58470266#comment103285554_58470266"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":10895903,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_AZJk_D8VmU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAABU_w/bn-uAP4aeRo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Rechtman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10895903/david-rechtman"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571548803,"creation_date":1571548803,"answer_id":58470266,"question_id":58318062,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58470266","body_markdown":"What you need is to Connect multiple sql users to one database and no to use RDP.\r\n\r\nyou should write a special connection string, for each user something like below:\r\n\r\n    using System.Data.SqlClient;\r\n\r\n    SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection();\r\n    conn.ConnectionString =\r\n        &quot;Data Source=ServerName;&quot; +\r\n        &quot;Initial Catalog=DataBaseName;&quot; +\r\n        &quot;User id=&quot; + UserName + &quot;;&quot;\r\n        &quot;Password=&quot; + Password + &quot;;&quot;;\r\n     conn.Open();\r\n\r\n\r\nPut this in a class that accepts the username and password.\r\n\r\nFull example:\r\n\r\n    class myConnection\r\n    {\r\n        public static SqlConnection GetConnection(string UserName, string Password)\r\n        {\r\n            string str = &quot;Data Source=ServerName;Initial Catalog=DataBaseName;User id=&quot; +             \r\n            UserName + &quot;;Password=&quot; + Password + &quot;;&quot;;\r\n            SQlConnection con = new SqlConnection(str);\r\n            con.Open();\r\n            return con;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen connect each user to DB directly.

Below is the code snippet I am using: \r\n \r\nComponent.ts:\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    export class myComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n      converterForm: FormGroup;\r\n      model: myModel = new MyModel();\r\n\r\n      constructor(private formBuilder: FormBuilder, ) {\r\n        this.myForm = this.formBuilder.group({\r\n          vOne: [this.model.vOne],\r\n          vTwo: [this.model.vTwo],\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n      \r\n      onSubmit(searchInputs) {\r\n        this.model.vTwo= &quot;new&quot;;  //I need to edit the form value and reflect it in html.. two-waybinding\r\n        this.converterForm.value.vOne = &quot;edited&quot;;\r\n        console.log(&quot;Submit called&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nhtml file:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;form [formGroup]=&quot;myForm&quot; (ngSubmit)=&quot;onSubmit(myForm.value)&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div&gt;\r\n              &lt;mat-form-field&gt;\r\n                &lt;input id=&quot;vOne&quot; matInput formControlName=&quot;vOne&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;model.vOne&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;div&gt;\r\n              &lt;mat-form-field&gt;\r\n                &lt;input id=&quot;vTwo&quot; matInput formControlName=&quot;vTwo&quot; [(ngModel)]=&quot;model.vTwo&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;/mat-form-field&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;div&gt;        \r\n            &lt;button mat-raised-button color=&quot;primary&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot; (click)=&quot;search()&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;mat-icon aria-label=&quot;Search icon&quot;&gt;search &lt;/mat-icon&gt;\r\n                Search\r\n              &lt;/button&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nthanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58318056/reactive-form-with-dynamic-data-change-from-component","title":"Reactive form with dynamic data change from component"},{"tags":["java","android","facebook","react-native","instagram"],"owner":{"reputation":6160,"user_id":294089,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/379ae669ce4096c239984ed10f0799c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/294089/roman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570694260,"creation_date":1570694260,"question_id":58318054,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58318054","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to follow Facebook&#39;s docs for [Sharing a Sticker Asset][1] on Android without any luck.

to first question:\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think it&#39;s not the exact response from the server, and there&#39;s a HTML `&lt;br&gt;` tag in the response.\r\n\r\nbecause the line `Value &lt;br of type java.lang.String cannot be...` clearly contains string `&lt;br`, try replacing the HTML tags and/or decoding/unescaping the HTML tags to plain text, AND then you can convert that plain JSON text to *JSONArray*.\r\n\r\nthis snippet might help you out with decoding the response:\r\n\r\n    String parsedReponse = Html.fromHtml(serverResponse).toString()\r\n    if (parsedReponse != null) parsedReponse = parsedReponse.trim();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nAnswer to second question:\r\n---\r\n\r\ncheck out OkHttp3 and Retrofit libraries, they&#39;re pretty popular and

  {\r\n            RegistryKey localMachine = RegistryKey.OpenBaseKey(RegistryHive.LocalMachine,RegistryView.Registry64);\r\n            string productsRoot = @&quot;SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Installer\\UserData\\S-1-5-18\\Products&quot;;\r\n            RegistryKey products = localMachine.OpenSubKey(productsRoot);\r\n            string[] productFolders = products.GetSubKeyNames();\r\n\r\n            foreach (string p in productFolders)\r\n            {\r\n                RegistryKey installProperties = products.OpenSubKey(p +

(string)installProperties.GetValue(&quot;DisplayName&quot;);\r\n                    Debug.WriteLine(displayName);\r\n                    if ((displayName != null) &amp;&amp; (displayName.Contains(productDisplayName)))\r\n                    {\r\n                        string uninstallCommand = (string)installProperties.GetValue(&quot;UninstallString&quot;);\r\n\r\n

However, it should be rather trivial to extend the library to add an additional argument for the progress data shown on the progress bar.\r\n\r\nBasically, you just need to pass two additional values from the Notification Builder by calling the [`SetProgress(int max, int progress, bool intermediate)`][1] method. This is best explained in Google&#39;s Android documentation [here][2].\r\n\r\nThe method were you should add the call to `SetProgress()`&#160;is [`ShowNow()`][3] in the Android specific class */Platform/Droid/NotificationServiceImpl.cs*. Of course you also need to make changes elsewhere so that you can provide the *max* and *progress* values from the cross-platform code.\r\n\r\nIf the above solution seems too complex and you&#39;re not using the plugin extensively, perhaps you can just construct the notifications yourself in the Android project and execute that code using the dependency service.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I removed the Google Books link which doesn&#39;t seem to work for everyone. Instead, [here][4] is an article from Microsoft Docs, detailing how the local notifications can be created. The only additional thing that is missing from the guies is the SetProgress method which is required to show the progress bar.\r\n\r\nAlso, notice that you need to submit the notification again and again to show progress in the progress bar.

Firstly the `Session[&quot;Selected&quot;]` is null on the server side so calling `ToString()` on that is the cause of your error. If you&#39;re using C#6 then you can use the null coalescing operator to return a string instead. If not, then you would need a separate `if` condition.\r\n\r\nSecondly you need to compare the value to an empty string in your client side JS, as `&#39;&#39;` will never equal `null`. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a full example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n      if (&#39;&lt;%= (Session[&quot;Selected&quot;] ?? &quot;&quot;).ToString() %&gt;&#39; === &#39;&#39;) {\r\n        loadTimesheetgrid();\r\n      } else {\r\n        if (&#39;&lt;%= (Session[&quot;Selected&quot;] ?? &quot;&quot;).ToString() %&gt;&#39; === &#39;More Than 60 Hrs&#39;) {\r\n          //call the script you will make for morethan 60 hrs\r\n        } else {\r\n          loadTimesheetgrid();\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    } catch (error) {\r\n      loadTimesheetgrid();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDepdending on your use case you may want to consider providing the session value to the View using a ViewModel, to DRY this up a little.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58317973/how-to-handle-null-session-in-java-script/58318297#58318297","title":"how to handle null session in java script"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":165,"user_id":9869635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6f8c4662a83081b68b5dd67bd4ab1d84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sarthak Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9869635/sarthak-gupta"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570708933,"creation_date":1570708933,"answer_id":58322475,"question_id":58317973,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58322475","body_markdown":"If your session value is null it will fail to convert it while .ToString()\r\nSo better you first check whether it is null or it has some value, if it has then only try to convert it into string.       \r\n\r\n    if (&#39;&lt;%=Session[&quot;Selected&quot;]%&gt;&#39; != null) \r\n         {\r\n                   if (&#39;&lt;%=Session[&quot;Selected&quot;].ToString()%&gt;&#39; == &#39;More Than 60 Hrs&#39;) \r\n                       {\r\n                          //call the script you will make for morethan 60 hrs\r\n                       }\r\n                  else {              \r\n                          loadTimesheetgrid();               \r\n                       }\r\n         }\r\n    else {              \r\n                       loadTimesheetgrid();               \r\n         }\r\nI would suggest you not to place try and catch blocks in your view file as sometimes if it fails it loads partial html elements and you may face some alignment issues.

are many issues with the code that I think were probably generated during your different tests as I can see `INavigationAware` commented out in the base ViewModel but the implementation is still there.\r\n\r\nWhich at this point I guess it&#39;s calling the base Methods instead of the `MerchantPageViewModel`&#39;s. You can put a break point in the base method and see if it passes by there. Probably just by using `override` keyword in your OnNavigatedXXX(..) methods will do it. \r\n\r\nAnyway I would clean it up your code this way:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the base viewModel implementing INavigationAware interface\r\n\r\n        public abstract class AppMapViewModelBase : BindableBase, IDestructible, INavigationAware\r\n\r\n2. remove the  `private readonly INavigationService _navigationService;` from `MerchantPageViewModel` and just pass on the navigtionService to the base constructor\r\n\r\n        public MerchantPageViewModel(INavigationService navigationService) : base(navigationService)\r\n        {\r\n            // _navigationService = navigationService; removed\r\n        }\r\n\r\n3. remove the `INavigationAware` from `MerchantPageViewModel` declaration since it&#39;s already implemented by the base class\r\n\r\n        internal class MerchantPageViewModel : AppMapViewModelBase //, INavigationAware removed\r\n\r\n4. override your methods this way in the `MerchantPageViewModel`:\r\n\r\n        public override void OnNavigatedFrom(INavigationParameters parameters)\r\n        {\r\n            // throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override void OnNavigatedTo(INavigationParameters parameters)\r\n        {\r\n            //throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n            Merchant = parameters.GetValue&lt;Merchant&gt;(&quot;merchant&quot;);\r\n            Debug.WriteLine(Merchant.MerhcnatName);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override void OnNavigatingTo(INavigationParameters parameters)\r\n        {\r\n            // throw new NotImplementedException();\r\n        }\r\n5. If you need to navigate pages from an a child ViewModel, just use `NavigationService` from the base class like that: \r\n\r\n        await NavigationService.NavigateAsync(...);\r\n \r\n\r\nHope it&#39;s clear!\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58317972/inavigationaware-does-not-work-on-xamarin/58318873#58318873","title":"INavigationAware Does not work on Xamarin"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7000686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aac1f6cc175f951eb98e647f79e854f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2596181","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7000686/user2596181"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":7000686,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aac1f6cc175f951eb98e647f79e854f6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user2596181","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7000686/user2596181"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58318873,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570697152,"creation_date":1570693925,"last_edit_date":1570694856,"question_id":58317972,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58317972","body_markdown":"I was playing around with INavigationAware and OnNavigatedFrom,OnNavigatedTo and OnNavigatingTo . \r\n\r\nI have two pages with prism MVVM .

For these purposes, I successfully use a selection tracker and use the isActivated-field to mark selected views.\r\n\r\n    // ListAdapter&lt;..., EntryViewHolder&gt;\r\n\r\n    override fun onBindViewHolder(entryViewHolder: EntryViewHolder, position: Int) {\r\n        /* ... handle content ... */\r\n        val isSelected = /* check SelectionTracker */\r\n        entryViewHolder.bind(isSelected, /* ... */)\r\n    }\t\r\n\t\r\n    inner class EntryViewHolder(itemView: View) : RecyclerView.ViewHolder(itemView) {\r\n        fun bind(isSelected: Boolean) {\r\n            itemView.isActivated = isSelected\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy problem is now concerned with properly styling these elements. First, if an itemView is selected (ie activated), I would like to use the proper theme-based background (no custom color).\r\n\r\nFor this purpose I added my own selector to the itemView with &quot;android:background=&quot;@drawable/background_selector&quot; and set colorControl* as color, but I guess that the colorControl-fields are not fit for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\t&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n\t&lt;selector xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;item android:state_activated=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;color android:color=&quot;?attr/colorControlHighlight&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/item&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;item android:state_activated=&quot;false&quot; android:state_pressed=&quot;false&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;color android:color=&quot;@android:color/transparent&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/item&gt;\r\n\r\n\t\t&lt;item android:state_activated=&quot;false&quot; android:state_pressed=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n\t\t\t&lt;color android:color=&quot;?attr/colorControlActivated&quot;/&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;/item&gt;\r\n\t&lt;/selector&gt;\r\n\r\nNow my questions: \r\n\r\n* Which color or drawable should I use as background for these various states so that I can simply use a predefined theme? Eg which theme/style-entry is used by ListView by default?\r\n* To obtain a ribbon-effect, how can I use ?attr/selectableItemBackground (no need to support phones &lt; Android 7 or so) within my selector and still highlight selected items?\r\n\r\nAnd a combination of these questions:\r\n\r\n* Can I get rid of my own selector and in my itemView use \r\n\r\n    android:background=&quot;?attr/selectableItemBackground&quot;\r\n\r\nand set some property to use the proper selected/activated-background within the android resources? (I know that I could do this in my viewHolder, but there should be another way purely using xml-style attributes?)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58317959/recyclerview-theme-based-selection-background-and-ribbon-effect","title":"RecyclerView theme-based selection background and ribbon effect"},{"tags":["swift","visual-studio-code","sourcekit","sourcekitservice"],"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":331244,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfb6deb8bd2e1cfc7e0fa72cc1faa508?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user331244","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/331244/user331244"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16248,"user_id":2631715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/25382df099e692f409929ce3bf4e9961?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gama11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2631715/gama11"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570705409,"creation_date":1570693865,"last_edit_date":1570705409,"question_id":58317956,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58317956","body_markdown":"I decided to try out VSCode for Swift development with [Swift Development environment][1] extension.
