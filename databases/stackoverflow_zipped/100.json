This data is then drawn to the screen using my draw() function, etc.\r\n\r\nThe looping part is using Tkinters after function that calls a specific function after n milliseconds. I have a feeling that when calling destroy or just closing the window, this loop halts? Causing some back-end process to not be satisfied.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve posted the code below, as you&#39;ll be missing the abstract class. Removing the (Updater) and the super within __init__ will satisfy it, as the abstract class is more so like an interface.\r\n\r\n**Replicating the issue:** During run-time of the script, if the Tkinter window is closed by any means available before plotting all the data from the queue onto the plot. The script never returns to command line and is forever stuck. This situation is unfavorable as being able to exit the window and expect the process to be destroyed is what I&#39;m seeking. \r\n\r\n**Further tracking:** Upon failing to pass oscy.run(), the program promptly exits but doesn&#39;t return to the command line; as it&#39;s seen by running and swiftly exiting the program before completion.

If the person forgot to previously check in, then it will create a new record with just the check out timestamp and the ID/Area.\r\n\r\nI thought that trying to find the user by matching both ID AND Area would be better since the same person can check in/out of different areas several times a day so matching only by ID could generate the problem of the program updating the wrong field at one point.\r\n\r\n\r\n**models.py**\r\n```\r\nclass WorkArea(models.Model):\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return self.name\r\n\r\n\r\nclass StationNumber(models.Model):\r\n    work_area = models.ForeignKey(WorkArea, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return self.name\r\n\r\n\r\nclass EmployeeWorkAreaLog(TimeStampedModel, SoftDeleteModel, models.Model):\r\n    employee_number = models.IntegerField(max_length=50, help_text=&quot;Employee #&quot;, blank=False)\r\n    work_area = models.ForeignKey(WorkArea, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=False, help_text=&quot;Work Area&quot;, related_name=&quot;work_area&quot;)\r\n    station_number = models.ForeignKey(StationNumber, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, help_text=&quot;Station&quot;, related_name=&quot;stations&quot;, blank=True)\r\n    time_in = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True, help_text=&quot;Time in&quot;, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    time_out = models.DateTimeField(blank=True, help_text=&quot;Time out&quot;, null=True)\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return self.employee_number\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n**forms.py**\r\n```\r\nclass EnterExitArea(CreateView):\r\n    model = EmployeeWorkAreaLog\r\n    template_name = &quot;operations/enter_exit_area.html&quot;\r\n    form_class = WarehouseForm\r\n\r\n    def form_valid(self, form):\r\n        form.save()\r\n        return HttpResponseRedirect(self.request.path_info)\r\n\r\n\r\ndef load_stations(request):\r\n    work_area_id = request.GET.get(&#39;work_area&#39;)\r\n    stations = StationNumber.objects.filter(work_area_id=work_area_id).order_by(&#39;name&#39;)\r\n    return render(request, &#39;operations/station_number_dropdown_options.html&#39;, {&#39;stations&#39;: stations})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess my question is more towards, how could I go about implementing something like this? \r\n\r\nAnd, currently the check in automatically saves the timestamp upon submit, but it shouldn&#39;t change it when the check out area button in pressed because it would defeat it&#39;s purpose.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510273/how-to-create-a-check-in-check-out-system-with-timestamps","title":"How to create a &quot;check-in/check-out&quot; system with timestamps?"},{"tags":["ruby","routes","sinatra","rack"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3986,"user_id":3784008,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/55ou4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"anothermh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3784008/anothermh"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571772907,"post_id":58510271,"comment_id":103349874,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510271/why-does-using-a-sinatra-route-order-gave-me-different-results-when-i-change-rou#comment103349874_58510271"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10537337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_Gq8YwmH2y4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbDzmNqsHgkPYibrFtCGKqN6iwUHLg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pablo Blanco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10537337/pablo-blanco"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571768617,"creation_date":1571768617,"question_id":58510271,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58510271","body_markdown":"With this app, when i execute then response depends on route order.\r\n\r\n`app.rb`\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ProductsController &lt; Sinatra::Base\r\n  \r\n  get &#39;/products/:id/presentation/:presentation_id&#39; do\r\n    puts &quot;/products/:id/presentation/params: #{params[:id]}, #{params[:presentation_id]}&quot;\r\n  end\r\n  \r\n  get &#39;/products/:id/presentation/new&#39; do\r\n    puts &quot;/products/:id/presentation/new params: #{params[:id]}&quot;\r\n  end\r\n\r\nend\r\n\r\n```\r\nRequests\r\n```\r\ncurl localhost:9292/products/1/presentation/1\r\ncurl localhost:9292/products/1/presentation/new\r\n```\r\nResponses \r\n```\r\nCONTROLLER_1 params: 1, 1\r\n127.0.0.1 - - [22/Oct/2019:14:55:21 -0300] &quot;GET /products/1/presentation/1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 - 0.0039\r\nCONTROLLER_1 params: 1, new\r\n127.0.0.1 - - [22/Oct/2019:15:00:58 -0300] &quot;GET /products/1/presentation/new HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 - 0.0005\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf i change(swap) Route orders i get another result\r\n\r\n`app.rb` \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ProductsController &lt; Sinatra::Base\r\n    \r\n  get &#39;/products/:id/presentation/new&#39; do\r\n    puts &quot;CONTROLLER_2 params: #{params[:id]}&quot;\r\n  end\r\n\r\n  get &#39;/products/:id/presentation/:presentation_id&#39; do\r\n    puts &quot;CONTROLLER_1 params: #{params[:id]}, #{params[:presentation_id]}&quot;\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nRequests\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl localhost:9292/products/1/presentation/1\r\ncurl localhost:9292/products/1/presentation/new\r\n```\r\nResponses \r\n```\r\nCONTROLLER_1 params: 1, 1\r\n127.0.0.1 - - [22/Oct/2019:15:06:06 -0300] &quot;GET /products/1/presentation/1 HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 - 0.0042\r\nCONTROLLER_2 params: 1\r\n127.0.0.1 - - [22/Oct/2019:15:06:10 -0300] &quot;GET /products/1/presentation/new HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 - 0.0014\r\n```\r\nWhat is the problem?

am seeing that your `.c` files are not being built when you compile using the CMake-generated Makefile; this is *causing* the link errors.

Basically you wrap it around whatever is going to be clicked (i.e. the submit button) And before it submit&#39;s anything the component will render a popup. You can populate the popup with &quot;Your price is...&quot; and calculate the final price. Then pass the props `onConfirm={YOUR_SUBMIT_FUNCTION} onCancel={()=&gt;{this.setState({totalPrice: null})}}`\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codesandbox.io/s/great-zhukovsky-kt5qf\r\n  [2]:

have an order form that currently takes a users input and posts it into a dynamo db table on submit.\r\n\r\nRight now, that&#39;s all the &quot;submit&quot; button does.\r\n\r\nI want the on click to instead calculate a price based off of the users input, hide the form, display the price with an &quot;accept and schedule&quot; button, that then posts to dynamo db.\r\n\r\n          -----------------I am very new to to react js so I apologize if my code is sloppy. -------------------\r\nI figured that my function to handle the calculation would look something like the following,

function that calculates a price based off of the users input, hide the form, display the price with an &quot;accept and schedule&quot; button, and then posts to dynamo db?\r\n\r\nIf anyone could share either some resources or insight on how I should go about executing this, that would be extremely appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nImages of calculation debugger:\r\n\r\n[property sqft is

It that out that my project&#39;s build is unable to explicitly load one DLL (out of many) that contains a wxWidgets GUI element during runtime without incremental linking (/INCREMENTAL) enabled.\r\n\r\nTo give a little context, I have the following targets built by my project:\r\n\r\n- main.exe\r\n- core.dll\r\n- foo.dll\r\n- bar.dll\r\n\r\ncore.dll contains general functions that are used by all other projects. main.exe is a desktop GUI application (using wxWidgets) that explicitly loads foo.dll and bar.dll at runtime via &quot;LoadLibraryW&quot;. &quot;GetProcAddress&quot; is then used to request GUI elements from within the DLLs to be displayed, which is all done asynchronously via wxEvent. This has worked as intended for the most part. However, I have found that an issue arises when the main.exe is not incrementally linked.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, when main.exe is not linked with a core.dll that was linked with /INCREMENTAL, and when my project is implicitly linked to the release build of wxWidgets (which is not incrementally linked), foo.dll crashes at runtime on allocation of a new wxPropertyGrid, or wxPropertyGridManager (have tried both). The exception is thrown within &quot;wxmsw30u_propgrid_vc_x64_custom.dll&quot;, which is clearly the property grid DLL. Since the debug version of wxWidgets is incrementally linked and does not crash, I was unable to get further information than this.\r\n\r\n**That is to say, when using the Release DLL version of wxWidgets, my project works if and only if a core.dll is linked with /INCREMENTAL and then linked into main.exe, regardless of whether or not main.exe is linked incrementally. foo.dll can be linked with a core.dll that was linked with /INCREMENTAL:NO and still be opened correctly by main.exe so long as that condition is satisfied. There are no problems with the Debug DLL version of wxWidgets, which is built with /INCREMENTAL.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat summarizes my specific problem. Since the actual code spans several files long, I&#39;ve decided to reduce this question to the fundamental problem: how could incremental linking enable what I presume to be a faulty build to run successfully? I&#39;d like some insight into this question in particular since it is truly baffling to me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Specifically, I am using wxWidgets-3.0.4 on Visual Studio 2019 targeting the latest Windows 10 SDK. The machine architecture is x64. I am building the project with CMake and have experienced no such issues on Linux when linking with g++-6.3.0 and using dllopen in place of

While you can mock a DbContext, it&#39;s not pretty by any stretch and mocking a repository call is a lot simpler.  I consider a generic repository pattern however, as an anti-pattern. They either end up anemic, doing nothing of any benefit, or overly complex trying to abstract away EF-isms from calling code. You also end up stacking up a significant number of repository dependencies in your controllers/services just to get anything non-trivial done.\r\n\r\nFor instance if I have a CreateOrderController to service a order creation screen, I will want to be able to create orders, orderlines, and provide lists of products as well as associate customers. With generic repositories:\r\n\r\n    public CreateOrderController(IUnitOfWorkFactory unitOfWorkFactory, \r\n       IOrderRepository orderRepository,  \r\n       IOrderLineRepository orderLineRepository, \r\n       IProductRepository productRepository, \r\n       ICustomerRepository customerRepository)\r\n    {  /* ... */ }\r\n\r\nWhere each repository is a `Repository&lt;T&gt;` and I try to leverage generic methods. Invariably I&#39;m going to have methods that are specific to an Order, or other entity which will deviate from the common generic flavour. I&#39;m also going to potentially compromise on returning details that I don&#39;t need. For instance if it was a ManageOrderController and I want to know if any of the order lines contain a product:\r\nEither I have a specific method in the OrderLineRepository:\r\n\r\n    bool HasOrderLineWithProduct(int orderId, int productId);\r\n\r\n... and my repository is littered with methods like this for every scenario, or my controller code is littered with use of inefficient &quot;generic&quot; methods like:\r\n\r\n    var orderLines = _orderLineRepository.GetOrderLinesForOrder(orderId);\r\n    var hasProduct = orderLines.Any(x =&gt; x.ProductId == productId);\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that my repository has loaded all order lines for that order to memory just so I could perform an exists check with further criteria against them. It&#39;s not ideal.\r\n\r\nAs David points out, to leverage a repository with EF, you should embrace IQueryable and a unit of work pattern to manage the lifetime scope of your DbContext. Worst case the DbContext can be scoped to the web request and injected into your controllers, services, and repositories. I prefer to use explicit scoping though so that it is crystal clear who is responsible for committing the unit of work. With IQueryable, the business logic can manage the scope, and determine how it wants to consume the data rather than either presenting a lot of similar methods in the repository, or a lot of conditional complexity.\r\n\r\nFor the above example for a CreateOrderController, I would have something that looks more like:\r\n\r\n    public CreateOrderController(IUnitOfWorkFactory unitOfWorkFactory,,\r\n         ICreateOrderRepository createOrderRepository)\r\n    {  /* ... */ }\r\n\r\n... where the repository serves this controller. Simpler to set up test mocks. Where I need to retrieve a customer, or product references, the repository can serve those:\r\n\r\n    IQueryable&lt;Customer&gt; GetCustomerById(int customerId);\r\n    IQueryable&lt;Product&gt; GetAllProducts();\r\n\r\nWhy `IQueryable` when I just expect one customer? Because that gives my consuming code full control over how that code is consumed. I might want the single entity, or I might want to do an exists check (`.Any()`) or select just a subset of detail about them. The same goes for fetching the products. Chances are I want to populate a simple list of view models with the product ID and name for the create UI to select from. The repository implementation enforces base-level rules such as authentication/authorization checks, and stuff like IsActive checks to return just active data in soft-delete scenarios. \r\n\r\nIn the above case where I have a controller (and repository) that I want to check for the existance of OrderLines for a given product:\r\n\r\n    var hasProduct = manageOrderRepository.GetOrderById(orderId).SelectMany(o =&gt; o.OrderLines).Any(ol =&gt; ol.Product.ProductId == productId);\r\n\r\nBy returning an `IQueryable`, consuming code can leverage Linq to do whatever it needs. GetOrderById can be mocked out for testing purposes to return a stub entity with relevant details for a test, an empty list, etc. We don&#39;t need dozens of scenario-based methods, or perform expensive queries. There are no complex expression tree arguments in the repository to provide dynamic filtering, sorting, or pagination. Linq and `IQueryable` already provide that. It doesn&#39;t &quot;leak&quot; EF-isms any more than complex expressions would since any expressions and such passed into a repository would still need to conform to EF&#39;s rules. The result is the ability to leverage strictly efficient queries.\r\n\r\nThe repository also serves as a factory for new entities. When I go to create a new Order, I don&#39;t leave that up to my controller/service to:\r\n\r\n    var newOrder = new Order();\r\n    // populate order lines.\r\n    context.Orders.Add(newOrder);\r\n    context.SaveChanges();\r\n\r\ninstead, my repository exposes a CreateOrder method:\r\n\r\n    Order CreateOrder(string OrderNumber, Customer customer, IEnumerable&lt;Product&gt; products);\r\n\r\nThat might be a CustomerId and set of ProductIds instead, depending on how I structure the system...  In either case the repository validates that the required information is present then creates the order entity, associates these required details, and adds it to the DbSet and returns it. Anything that is non-nullable will be required in the factory method. This ensures that any created entity is always in a minimum viable valid state. Any optional details can be set on the returned order before the controller/service calls SaveChanges on the unit of work. A factory could be considered a separate concern and a separate class, but I give this responsibility to the repository since it has all of the access needed to perform this duty.\r\n\r\nThere are trade-offs with any approach around repositories like this. Some people will state &quot;what about DRY?! (Don&#39;t Repeat Yourself)&quot; given that multiple repositories can, and will be querying the same entities. This is absolutely true, however I personally believe KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) trumps DRY, and that leveraging a repository to serve a controller or service better satisfies SRP. (Single Responsibility Principle) When you split off repositories per entity to satisfy DRY, your repository now has more than one reason to change. To try and re-use code, those methods now get called by different areas that can, and often do have different needs. DRY is an optimization step, and should apply to &quot;identical&quot; not merely &quot;similar&quot; code and concerns. When I re-factor a CreateOrderRepository or ManageOrderRepository, it is only for that one purpose. I don&#39;t need to worry about possible side-effects from optimizations that might impact other areas or break other tests. Generally, any duplication between repositories will be on read-type querying which is pretty simple stuff.

Either add an `index.js` file within your `./components` directory containing the necessary code for said component or double check that your path is correct for said import, i.e.: \r\n\r\n    import Component from &#39;./components&#39;&lt;COMPONENT&gt;;\r\n\r\nwhere `&lt;COMPONENT&gt;` is the name of the component you meant to import.\r\n\r\n\r\nHopefully that helps!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510177/uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpected-token-reactjs-mainchunk-js/58510309#58510309","title":"Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token &#39;!&#39;

I have managed to get the Ninite stuff working fine but Chocolatey is proving to be a pain. \r\n\r\nThis section of the code is supposed to compare the app versions from my `.csv` to data returned from querying chocolatey via cmd.exe.\r\n\r\nIf the versions don&#39;t match I have some other classes that deal with updating the `.csv` with the latest available version and the rest of the code creates some config files to be used by the other software I am dealing with. This bit is irrelevant as I have managed to get it to work. It&#39;s simply just the fact that for some unknown reason the strings returned from querying chocolatey are not behaving as they should.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI initially thought the issue may have been caused by the way I was using `.Replace()` to filter unwanted data but at this point if I remove all instances of `.Replace()` and just simply use the data stored in line I get the same results.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to lay somewhere in the `GetChocApps()` method and the print outs are from the `CompareVersions()` method. \r\n\r\n(Sorry if I have provided a tad more code than I should have but I personally thought it was all relevant)\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Diagnostics;\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\nnamespace XXXX_PackagingAutomation\r\n{\r\n    class Choc\r\n    {\r\n        private Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;

Something like this algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. Find set LT less than min extent\r\n2. Find set GT greater than max extent\r\n3. Compute new shrunken window to allow for timestamps on the left (min) or right (max) extents\r\n4. Find set N between min and max\r\n\r\n5. Construct band scale for set LT\r\n6.

need to reformat your code a little bit, something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (const target of targets) {\r\n    if (target.messagePayload) return target;\r\n\r\n    const textMessage = {\r\n        body: target.plainMsg,\r\n        to: target.targetNumber,  // Text to this number\r\n        from: twilioNumber, // From a valid Twilio number\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    let payloadMessage;\r\n    try {\r\n        payloadMessage  = await client.messages.create(textMessage);\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n        console.warn(&#39;ocurrio un error al enviar mensaje&#39;, err)\r\n        target.messageError = err;\r\n        // continue;  // Remove this line to continue the execution of finally block\r\n    } finally {\r\n        if (payloadMessage) {\r\n            countSeg = countSeg + parseInt(payloadMessage.numSegments);\r\n            target.messagePayload = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(new MessagePayload(payloadMessage)));\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        await admin.firestore().collection(`/targets`).doc(target.id).set(target);\r\n        await timeout(100);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\nIn this way you can get rid of the &quot;old&quot; `then` syntax, because `async - await` lets you to put your `await` code inside a `try - catch` block to intercept the errors from the `await` call, and everything else after will be executed in case of success.\r\n\r\nAlso use `continue` to instead of `return null`.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can get rid of the conditional block `if (payloadMessage)` because `try - catch` ensures that your variable has a value, but idk for sure.\r\n\r\nSpecs here :

Hence what you see above. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58505218/in-node-mongodb-unit-test-document-isnt-created-saved-in-time-for-test-analysi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510110/order-of-operations-in-before-and-describe-blocks-in-mocha-chai-node-tests","title":"Order of Operations in `before` and `describe` blocks in Mocha/Chai Node Tests"},{"tags":["amazon-s3"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":5316634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ruq3cEppNDE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEw/0ZBLcitr7bg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"aleks.lector","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5316634/aleks-lector"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571769480,"creation_date":1571769480,"answer_id":58510464,"question_id":58510108,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58510464","body_markdown":"You can use `s3cmd sync -r` for recursive syncing your folders.

However it does not return any ```name``` more than once, so I only get as many rows are there are distinct entries in the top_scorer column. The resulting values are also sorted alphabetically rather than in the order they&#39;re first found.\r\n\r\nSo rather than\r\n\r\n```\r\ntop_scorer\r\n----------\r\nname1\r\nname1\r\nname4\r\nname2\r\nname4\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe code above returns\r\n\r\n```\r\ntop_scorer\r\n----------\r\nname1\r\nname2\r\nname4\r\n``` \r\n\r\nI also tried:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSELECT name AS top_scorer FROM table\r\nWHERE A = MAX(A)\r\nUNION\r\nSELECT name AS top_scorer FROM table\r\nWHERE B = MAX(B)\r\nUNION\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this gave an error: &quot;misuse of aggregate function MAX()&quot;\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a query that would return the ```top_scorers``` table above?\r\n\r\nSimilar questions I&#39;ve found are either looking to return maximums from one column using ```GROUP BY```, or the maximum value across a range of columns for each row  (equivalent to the highest score achieved by each ```name``` in this case), which aren&#39;t what I&#39;m looking for.\r\n\r\nIs there maybe something clever that can be done with ```PIVOT``` or some other transposing function? I&#39;m a SQL beginner and haven&#39;t tried using anything like that before.\r\n\r\nThis is running on DB Browser for SQLite.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510103/how-can-i-select-an-id-from-the-row-with-the-maximum-value-for-each-of-several-c","title":"How can I select an ID from the row with the maximum value for each of several columns?"},{"tags":["php","mysql","flutter"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25566,"user_id":666221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9iw4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"diegoveloper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/666221/diegoveloper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571768085,"post_id":58510101,"comment_id":103347938,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510101/flutter-unhandled-exception-formatexception-unexpected-character-at-character#comment103347938_58510101"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10784125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b32cba98b393d43969fc6de6f9e48286?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10784125/smith"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":25566,"user_id":666221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9iw4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"diegoveloper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/666221/diegoveloper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571768449,"post_id":58510101,"comment_id":103348093,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510101/flutter-unhandled-exception-formatexception-unexpected-character-at-character#comment103348093_58510101"},{"owner":{"reputation":25566,"user_id":666221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Q9iw4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"diegoveloper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/666221/diegoveloper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571768478,"post_id":58510101,"comment_id":103348107,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510101/flutter-unhandled-exception-formatexception-unexpected-character-at-character#comment103348107_58510101"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10784125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b32cba98b393d43969fc6de6f9e48286?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10784125/smith"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571768660,"creation_date":1571768660,"answer_id":58510280,"question_id":58510101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58510280","body_markdown":"Thanks, for answer to diegoveloper! \r\nI just change: print(response.body.toString()); And error not showing!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510101/flutter-unhandled-exception-formatexception-unexpected-character-at-character/58510280#58510280","title":"Flutter Unhandled Exception: FormatException: Unexpected character (at character 4)"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10784125,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b32cba98b393d43969fc6de6f9e48286?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Smith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10784125/smith"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571768660,"creation_date":1571767854,"question_id":58510101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58510101","body_markdown":"I try to receive data from MySQL database.

The best recommendation I have is to [install Xdebug](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=xdebug+laravel) and add a breakpoint in place of your `dump(&#39;debug&#39;)` line. This will tell you what stack trace has occurred to reach, and can help you trace back to why the translations are being loaded when you aren&#39;t expecting.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to use [short key translations](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/localization#using-short-keys), which are namespaced and loaded independently instead of as a whole and combined.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58510082/laravel-5-loadjsontranslationsfrom-method-does-not-load-all-json-translation-fil/58510679#58510679","title":"Laravel 5

splitted the logic of my application in multiple packages, and each one encapsulates it&#39;s own files (views, controllers, models, resources, migrations); everything is working fine, but, I&#39;m having problems with the translations.\r\n\r\nIn the AppServiceProvider of each package I&#39;m calling the function `loadJsonTranslationsFrom` and passing the path where the JSON translation file is located, like `$this-&gt;loadJsonTranslationsFrom(__DIR__ . &#39;/../../resources/lang&#39;)`.\r\n\r\nThis method works fine after loading the JSON translation file from the main project and one of the packages, but before that the function fails to load the rest of the files.\r\n\r\nAfter a lot of search, I decided to debug the framework files by hand, then I modified the file `vendor/laravel/framework/src/Illuminate/Translation/FileLoader.php` in the following way:\r\n\r\nIn the function `addJsonPath($path)` (line 174), I added `dump($this)` to print the current state of the loader instance, after the line `$this-&gt;jsonPaths[] = $path` (line 176):\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Add a new JSON path to the loader.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  string  $path\r\n     * @return void\r\n     */\r\n    public function addJsonPath($path)\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;jsonPaths[] = $path;\r\n        dump($this);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the function `loadJsonPaths($locale)` (line 139), I added `dump(&#39;debug&#39;)` to check when this line is called, after the very beginning of the function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    /**\r\n     * Load a locale from the given JSON file path.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param  string  $locale\r\n     * @return array\r\n     *\r\n     * @throws \\RuntimeException\r\n     */\r\n    protected function loadJsonPaths($locale)\r\n    {\r\n        dump(&#39;debug&#39;);\r\n        return collect(array_merge($this-&gt;jsonPaths, [$this-&gt;path]))\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter that changes I found that the function `loadJsonPaths` is called before the other packages  have loaded their respective translation files, this is the output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFileLoader {#164 ▼\r\n  #files: Filesystem {#156}\r\n  #path:
