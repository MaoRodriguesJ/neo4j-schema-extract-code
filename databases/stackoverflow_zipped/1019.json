of the questions will become clear once you understand how row level security is implemented: the conditions in the policies will automatically be added to the query, just as if you added another `WHERE` condition.\r\n\r\nUse `EXPLAIN` to see the query plan, and you will see the policy&#39;s conditions in there.\r\n\r\n- So you can use any columns from the table on which the policy is defined.\r\n\r\n  Essentially, you can use anything in a policy definition that you could use in a `WHERE` conditions: Function calls, subqueries and so on.\r\n\r\n  You can also qualify the column name with the table name if that is required for disambiguation. This can be used in the policy from your example: The unqualified `name` is interpreted as `owners.name`, so the test always succeeds. To fix the policy, use `locations.name` instead of `name`.\r\n\r\n- There is no magic `user_name` variable, and I don&#39;t know where you get that from. There is, however, the `current_user` function, which is always available and can of course also be used in a policy definition.\r\n\r\n- `WITH CHECK` is a condition that the new row added by `INSERT` or `UPDATE` must fulfill.

Unfortunately the documentation is not very verbose on the matter. My problem is the following:\r\n\r\nI have two tables: `locations` and `locations_owners`. There is a `TRIGGER` set on `INSERT` for locations, which will automatically add a new row to the `locations_owners` table including the `request.jwt.claim.sub` [variable][1].\r\n\r\nThis works all just fine, however when I want to create a policy for `DELETE` like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE POLICY location_delete ON eventzimmer.locations FOR DELETE TO organizer USING(\r\n    (SELECT EXISTS (SELECT name FROM protected.locations_owners AS owners WHERE owners.name = name AND owners.sub = (SELECT current_setting(&#39;request.jwt.claim.sub&#39;, true))))\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will always evaluate to true, no matter the actual content. I know that I can call a custom procedure with `SELECT` here, however I ended up with the following questions:\r\n\r\n- what is the scope of a `policy`? Can I access tables? Can I access procedures? The documentation says _&quot;Any SQL conditional expression&quot;_ so `SELECT EXISTS` should be fine\r\n- how are the column names of the rows mapped to the policy. The examples just magically use the column names (which I adopted by using the `name` variable), however I have not found **any** documentation about what this actually does\r\n- what is the magic `user_name` variable. Where does it come from? I believe it is the current `role` which is executing the query, but how can I know?\r\n- why is there no `WITH CHECK` expression available for `DELETE`? If I understand correctly, `WITH CHECK` will `fail` any row with invalid constraint, which is the behaviour I would prefer (because otherwise PostgREST will always return `204`)\r\n\r\nI am a little bit confused by the astonishingly missing amount of information in the (otherwise) very good documentation of PostgreSQL. Where is this information? How can I find it?\r\n\r\nFor the sake of completeness I have also attached the column definitions below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE eventzimmer.locations (\r\n  name varchar PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,\r\n  latitude float NOT NULL,\r\n  longitude float NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS protected.locations_owners (\r\n    name varchar NOT NULL REFERENCES eventzimmer.locations(name) ON DELETE CASCADE,\r\n    sub varchar NOT NULL\r\n);\r\n``` \r\n\r\n  [1]: http://postgrest.org/en/v6.0/api.html#accessing-request-headers-cookies-and-jwt-claims","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300183/what-is-the-scope-of-postgres-policies","title":"What is the scope of Postgres policies?"},{"tags":["javascript","php","jquery","html","magento2"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9626545,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-vj_ycptiwJc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpI/RCbCEiRFr4Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sergey Kusch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9626545/sergey-kusch"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570625795,"creation_date":1570625795,"answer_id":58304668,"question_id":58300179,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58304668","body_markdown":"```\r\n  protected function _prepareForm()\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        $model = $this-&gt;ruleFactory-&gt;create();\r\n        // $model = $this-&gt;ruleModelFactory-&gt;create();\r\n\r\n        $id = $this-&gt;_request-&gt;getParam(&#39;uniq_id&#39;);\r\n        $name = $this-&gt;_request-&gt;getParam(&#39;name&#39;);\r\n        $cuttedName = trim(str_replace(&#39;parameters&#39;, &#39;&#39;, $name), &#39;[]&#39;);\r\n//        if ($this-&gt;ruleResourceCollection-&gt;getSize() == 0) {\r\n//\r\n//        } else {\r\n//            if (!$id) {\r\n//                $model = $this-&gt;ruleResourceCollection\r\n//                    -&gt;addFieldToFilter(\\MonteShot\\MegaWidget\\Model\\Rule::UNIQ_BUTTON_ID,\r\n//                        $id\r\n//                    )-&gt;load();\r\n//            }\r\n//        }\r\n\r\n        /** @var \\Magento\\Framework\\Data\\Form $form */\r\n        $form = $this-&gt;_formFactory-&gt;create(\r\n            [\r\n                &#39;data&#39;

into [angular life cycle hooks][1]. You are trying to to access `tabValeurs` in `OnInit` life cycle. Here `tabValeurs` is not populated yet. You can use `OnChanges` to look for changes in your inputs and do something based on that.\r\n\r\n**Minimum Example:**\r\n\r\n    import { Component, Input, OnChanges, SimpleChanges } from &#39;@angular/core&#39;;\r\n\r\n    @Component({\r\n        selector: &#39;my-app&#39;,\r\n        templateUrl: &#39;./app.component.html&#39;,\r\n        styleUrls: [&#39;./app.component.css&#39;]\r\n    })\r\n    export class AppComponent implements OnChanges {\r\n        @Input() tabValeurs: any[] = [];\r\n\r\n        ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {\r\n            if (changes.tabValeurs) {\r\n                //do something\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd it is a good idea to initialize `@Input` type array variables as empty array when declaring. That way you can avoid null checks in `html`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300169/empty-array-when-passing-it-into-a-component-input/58300406#58300406","title":"Empty array when passing it into a component (Input)"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":9144506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1550077465084036/picture?type=large","display_name":"Bastien Roussel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9144506/bastien-roussel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570613590,"post_id":58300431,"comment_id":102964842,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300169/empty-array-when-passing-it-into-a-component-input/58300431#comment102964842_58300431"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":7091523,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GfD6KkC_Gls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAs/8CZIxLKwDkM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eslam Mahgoub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7091523/eslam-mahgoub"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570611281,"creation_date":1570611281,"answer_id":58300431,"question_id":58300169,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58300431","body_markdown":"the bindings are only updated when there is a change detection.

A waypoint is defined by its center coordinates (x, y) and its radius r. The shortest path have to intersect each waypoint circumference **at least once**. This is different from other path optimization problems because I already know the **order** in which the waypoints have to be crossed.\r\n\r\nIn the [simple case][1], consecutive waypoints are distinct and not aligned and this can be solved using consecutive angle bisections. The tricky cases are :  \r\n\r\n* [when three or more consecutive waypoints have the same center but different radii][3]\r\n* [when consecutive waypoints are aligned such that a straight line passes through all of them][2]\r\n\r\nHere is a stripped down version of my Python implementation, which does not handle aligned waypoints, and handles *badly* concentric consecutive waypoints. I adapted it because it normally uses latitudes and longitudes, not points in the euclidean space.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef optimize(position, waypoints):\r\n    # current position is on the shortest path, cumulative distance starts at zero\r\n    shortest_path = [position.center]\r\n    optimized_distance = 0\r\n\r\n    # if only one waypoint left, go in a straight line\r\n    if len(waypoints) == 1:\r\n        shortest_path.append(waypoints[-1].center)\r\n        optimized_distance += distance(position.center, waypoints[-1].center)\r\n\r\n    else:\r\n        # consider the last optimized point (one) and the next two waypoints (two, three)\r\n        for two, three in zip(waypoints[:], waypoints[1:]):\r\n            one = fast_waypoints[-1]\r\n\r\n            in_heading = get_heading(two.center, one.center)\r\n            in_distance = distance(one.center, two.center)\r\n            out_distance = distance(two.center, three.center)\r\n\r\n            # two next waypoints are concentric\r\n            if out_distance == 0:\r\n                next_target, nb_concentric = find_next_not_concentric(two, waypoints)\r\n                out_heading = get_heading(two.center, next_target.center)\r\n                angle = out_heading - in_heading\r\n                leg_distance = two.radius\r\n                leg_heading = in_heading + (0.5/nb_concentric) * angle\r\n            else:\r\n                out_heading = get_heading(two.center, three.center)\r\n                angle = out_heading - in_heading\r\n                leg_heading = in_heading + 0.5 * angle\r\n                leg_distance = (2 * in_distance * out_distance * math.cos(math.radians(angle * 0.5))) / (in_distance + out_distance)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            best_leg_distance = min(leg_distance, two.radius)\r\n            next_best = get_offset(two.center, leg_heading, min_leg_distance)\r\n            shortest_path.append(next_best.center)\r\n            optimized_distance += distance(one.center, next_best.center)\r\n\r\n    return optimized_distance, shortest_path\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see how to test for the different corner cases but I think this approach is bad, because there may be other corner cases I haven&#39;t thought of.

Here is fairly standard Hadoop streaming reducer code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprev_key = None\r\nvalues = []\r\n\r\nfor line in sys.stdin:\r\n    key, value = line.strip().split(&quot;\\t&quot;)\r\n\r\n    if key != prev_key and prev_key is not None:\r\n        score += math.fabs(values[0] - values[1])\r\n        n_records += 1\r\n        values = []\r\n    values.append(float(value))\r\n    prev_key = key\r\n\r\nif prev_key is not None:\r\n    score += math.fabs(values[0] - values[1])\r\n    n_records += 1\r\n\r\nscore /= n_records\r\n\r\nprint(score)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, I am not so sure about the log loss implementation.\r\n\r\nI can see that if I blindly apply the formula\r\n\r\n`score += values[0] * math.log(values[1]) + (1 - values[0]) * math.log(1 - values[1])`\r\n\r\nit&#39;s not numerically stable, since does not handle log(0) case.\r\n\r\nBut more importantly, is this formula symmetric against true, pred interchange? Since I merge and sort true and pred files, I can not guarantee that values[0] will always be true target.\r\n\r\nSo the questions are is it possible to calculate log loss in such Hadoop Streaming scenario and it yes, what&#39;s approach to numerically stable calculation?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300130/log-loss-in-python-for-hadoop-streaming","title":"log loss in python for hadoop streaming"},{"tags":["python-3.x","class"],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":11539630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0c8bf12d8e04c1569de2a2fc6e56017?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DexOnWeb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11539630/dexonweb"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570610208,"creation_date":1570610208,"question_id":58300129,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58300129","body_markdown":"I have python class like following, where I have some parent class `Test` and many other classes (e.g. `SomeOtherClass1`, `SomeOtherClass2` etc.).

For example, with something like emails, you should have an email service that listens for events and then sends particular emails for particular events.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you&#39;re doing user registration, for example, when a user signs up, you might have a user service that actually creates the user record. That service would send a &quot;UserCreated&quot; event when it&#39;s done. The email service, then, would respond to &quot;UserCreated&quot; events by sending out a welcome email to the user. You might have other services that also respond to the same events, as well. This abstraction allows you to separate the logic of creating a new user from the tasks that need to happen after a new user is created, which is not the domain of the user service.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300123/the-job-scheduling-service-design/58304837#58304837","title":"The Job Scheduling service design"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12238512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne665.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stonebranch.com","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12238512/stonebranch-com"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12238512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ne665.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stonebranch.com","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12238512/stonebranch-com"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571831200,"last_edit_date":1571831200,"creation_date":1571405335,"answer_id":58451905,"question_id":58300123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58451905","body_markdown":"I&#39;d recommend setting up a controller on top of your microservices architecture.

The idea here is to be able to schedule any job from any micro service, so it shouldn&#39;t be a big deal to schedule new jobs from a new micro service if it&#39;s added to the system.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, what I&#39;m worrying about is an ability to create such service which seems to be independent from domain micro services and another thing is to abstract the service enough, so that the clients wouldn&#39;t know how the service is implemented, which job scheduling library it&#39;s using etc. I&#39;m afraid that it&#39;s impossible to implement what I want.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I have a micro service which needs to send an email with specific content every Friday and another micro service wants to schedule another job. So they both are going to communicate with the job scheduling service I want to implement. Is there any architecture solutions to achieve this?\r\n\r\nSorry for being too abstract, I described the problem as I understand it myself. I hope your hints and thought will help me to find the best approach to have functionality like this.

All `List` and `Map` implementations use the `equals` method of a node to compare them. So if you would&#39;ve a list of strings, and you would try to acquire the index of a string in the list, you don&#39;t need to use the same object. Example:\r\n```  \r\nList&lt;String&gt; list = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\nlist.add(&quot;test&quot;);\r\nint index = list.indexOf(&quot;test&quot;);\r\nSystem.out.println(index);//returns 0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve noticed that all the SparseArray classes of Android use `==` instead of `equals` to compare nodes. Example method (LongSparseArray.java):\r\n```\r\npublic int indexOfValue(E value) {\r\n    if (mGarbage) {\r\n    gc();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; mSize; i++) {\r\n    if (mValues[i] == value) {\r\n        return i;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n        return -1;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you have simple code like this:\r\n```\r\nLongSparseArray&lt;String&gt; localContacts = new LongSparseArray&lt;&gt;();\r\nlocalContacts.put(2, &quot;test&quot;);\r\nint index = localContacts.indexOfValue(&quot;test&quot;);\r\nSystem.out.println(index);\r\n```\r\nThe index here would return -1 (which is pretty unexpected if you don&#39;t how the value is compared).\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering... why does Android not use `equals`? This is way more handy and preferred (from a Java point of view). Now I have to loop through all the values of a `SparseArray` and compare them my self, which results in more (unneeded) code (or use a `Map` which causes less performance in Android).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300113/android-sparsearray-value-comparison","title":"Android SparseArray value comparison"},{"tags":["react-native","react-hooks","ref"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":6364839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9CQt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mr. Tuan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6364839/mr-tuan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570679144,"post_id":58303026,"comment_id":102990786,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300111/how-to-get-ref-from-custom-component-in-react-hook/58303026#comment102990786_58303026"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":619,"user_id":6709477,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mQdM4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fayeed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6709477/fayeed"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570620113,"creation_date":1570620113,"answer_id":58303026,"question_id":58300111,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58303026","body_markdown":"You are not passing the ref you get to the `Flatlist` all you need to do is pass it like so:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n    &lt;FlatList\r\n      ref={ref} // create a referenece like so\r\n      extraData={[data, isSpeaker]}\r\n      onEndReached={handleEnd}\r\n      onEndReachedThreshold={0.4}\r\n      data={data}\r\n      keyExtractor={(item, index) =&gt; index.toString()}\r\n      renderItem={renderItems}\r\n    /&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300111/how-to-get-ref-from-custom-component-in-react-hook/58303026#58303026","title":"How to get ref from custom component in react hook?"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":6364839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9CQt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mr. Tuan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6364839/mr-tuan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34,"user_id":6364839,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/H9CQt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mr. Tuan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6364839/mr-tuan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571044089,"creation_date":1570610131,"last_edit_date":1570679100,"question_id":58300111,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58300111","body_markdown":"I have this code, using React.useRef() but not working:\r\nMain.js:\r\n```\r\nimport * as React from &quot;react&quot;\r\nexport const Main: React.FunctionComponent&lt;Props&gt; = observer((props) =&gt; {\r\n  const ref = React.useRef()\r\n  \r\n  React.useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    ///Can not get ref from message\r\n    ref.gotoPosition(5)\r\n  }, [])\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;View style={styles.container}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Message\r\n        ref={ref}\r\n        getGotoIndex={getFunction}\r\n        onEndList={isShowQuickMove}\r\n        isSpeaker={state.isSpeaker}\r\n        questionsList={state.questionsList}\r\n        clickQuestion={clickQuestion}\r\n        isTyping={chatStore.loading}\r\n        data={state.data}/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/View&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMessage.js:\r\n```\r\nimport * as React from &quot;react&quot;\r\n// eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name\r\nexport const Message = React.forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; ({\r\n  const { ... } = props\r\n \r\n  const gotoPosition = (index) =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(&#39;in here&#39;)\r\n  }\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;View&gt;\r\n....\r\n&lt;/View&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n)\r\n```\r\nI can not get ref from Message, even i used React.forwardRef.

I first thought I&#39;ll code a player in C++ using wxWidgets, but then I thought why not just using the web browser. Everyone does have one, and a high percentage of users have browsers with HTML5 support. With the HTML video tag, you can embed a MP4 video on a HTML site in a .html file that is locally stored on the filesystem. Not a problem right know, I am able to embed the video with\r\n```\r\n&lt;video width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; controls autoplay&gt;\r\n    &lt;source src=&quot;somefile.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/video&gt;\r\n```\r\nIt plays fine on firefox (win, mac, android, ios), opera (win, mac), chrome (win, mac, android, ios), ms edge (win) and safari (mac, ios).\r\n\r\nNow I wanted to add subtitles to the video.\r\nNow, you cant use SubRipText (.srt) files because no browser supports it, instead mostly all recent browsers use the WebVTT format. It&#39;s very similar to SRT, so I used a python script to generate WebVTT files from SRT. Im pretty sure I produced valid WebVTT code. I used validators, looked into the official specification of WebVTT, even viewed some tutorials on how WebVtt files are being correctly made.\r\nWith the track tag inside the video element you can specify your WebVTT subtitle file as follows:\r\n```\r\n&lt;video width=&quot;1280&quot; height=&quot;720&quot; controls autoplay&gt;\r\n    &lt;source src=&quot;somefile.mp4&quot; type=&quot;video/mp4&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;track default src=&quot;somefile.vtt&quot; kind=&quot;captions&quot; srclang=&quot;de&quot; label=&quot;Deutsch&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/video&gt;\r\n```\r\nMost of the web browsers HTML5 players can see that I added a WebVTT subtitle file, and I can see on safari, firefox, edge and ie that the subtitles are in german (label=&quot;Deutsch&quot;) and it lets me select them. However, no browser except safari on macos do show the subtitles as overlay on the video. I have looked up the WebVTT support on web browsers and all common browsers support it since ages.\r\n\r\nThe WebVTT looks like this:\r\n\r\n    WEBVTT\r\n    \r\n    1\r\n    00:00:00.833 --&gt; 00:00:04.464\r\n    Bevor ich in die Details zu C++17 einsteige,\r\n    \r\n    2\r\n    00:00:04.465 --&gt; 00:00:09.342\r\n    m&#246;chte ich Ihnen erst mal einen &#220;berblick geben zur Historie von C++.\r\n    \r\n    3\r\n    00:00:09.343 --&gt; 00:00:14.823\r\n    C++ ist eine ziemlich alte Sprache, mittlerweile an die 40 Jahre alt.\r\n    \r\n    4\r\n    00:00:14.824 --&gt; 00:00:19.990\r\n    Wenn Sie sich die Zeitlinie hier anschauen, sehen Sie, das seit C++11,\r\n    \r\n    5\r\n    00:00:19.991 --&gt; 00:00:23.849\r\n    wir alle drei Jahre einen neuen C++-Standard bekommen.\r\n    \r\n    6\r\n    00:00:23.850 --&gt; 00:00:26.709\r\n    Doch was ist in C++98 drin?\r\n    \r\n    7\r\n    00:00:26.710 --&gt; 00:00:33.403\r\n    Mit C++98 bekam C++ Templates, das hei&#223;t generische Programmierung,\r\n    \r\n    8\r\n    00:00:33.404 --&gt; 00:00:38.050\r\n    auf der die Standard Template Library basiert, mit ihren Containern\r\n    \r\n    9\r\n    00:00:38.051 --&gt; 00:00:39.448\r\n    und Algorithmen.\r\n    \r\n    10\r\n    00:00:39.449 --&gt; 00:00:44.610\r\n    Nat&#252;rlich hat C++ auch Strings und I/O-Streams f&#252;r die Ein- und Ausgabe.\r\n    \r\n    11\r\n    00:00:44.611 --&gt; 00:00:50.064\r\n    C++11 war der zweite gro&#223;e, richtige C++-Standard.\r\n    \r\n    12\r\n    00:00:50.065 --&gt; 00:00:54.126\r\n    In diesem Standard gibt es auf Ebene der Kernsprache Move Semantik;\r\n    \r\n    13\r\n    00:00:54.127 --&gt; 00:00:57.508\r\n    die vereinheitlichte Initialisierung mit geschweiften Klammern;\r\n    \r\n    14\r\n    00:00:57.509 --&gt; 00:01:02.097\r\n    automatische Typableitung in der Form von auto und decltype;\r\n    \r\n    15\r\n    00:01:02.098 --&gt; 00:01:05.463\r\n    Lambda-Funktionen aus der funktionalen Programmierung\r\n    \r\n    16\r\n    00:01:05.464 --&gt; 00:01:07.383\r\n    und constexpr.\r\n    \r\n    17\r\n    00:01:07.384 --&gt; 00:01:10.439\r\n    constexpr bedeutet, dass Sie Variablen,\r\n    \r\n    18\r\n    00:01:10.440 --&gt; 00:01:13.072\r\n    Funktionen und auch benutzerdefinierte Typen\r\n    \r\n    19\r\n    00:01:13.073 --&gt; 00:01:16.659\r\n    zur Compile-Zeit instanziieren k&#246;nnen.\r\n    \r\n    20\r\n    00:01:16.660 --&gt; 00:01:21.602\r\n    Dar&#252;ber hinaus unterst&#252;tzt C++11 Multithreading und besitzt\r\n    \r\n    21\r\n    00:01:21.603 --&gt; 00:01:22.821\r\n    ein Speichermodell.\r\n    \r\n    22\r\n    00:01:22.822 --&gt; 00:01:28.053\r\n    Das hei&#223;t, C++11 erlaubt Ihnen das erste Mal, mehrere Kerne\r\n    \r\n    23\r\n    00:01:28.054 --&gt; 00:01:32.284\r\n    mit der standardisierten C++-Schnittstelle anzusprechen.\r\n    \r\n    24\r\n    00:01:32.285 --&gt; 00:01:37.557\r\n    Mit C++11 haben wir aber auch einige neue Bibliotheken bekommen,\r\n    \r\n    25\r\n    00:01:37.558 --&gt; 00:01:40.890\r\n    insbesondere Bibliotheken f&#252;r regul&#228;re Ausdr&#252;cke;\r\n    \r\n    26\r\n    00:01:40.891 --&gt; 00:01:45.302\r\n    f&#252;r Smart Pointer; Hashtabellen, auch bekannt als Dictionaries,\r\n    \r\n    27\r\n    00:01:45.303 --&gt; 00:01:47.379\r\n    und std::array.\r\n    \r\n    28\r\n    00:01:47.380 --&gt; 00:01:49.645\r\n    Was ist mit C++14 passiert?\r\n    \r\n    29\r\n    00:01:49.646 --&gt; 00:01:50.705\r\n    Nicht so viel.\r\n\r\nCannot figure out why it is not showing up except on safari.

Here an example code:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;pch.h&quot; // use stdafx.h in Visual Studio 2017 and earlier  COMPULSORY TO ADD\r\n    #include &quot;HEADERNAME.h&quot; // COMPULSORY TO ADD\r\n    #include lib#1\r\n    #include lib#2\r\n    #include lib#3\r\n    ...\r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \t\r\n    void funName1(...)\r\n    {\r\n    \t...\r\n    }\r\n    void funName2(...)\r\n    {\r\n    \t...\r\n    }\r\n    void funName3(...)\r\n    {\r\n    \t...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nTo be able to pass the arrays between python and c++, in my solution, the use of pointers is needed and no return must be used. The output variable is passed as an input variable, initialized in python, using a pointer. In the DLL the memory cells of the output variables are re-wrote and, doing so, when the DLL completes the function, the output is computed and already usable by python without return.\r\nHere an example of how to write a function using pointers for input and output arrays:\r\n\r\n    void funName(double* inputArray_pointer, double* outputArray_pointer, int extraVariable)\r\n    {\r\n    \tdouble inner_var = 100;\r\n    \tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; extraVariable; i++)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tinner_var = min(inner_var, *(inputArray_pointer+i));\r\n    \t\t*(outputArray_pointer + i) = inner_var;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen rebuild the DLL.\r\n\r\n***Python part***\r\n\r\nTo use correctly a DLL in the python code, the modules &#39;ctypes&#39; and &#39;numpy&#39; must be imported.\r\nHere follows an example of the python code (This will use the example DLL of point (9)):\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    import ctypes\r\n    \r\n    cpp_fun = ctypes.CDLL(R&#39;pathToDll/DLLname.dll&#39;)  \r\n    \r\n    # Define the types of the arguments of the DLL (pointer, int, double, ecc)\r\n    cpp_fun.funName.argtypes = [np.ctypeslib.ndpointer(),\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t\tnp.ctypeslib.ndpointer(),\r\n      \t\t\t\t\t\t    ctypes.c_int]\r\n        \r\n    # Allocate or define the input variables using numpy or the standard scalar of python (int, float, ecc..)\r\n    inputArray = np.array([0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...,1000]).reshape(-1).astype(&#39;f8&#39;)\r\n    outputArray = np.zeros([inputArray.shape[0]])astype(&#39;f8&#39;)\r\n    extraVariable = inputArray.shape[0]\r\n    cpp_fun.funName(inputArray, outputArray, extraVariable)\r\n\r\nDoing so, in the variable &#39;outputArray&#39; we will find the result of the calculations performed inside the DLL as a np array structure.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58300063/how-to-use-a-dll-that-returns-array-pointer-in-python/58336054#58336054","title":"How to use a dll that returns array pointer in python?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12186894,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q7ut1b_Okxo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfM79o4oAOGAHcMksbZwy8f0PNNGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alessio Salvaggio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12186894/alessio-salvaggio"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12186894,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Q7ut1b_Okxo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfM79o4oAOGAHcMksbZwy8f0PNNGg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alessio Salvaggio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12186894/alessio-salvaggio"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570778228,"creation_date":1570609972,"last_edit_date":1570778228,"question_id":58300063,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58300063","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get out an array in a pythonic format [numpy or list] form a DLLwritten in c#/c++.

It simply doesn&#39;t do anything, no error msg, nothing and shows like-\r\n\r\n    (venv) XYZ-MBP:TaskManager xyz$ python app.py\r\n    (venv) XYZ-MBP:TaskManager xyz$

Flutter, I have an app with a custom Slider inside a custom ListView widget. The only problem is that when you move the slider handle (left to right), the page will still scroll (up and down) due to the ListView, whereas I would need the page to lock in place until the user stops moving the slider.\r\n\r\nI started off by having a look at the material app slider code but couldn&#39;t find anything that would help. I&#39;ve also played around with the slider and it has the effect that I am trying to achieve, which tells me the problem lies in the my custom slider. *\r\n\r\nI am using a Listener in the slider widget to detect gestures so I would assume that I am missing a few lines in there somewhere?\r\nAny help would be appreciated, cheers.\r\n\r\nUpdate: * I have also tried changing the behaviour of the listener but that hasn&#39;t seemed to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nHere is the slider within the ListView -\r\nNote: the slider can have multiple handles (hence why it&#39;s custom) but in this case just showing a single to avoid confusion.\r\n```\r\n@override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return ListView(children: &lt;Widget&gt;[\r\n    Center(\r\n     child: StagedSlider.single(\r\n      value: point,\r\n      //A function which changes the handle value\r\n      onChanged: setHandleInfo,\r\n     ),\r\n    ),\r\n...\r\n```\r\nHere is the listener inside the slider:\r\n```\r\nreturn Listener(\r\n      behavior: HitTestBehavior.translucent,\r\n      //The following return functions to calculate handle\r\n      //position/progress...\r\n      onPointerDown: someFunction(),\r\n      onPointerMove: someFunction(),\r\n      onPointerUp: someFunction(),\r\n      //Child is a stack of handles/thumbs calculated higher up\r\n      child: handles,\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n```\r\nJust as an example, if you were to move the slider handle in a vertical-upwards motion, the handle would move along the horizontal axis and the whole page would move down vertically.\r\nOn the other handle, the Material App Slider does not do this and in this case would only move the handle.\r\n\r\nUpdate2:\r\nSo a quick fix for this would be to just use a Gesture Detector instead of a Listener. I tried it out and all the issues seemed to have been fixed. However, due to another unrelated issue I was having earlier if someone had a solution using the Listener that would be great.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58299959/how-to-lock-page-scrolling-when-moving-a-slider","title":"How to lock page scrolling when moving a

Is there any other option I can try?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58299955/how-to-add-a-single-backslash-to-a-string-to-show-a-chinese-character","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"how to add a single backslash to a string to show a Chinese character"},{"tags":["kubernetes-helm"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2283,"user_id":7641078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yB95H.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Eduardo Baitello","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7641078/eduardo-baitello"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571690725,"creation_date":1571690725,"answer_id":58493890,"question_id":58299952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58493890","body_markdown":"As you are using `|` on your YAML, you are defining a [Multiline YAML String][1], which means that your `configuration` key has a single string value with line breaks on it (`\\n`).\r\n\r\nYou can simply define your ConfigMap template like this:\r\n\r\n    apiVersion: v1\r\n    kind: ConfigMap\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: &quot;{{ template &quot;app.fullname&quot; . }}-config&quot;\r\n    data:\r\n      my.cfg:\r\n    {{- toYaml $.Values.configuration | nindent 4 }}\r\n\r\nAfter rendering, the resulting ConfigMap will be deployed as:\r\n```\r\napiVersion: v1\r\ndata:\r\n  my.cfg: |\r\n    [core]\r\n    # Some comments\r\n    my_folder = /usr/local/my_folder\r\n\r\n    # The folder where my app should store its log files\r\n    # This path must be absolute\r\n    base_log_folder = /usr/local/app/logs\r\n\r\n    # Logging options\r\n    remote_logging = False\r\n    remote_log_conn_id =\r\n    remote_base_log_folder =\r\n    encrypt_logs = False\r\nkind: ConfigMap\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: test-config\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://yaml-multiline.info/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58299952/helm-grabbing-content-of-a-file-from-values-yaml/58493890#58493890","title":"Helm: grabbing content of a file from values.yaml"}],"owner":{"reputation":4099,"user_id":2718151,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7fbf5d5ebe5c06ec8f0db845d356b157?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nicola Ben","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2718151/nicola-ben"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571690725,"creation_date":1570609600,"question_id":58299952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58299952","body_markdown":"I am trying to put the content of a configuration file inside `values.yaml` and get it.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nThis is the values.yaml:\r\n```\r\nconfiguration: |\r\n  [core]\r\n  # Some comments\r\n  my_folder = /usr/local/my_folder\r\n\r\n  # The folder where my app should store its log files\r\n  # This path must be absolute\r\n  base_log_folder = /usr/local/app/logs\r\n\r\n  # Logging options\r\n  remote_logging = False\r\n  remote_log_conn_id =\r\n  remote_base_log_folder =\r\n  encrypt_logs = False\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this is a configMap where I should put the content in:\r\n\r\n```\r\napiVersion: v1\r\nkind: ConfigMap\r\nmetadata:\r\n  name: &quot;{{ template &quot;app.fullname&quot; . }}-config&quot;\r\ndata:\r\n  my.cfg: |\r\n{{ HELM }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn &quot;HELM&quot; tag, I tried several options of `tpl` and `include`, all without reaching my goal.\r\n\r\nAs non-optimal solution I put the content of my `configuration` in a file and grab it with\r\n\r\n    {{ .Files.Get &quot;files/my.configuration&quot; | indent 4 }}\r\n\r\n\r\nI am asking for some suggestions about the possibility to have all in `values.yaml`, please.
