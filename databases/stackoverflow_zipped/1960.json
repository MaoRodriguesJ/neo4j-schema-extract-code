You can write a function that checks if the string consists of just the characters you want to accept, and call it in your your condition. Something like this:\r\n\r\n    char input[128];\r\n    if (scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, input) != 1 &amp;&amp; check_input(input))\r\n\r\nOf course you will have to convert the `input` to a float yourself (maybe using `atof()` or `strtof()`), and do something with the Q.

Pick an unique name per header file.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075580/error-1098-conflicting-declarations-when-function-types-changes/58077006#58077006","title":"&quot;error: (1098) conflicting declarations&quot; when function types changes"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":10946437,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5accd6caad1c18f822ed1a7bc2d5b6a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Praveen Kumar P S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10946437/praveen-kumar-p-s"},"last_editor":{"reputation":122254,"user_id":584518,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04001fd900a9ee6a0041e1842d5cf47e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lundin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/584518/lundin"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58077006,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569316840,"creation_date":1569311726,"last_edit_date":1569316712,"question_id":58075580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075580","body_markdown":"I get conflicting declarations error when types of function is changed from int to void.

When I type *else* in C/C++ (not *if*, just *else*), it will auto-insert brackets with the following style :\r\n\r\n```C\r\n    if\r\n    {\r\n        &lt;instructions&gt;\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        &lt;&gt;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand will place the cursor at `&lt;&gt;` waiting for me to input instructions. My style however is that of the `if` above. How to change this ?\r\n\r\nTo be more specific as to why it bugs me : After typing the word `else`, according to my style I will press `Enter` to go to a new line where I will place the opening bracket. But at this stage an auto-insert local menu will have shown up at the cursor, with the first option pre-selected, such that pressing `Enter` will be interpreted as me choosing this first option - yielding the style above. And I don&#39;t want to press `Escape` everytime I enter an `else` just to avoid this !\r\n\r\nI could find no option or setting that controls this. Is there one ?\r\n\r\nAnother info : when typing `if(&lt;condition&gt;)` no such thing happens. I will press `Enter`, enter an opening bracket, and upon pressing `Enter` again, it will simply insert a new line with a closing bracket after the cursor - that&#39;s nice.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075571/qt-creator-4-9-2-change-auto-insert-style","title":"Qt Creator 4.9.2 : Change auto-insert style"},{"tags":["php","mysql","arrays","dynamic","accordion"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":393,"user_id":11790698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/434ed85c78ef8c2ccfd23fbc521125ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dodzb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11790698/dodzb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569407483,"post_id":58075570,"comment_id":102584847,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075570/php-accordion-content-using-php-mysql-query-data#comment102584847_58075570"},{"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":5264403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10150652254479999/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pete Hayman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5264403/pete-hayman"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":393,"user_id":11790698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/434ed85c78ef8c2ccfd23fbc521125ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dodzb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11790698/dodzb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569433693,"post_id":58075570,"comment_id":102599054,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075570/php-accordion-content-using-php-mysql-query-data#comment102599054_58075570"}],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":5264403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10150652254479999/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pete Hayman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5264403/pete-hayman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":5264403,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10150652254479999/picture?type=large","display_name":"Pete Hayman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5264403/pete-hayman"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569433662,"creation_date":1569311691,"last_edit_date":1569433662,"question_id":58075570,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075570","body_markdown":"I have a list of soccer results stored in a MySQL database.

The query/code I&#39;ve so far developed to try and achieve this is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$query = &quot;SELECT mt.ID,mt.ID1,re.date,re.season,re.venue,re.comp,re.opponent,re.score,ce.name,ce.ID,re.ID FROM resultengine re INNER JOIN matchteam mt ON re.ID=mt.ID INNER JOIN clubengine ce ON re.opponent=ce.ID WHERE (mt.ID1=&#39;0&#39; or mt.ID1=&#39;9998&#39;) ORDER BY re.season ASC, re.date ASC&quot;;\r\n$result2 = mysqli_query($mysqli, $query) or trigger_error(&quot;Query Failed!

So, this means one result is visible under each season – the live example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.boroguide.co.uk/missing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To get it showing as intended with **all** results from one season showing in the appropriate panel, I&#39;m missing a step (or component) from my query – and I can&#39;t work out what it is.\r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that I need to use ```foreach``` in some capacity, but can&#39;t figure this out. I&#39;ve used answers to questions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56395502/dynamically-generate-an-accordion-based-on-array-data) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21967276/group-mysql-results-by-category-and-display-them-into-groups-under-each-category) as possible solutions.

all the comments I&#39;ve imagined two possible solutions:\r\n\r\n## Broadcast when a user logs in / out\r\n\r\nThis is the very simple solution. You can use [laravel notifications](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/notifications) that allows you to implement a specific broadcast logic:\r\n\r\n* During the login / logout phase create a `UserLogged[In|Out]` notification and broadcast it to a specific channel\r\n* Using [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/broadcasting#receiving-broadcasts) and a &quot;few lines&quot; of javascript, update your `onlineUsers` list (for example in VueJs you may want to update the Vuex store)\r\n\r\nBut this may require a more complex logic and you may have to write a lot of code to keep the online users list updated... I think it&#39;s better to move to solution #2...\r\n\r\n## Use [presence channels](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/presence-channels)\r\n\r\nI think this is the best way, since it doesn&#39;t require nothing else that a good Laravel-echo configuration. For the example I&#39;m using Pusher (since you asked for), but this solution can be implemented with all the Laravel broadcast drivers. \r\n\r\n * When a user logs in, simply subscribe him / her to a presence channel ([here](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/broadcasting#presence-channels) the Laravel documentation)\r\n * Using Laravel Echo, subscribe the user to that channel\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar chatRoom = Echo.join(&#39;my.chat.room.id&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n * Once subscribed use the[`members.count`](https://pusher.com/docs/channels/using_channels/presence-channels#members-count-number-) method to keep an updated list of the channel users.\r\n * Using a `setTimeout()` function you can have a realtime update of the users list.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nI&#39;ve never implemented this solutions in a production environment, but just wrote some code to see how it works. so I think that if other people have diffent point of view or have a better way to explain this process I will be happy to update my answer.

am facing few Performance issues while Sending Data From Server To Browser Using Server Sent Events.

Which initiates `SseEmitter` and also implemented an `@EventListener` method(`onEventEmitter`) which will be invoked whenever I try to publish message/Object event( `this.eventPublisher.publishEvent(chain)`).\r\n\r\nI am here trying a simple thing.. Whenever chain process executed successfully on the scheduled time, Automatically UI have to update the Latest status, completion time and other details. \r\nSo, I have to publish an event(i.e., `this.eventPublisher.publishEvent(chain)`) at the start  and end of the `Chain` execution.\r\n\r\nSO far it&#39;s working fine, after publishing an event manually, `onEventEmitter` method is getting invoked and sent to the browser method `refreshChainStatus` to `onMesaage` block and gets the work done as per the requirement. \r\n\r\nBut here comes the issue, The handler method(`getSseEmitter`) in `ChainController` is frequently getting executed and also console is getting filled with the below mentioned errors.\r\n\r\nError in Browser console : \r\nFailed to load resource: net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE\r\n\r\nError in UI Editor console : \r\n[HPM] GET /XXXXXX/rest/api/refreshChainStatus -&gt;

That is not a time zone.\r\n\r\nThe value `GMT-4` represents merely an [offset-from-UTC][2]. A number of hours-minutes-seconds ahead or behind the UTC baseline. \r\n\r\nA time zone is *much* more. A time zone has a name, and represents the history of past, present, and future changes the offset used by the people of a particular region. Therefore, a time zone is always preferable to a mere offset.\r\n\r\nSpecify a [proper time zone name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones_by_name) in the format of `Continent/Region`, such as `America/Montreal`, `Africa/Casablanca`, or `Pacific/Auckland`. Never use the 2-4 letter abbreviation such as `EST` or `IST` as they are *not* true time zones, not standardized, and not even unique(!). \r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;Africa/Casablanca&quot; ) ;  \r\n\r\nIf your time zone is currently four hours behind UTC, you must be in a time zone such as `America/Aruba`, `America/Puerto_Rico`, `America/Manaus`, `America/Martinique`, etc.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Martinique&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\n# UTC\r\n\r\n&gt;I Have UTC String with a format (HH: mm: ss)\r\n\r\nNope. \r\n\r\nA value such as `&quot;12:15:00&quot;` cannot be said to be a value in UTC. Without a date, that value has no real meaning. A moment consists of three parts: \r\n\r\n - a date, \r\n - a time-of-day, and \r\n - an offset/zone. \r\n\r\nSaying &quot;noon in UTC&quot; only gives us 2 of the 3 parts. The date is missing.\r\n\r\n# Today… what a concept\r\n\r\nPerhaps you want to apply that time-of-day to the current date as seen in UTC.\r\n\r\n    LocalDate todayUTC = LocalDate.now( ZoneOffset.UTC ) ;\r\n\r\nJust keep in mind that **for any given moment the date varies around the globe by zone**. At this very moment, the date is “tomorrow“ in Tokyo Japan while still being “yesterday” in Toledo Ohio US. \r\n\r\n## `OffsetDateTime`\r\n\r\nCombine all three into a [`OffsetDateTime`][3] object: date, time-of-day, and offset/zone. \r\n\r\n    LocalTime localTime = LocalTime.parse( &quot;12:15:00&quot; ) ;\r\n    OffsetDateTime odt = OffsetDateTime.of( todayUTC , localTime, ZoneOffset.UTC ) ;\r\n\r\n## `ZonedDateTime`\r\n\r\nAdjust from UTC to your particular time zone. Same moment, same simultaneous point on the timeline, different wall-clock time. Apply a `ZoneId` to get a [`ZonedDateTime`][4] object. The time zone nows about if and when [Daylight Saving Time (DST)][5] applies for this particular zone, and adjusts accordingly.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Martinique&quot; ) ;\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = odt.atZoneSameInstant( z ) ;\r\n\r\n# Wrong approach\r\n\r\nYou should not be adding/subtracting some number of hours from a `LocalTime`. On some dates in some zones, a particular time-of-day may not exist. For example, for Daylight Saving Time, on the day of &quot;Spring-ahead&quot;, in the United States, a time-of-day of 02:15:00 does not exist, as the clock jumps ahead from 02:00:00 to 03:00:00. \r\n\r\nThe correct approach using the `ZonedDateTime` class will automatically adjust accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/58076337/642706\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/OffsetDateTime.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/ZonedDateTime.html\r\n  [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075519/convert-utc-time-hhmmss-to-device-time-hhmmss-and-adding-day-saving-time-if/58089060#58089060","title":"Convert UTC TIme HH:mm:ss to Device time HH:mm:ss and adding Day saving time if available"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":8585220,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ezIEDMr-XbE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACpc/hFVVXQ4O2Lk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"koushik chaturvedula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8585220/koushik-chaturvedula"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4046,"user_id":1712135,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cErYR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"deHaar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1712135/dehaar"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58076337,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569366028,"creation_date":1569311504,"last_edit_date":1569314957,"question_id":58075519,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075519","body_markdown":"I Have UTC String with a format (HH: mm: ss) and I need to convert the String value into device Time in the same format (HH: mm: ss) and also adding  Day saving time if available I Have Tried to convert the UTC String to device time by this code but I am getting a 1 hour delay due to (day saving time).\r\n\r\n```Java\r\nString utcTimeString = &quot;12:15:00&quot;\r\nSimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;HH: mm: ss&quot;);\r\nformatter.setTimeZone(TimeZone.getTimeZone(&quot;UTC&quot;));\r\nDate value = formatter.parse(utcTimeString);\r\n\r\nSimpleDateFormat dateFormatter = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;HH: mm: ss&quot;);

Though it helped me but doesn&#39;t get me the expected output for this updated/new requirement. As we do left join, it copies all records. I can&#39;t do inner join either because it will drop non-match column. I want a mix of left join and inner join\r\n\r\nCurrently it creates new records for all 365 days in a year which I don&#39;t want. something like below. This is not expected\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**I only wish to add missing dates between input date interval as shown below. For example subject = 1, in the 4th month has records from 3rd and 5th. but 4th is missing. So we add record for 4th day alone. We don&#39;t need 6th,7th etc unlike current output. Similarly in 7th month, record for 7th day missing. so we just add a new record for that**\r\n\r\nI expect my output to be like as shown below\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57784410/how-to-create-a-new-row-on-the-fly-by-copying-previous-row\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jqaiM.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1ZRaX.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075473/how-to-add-missing-dates-within-date-interval","title":"How to add missing dates within date interval?"},{"tags":["carrierwave","rails-admin"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":83,"user_id":1722421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a57a4405663c372d4a60dff12869803e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Remington Charles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1722421/remington-charles"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569404612,"post_id":58075545,"comment_id":102583307,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075469/railsadmin-carrierwave-multiple-upload-undefined-method-filename-for-nilnilcl/58075545#comment102583307_58075545"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5476,"user_id":4055042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd04c63d95d27033b53d4d83fea40c02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SRack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4055042/srack"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569311602,"creation_date":1569311602,"answer_id":58075545,"question_id":58075469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58075545","body_markdown":"The problem here is certain `uploader`s don&#39;t have a file attached.

I&#39;ve looked at the guide on the Github for react-redux-notify. It has a lot of errors and weird code examples, so I see it&#39;s easy to get confused.\r\n\r\nYour code has the following issues:\r\n\r\n**Connect**  \r\nYou&#39;re first of all need to connect your component to your redux store with `connect`. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re doing it, but it&#39;s missing in the code you provided.\r\n\r\n**createNotification**  \r\nThis is where the code examples in the guide get confusing. The `createNotification` is an action that you import from react-redux-notify, just like you&#39;re doing. But it&#39;s not a method that you can call directly from the component. In redux, actions have to be dispatched from the component. So what you&#39;re missing is the `dispatch` method that can be retrieved from the component props, when you&#39;ve connected it to the store. The guide for react-redux-notify suggests using `mapDispatchToProps` which is a way of binding a method to dispatch a given action directly to the props of the component.\r\n\r\nSo your component code should like this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { connect } from &#39;react-redux&#39;;\r\nimport { Notify } from &#39;react-redux-notify&#39;;\r\nimport {\r\n  createNotification,\r\n  NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SUCCESS,\r\n} from &#39;react-redux-notify&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst mySuccessNotification = {\r\n  message: &#39;You have been logged in!&#39;,\r\n  type: NOTIFICATION_TYPE_SUCCESS,\r\n  duration: 0,\r\n  canDismiss: true,\r\n  icon: &lt;i className=&quot;fa fa-check&quot; /&gt;,\r\n};\r\n\r\nfunction createRestaurantSetup(props) {\r\n  function changeState() {\r\n    const { dispatchNotification } = props;\r\n\r\n    dispatchNotification(mySuccessNotification);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;div className={classes.root}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Notify /&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;Button type=&quot;submit&quot; size=&quot;small&quot; color=&quot;primary&quot; onClick={changeState}&gt;\r\n        Start Setting\r\n      &lt;/Button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nconst mapDispatchToProps = dispatch =&gt; ({\r\n  dispatchNotification: (config) =&gt; dispatch(createNotification(config)),\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport default connect(null, mapDispatchToProps)(createRestaurantSetup);\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnlike the guide on the github, I renamed the `createNotifcation` prop to `dispatchNotification` so it&#39;s easier to differentiate the two. The code for the reducer should be fine.\r\n\r\nHope this helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075459/im-unable-to-show-notifcation-in-reactjs-app-im-using-react-redux-notify/58075691#58075691","title":"I&#39;m unable to show notifcation in reactjs app I&#39;m using react-redux-notify"}],"owner":{"reputation":134,"user_id":2590801,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/klDaT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Muhammad Mudassir","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2590801/muhammad-mudassir"},"last_editor":{"reputation":453,"user_id":3521108,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3umVn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Phoenix1355","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3521108/phoenix1355"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58075691,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569324178,"creation_date":1569311283,"last_edit_date":1569324178,"question_id":58075459,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075459","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using `react-redux-notify` to show notification in my app. I&#39;m using a functional component for my app. I have followed all the guide given on their Github repo.

My part of the job is to research SSE.\r\n\r\nI created small express application which generates random numbers and it all works fine. The only thing that bugs me is correct way to reconnect on server error.\r\n\r\nMy implementation looks like this:\r\n\r\n      private createSseSource(): Observable&lt;MessageEvent&gt; {\r\n        return Observable.create(observer =&gt; {\r\n          this.eventSource = new EventSource(SSE_URL);\r\n          this.eventSource.onmessage = (event) =&gt; {\r\n            this.zone.run(() =&gt; observer.next(event));\r\n          };\r\n\r\n        this.eventSource.onopen = (event) =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;connection open&#39;);\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        this.eventSource.onerror = (error) =&gt; {\r\n          console.log(&#39;looks like the best thing to do is to do nothing&#39;);\r\n          // this.zone.run(() =&gt; observer.error(error));\r\n          // this.closeSseConnection();\r\n          // this.reconnectOnError();\r\n        };\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI tried to implement `reconnectOnError()` function following this [answer][1], but I just wasn&#39;t able to make it work. Then I ditched the `reconnectOnError()` function and it seems like it&#39;s a better thing to do. Do not try to close and reconnect nor propagate error to observable. Just sit and wait and when the server is running again it will reconnect automatically.\r\n\r\n**Question is, is this really the best thing to do?** Important thing to mention is, that the FE application communicates with it&#39;s own server which can&#39;t be accessed by another instance of the app (built-in device).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

How to normalize data\n\nUsually, neural networks benefit from data coming from Gaussian Standard distribution (mean `0` and variance `1`).\n\nTechniques like Batch Normalization (simplifying), help neural net to have this trait throughout the whole network, so it&#39;s usually beneficial.\n\nThere are other approaches that you mentioned, to tell reliably what helps for which problem and specified architecture you just have to check and measure.\n\n## 2. What about test data?\n\nMean to subtract and variance to divide each instance by (or any other statistic you gather by any normalization scheme mentioned previously) should be gathered from your training dataset. If you take them from test, you perform data leakage (info about test distribution is incorporated into training) and you may get false impression your algorithm performs better than in reality.\n\nSo just compute statistics over training dataset and use them on incoming/validation/test data as well.

Would it be more realistic to scale the Data from -1 to 1, or is 0 to 1 a better way, I tested it and 0 to 1 seemed to be faster. Is there a wrong way to do it? Or would it just be slower to learn?\r\n\r\nSecond question: When do I normalize the data? I split the data into training and testdata, do I have to scale / normalize this data seperately? maybe the trainingdata is only ranging between +300 to -200 and the testdata ranges from +600 to -100. Thats not very good I guess.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand... If I scale / normalize the entire dataframe and split it after that, the data is fine for training and test, but how do I handle real new incomming data? The model is trained to scaled data, so I have to scale the new data as well, right? But what if the new Data is 1000? the normalization would turn this into something more then 1, because its a bigger number then everything else before.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, when do I normalize data and what happens to completely new data? \r\n\r\nI hope I could make it clear what my problem is :D\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075431/tensorflow-keras-normalize-train-test-realtime-data-or-how-to-handle-real","title":"Tensorflow / Keras: Normalize train / test / realtime Data or how to handle reality?"},{"tags":["python-3.x","class","tkinter-entry"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12089296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BP-7WErnGBI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdVnC4hckJdrw_yWBN8pNgMqRrwLw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mct","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12089296/mct"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3625,"user_id":8566549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0268a88dfbca27a1f18e8ea3974e765a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hasta Dhana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8566549/hasta-dhana"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569311949,"creation_date":1569311159,"last_edit_date":1569311949,"question_id":58075429,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58075429","body_markdown":"**Class to input player names and words**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction for the playernames is here but i dont think it has something to do with my problem so i didn&#39;t copied it in here\r\n\r\n        \r\n    \r\n**function for the player words**\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    def two_players_words(self):\r\n        self.your_word=dict()\r\n        self.total = 0\r\n        self.word1=StringVar()\r\n        self.word2=StringVar()\r\n        self.window2=Tk()\r\n        self.window2.title(&quot;W&#246;rter Eingabe&quot;)\r\n        self.window2.geometry(&quot;500x600&quot;)\r\n        self.label_20=Label(self.window2, text=&quot;W&#246;rter eingabe&quot;,width=25, relief=&quot;solid&quot;, font=(&quot;arial&quot;,12,&quot;bold&quot;))\r\n        self.label_20.pack()\r\n        self.label_21=Label(self.window2,text=self.entry_1.get()+&quot;

I save these topics in a CSV-file, looking like this:\r\n\r\n    Topics; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; &#39;topic 3&#39;; ...; &#39;topic 130&#39;;\r\n\r\nMy issue is that the patent data can be too big (more than 10,000 rows and 4 columns) to analyze. The package can only handle up to 250kB. Is it possible to make a &#39;for loop&#39; to avoid this problem?\r\n\r\nRight now I split the CSV-file and the process is done for each of them.\r\nThe CSV file looks like this:\r\n\r\n    docname; documents/text; day\r\n    44245; [text]; 22.12.2016\r\n    32424; [text]; 12.03.2015\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nThe aim is to create a loop, which goes through this file, analyzes each row and saves the results in one CSV-file.\r\n\r\nThis file should look like this:\r\n\r\n    44245; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n    32424; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n\r\nI&#39;m grateful for any tip or recommendation. \r\n\r\nMy current code looks like this (splitting the file in years and each file with only 10 patents):\r\n\r\n```import textrazor\r\n\r\ntextrazor.api_key = &#39;b033067632dba8a710c57f088115ad4eeff22142629bb1c07c780a10&#39;\r\n\r\nclient = textrazor.TextRazor(extractors= [&quot;entities&quot;, &quot;categories&quot;, &quot;topics&quot;])\r\n\r\nclient.set_classifiers([&#39;textrazor_newscodes&#39;])\r\n\r\ndf17 = open(r&#39;C:\\Users\\Dogan\\Desktop\\Patentdaten\\Patente 2017 Go Pro.csv&#39;).read()\r\n\r\ndf16 = open(r&#39;C:\\Users\\Dogan\\Desktop\\Patentdaten\\Patente 2016 Go Pro.csv&#39;).read()\r\n\r\ndf15 = open(r&#39;C:\\Users\\Dogan\\Desktop\\Patentdaten\\Patente 2015 Go Pro.csv&#39;).read()\r\n\r\ndf14 = open(r&#39;C:\\Users\\Dogan\\Desktop\\Patentdaten\\Patente 2014 Go Pro.csv&#39;).read()\r\n\r\ndf13 = open(r&#39;C:\\Users\\Dogan\\Desktop\\Patentdaten\\Patente 2013 Go Pro.csv&#39;).read()\r\n\r\npatente2017 = df17\r\n\r\npatente2016 = df16\r\n\r\npatente2015 = df15\r\n\r\npatente2014 = df14\r\n\r\npatente2013 = df13\r\n\r\nresponse2017 = client.analyze(patente2017)\r\n\r\nresponse2016 = client.analyze(patente2016)\r\n\r\nresponse2015 = client.analyze(patente2015)\r\n\r\nresponse2014 = client.analyze(patente2014)\r\n\r\nresponse2013 = client.analyze(patente2013)\r\n\r\ntopics2017 = set()\r\ntopics2016 = set()\r\ntopics2015 = set()\r\ntopics2014 = set()\r\ntopics2013 = set()\r\n\r\n\r\nfor topic in response2017.topics():\r\n    if topic.score &gt; 0.5:\r\n        if topic.label not in topics2017:\r\n            topics2017.add(topic.label)\r\n\r\nfor topic in response2016.topics():\r\n    if topic.score &gt; 0.5:\r\n        if topic.label not in topics2016:\r\n            topics2016.add(topic.label)\r\n\r\nfor topic in response2015.topics():\r\n    if topic.score &gt; 0.5:\r\n        if topic.label not in topics2015:\r\n            topics2015.add(topic.label)\r\n\r\nfor topic in response2014.topics():\r\n    if topic.score &gt; 0.5:\r\n        if topic.label not in topics2014:\r\n            topics2014.add(topic.label)\r\n\r\nfor topic in response2013.topics():\r\n    if topic.score &gt; 0.5:\r\n        if topic.label not in topics2013:\r\n            topics2013.add(topic.label)\r\n\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\n\r\nlist_topics2017=list(topics2017)\r\nlist_topics2016=list(topics2016)\r\nlist_topics2015=list(topics2015)\r\nlist_topics2014=list(topics2014)\r\nlist_topics2013=list(topics2013)\r\n\r\ndf17 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({&#39;2017&#39; : list_topics2017}, orient=&#39;index&#39;)\r\ndf16 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({&#39;2016&#39; : list_topics2016}, orient=&#39;index&#39;)\r\ndf15 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({&#39;2015&#39; : list_topics2015}, orient=&#39;index&#39;)\r\ndf14 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({&#39;2014&#39; : list_topics2014}, orient=&#39;index&#39;)\r\ndf13 = pd.DataFrame.from_dict({&#39;2013&#39; : list_topics2013}, orient=&#39;index&#39;)\r\n\r\ndf17.to_csv(&#39;Analyse-2013bis2017-GoPro.csv&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;, header=&#39;Topics Go Pro 2013 - 2017&#39;)\r\ndf16.to_csv(&#39;Analyse-2013bis2017-GoPro.csv&#39;,mode=&#39;a&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;, header=False)\r\ndf15.to_csv(&#39;Analyse-2013bis2017-GoPro.csv&#39;,mode=&#39;a&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;, header=False)\r\ndf14.to_csv(&#39;Analyse-2013bis2017-GoPro.csv&#39;,mode=&#39;a&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;, header=False)\r\ndf13.to_csv(&#39;Analyse-2013bis2017-GoPro.csv&#39;,mode=&#39;a&#39;, sep=&#39;;&#39;, header=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now I get a CSV-file (as mentioned above) like this:\r\n\r\n    2017; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n    2016; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n    2015; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n    2014; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...\r\n    2013; &#39;topic 1&#39;; &#39;topic 2&#39;; ...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075419/how-to-analyze-designated-parts-of-a-csv-file-trick-to-handle-big-csv-files-wit","title":"How to analyze designated parts of a csv file?

ShortField(&quot;Op-Id&quot;, 11),\r\n        IntField(&quot;request-id&quot;, 11),\r\n\r\n        XByteField(&quot;start&quot;, 1),\r\n\r\n        XByteField(&quot;char-code&quot;, 71),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len&quot;, 18),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr1&quot;, b&#39;attributes-charset&#39;),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len-1&quot;, 5),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr-value1&quot;, b&#39;utf-8&#39;),\r\n\r\n        XByteField(&quot;lang-code&quot;, 72),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len-2&quot;, 27),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr2&quot;, b&#39;attributes-natural-language&#39;),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len-3&quot;, 5),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr-value2&quot;, b&#39;en-us&#39;),\r\n\r\n        XByteField(&quot;uri-code&quot;, 69),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len-4&quot;, 11),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr3&quot;, b&#39;printer-uri&#39;),\r\n        ShortField(&quot;len-5&quot;, 34),\r\n        StrField(&quot;attr-value3&quot;, b&#39;http://192.168.80.189:631/printer1&#39;),\r\n\r\n        XByteField(&quot;end&quot;, 3),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    def guess_payload_class(self, payload):\r\n        return payload\r\n```\r\nI added the following code into Python3.7/dist-packages/scapy/layers/ipp.py\r\n\r\nHence IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) is implemented using HTTP, I have added HTTP layer before custom IPP Layer\r\n\r\nTo manage TCP 3-Way Handshake I used scapy StreamSocket\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom scapy.layers.http import HTTP, HTTPRequest\r\nfrom scapy.layers.ipp import IPP\r\nfrom scapy.all import StreamSocket\r\nimport socket\r\n\r\nipp_request = HTTP()/HTTPRequest(\r\n    Method=b&#39;POST&#39;,\r\n    Path=b&#39;/printer1&#39;,\r\n    Connection=b&#39;Keep-Alive&#39;,\r\n    Content_Type=b&#39;application/ipp&#39;,\r\n    User_Agent=b&#39;Internet Print Provider&#39;,\r\n    Content_Length=b&#39;125&#39;,\r\n    Host=b&#39;192.168.80.189:631&#39;\r\n)/IPP()\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;:\r\n\r\n    my_soc = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\r\n    my_soc.connect((&quot;192.168.80.189&quot;, 631))\r\n\r\n    my_stream = StreamSocket(my_soc)\r\n    my_stream.basecls = IPP\r\n\r\n    reply, ans = my_stream.sr(ipp_request)\r\n\r\n```\r\nI am able to send the IPP Packet successfully, But I am not able to receive answers\r\nI am getting response like\r\n\r\n```\r\nBegin emission:\r\nFinished sending 1 packets.\r\n.......\r\nReceived 7 packets, got 0 answers, remaining 1 packets\r\n```\r\nseems to not be working, Any help is greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075396/receving-answers-from-a-custom-layer-with-scapy-using-streamsocket","title":"Receving answers from a

`__name__ == &quot;__main__&quot;` loop juste after `window.show` but it still doesn&#39;t work. \r\nAs you can see I try to update every second the 2 labels but it doesn&#39;t work, so I would be glad if someone can correct me and explain me the problem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58075367/updating-labels-based-on-values-received-on-the-com-port","title":"Updating labels based
