At first I thought there could memory leaks in the scripts, but after further testing I realized this problems arises long before memory runs-out, so shutting down the process and re-starting fixes the issue.\r\n\r\nAster some reading, I&#180;ve come to think that a possible solution would be to use a for loop and a supervisor that calls back the script after the loop is finished, but this doesn&#180;t exactly fixes the original problem.

record version does not work because a record is not stored on the stack. Instead 4 Unsigned_32 elements are stored on the stack. If you really want to work with a record instead of four separate unsigned integer values you can assign the four values to the members of your record within the call to &quot;accepts_struct&quot;.\r\nAda expects the first entry in the stack to be a record, not an unsigned_32.\r\nThe Ada LRM, section 6.4.1 states:\r\n\r\n&gt; For the evaluation of a parameter_association: The actual parameter is\r\n&gt; first evaluated. For an access parameter, the access_definition is\r\n&gt; elaborated, which creates the anonymous access type. For a parameter\r\n&gt; (of any mode) that is passed by reference (see 6.2), a view conversion\r\n&gt; of the actual parameter to the nominal subtype of the formal parameter\r\n&gt; is evaluated, and the formal parameter denotes that conversion. For an\r\n&gt; in or in out parameter that is passed by copy (see 6.2), the formal\r\n&gt; parameter object is created, and the value of the actual parameter is\r\n&gt; converted to the nominal subtype of the formal parameter and assigned\r\n&gt; to the formal.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the passing mode for parameters is described in section 6.2:\r\n\r\n&gt; 6.2 Formal Parameter Modes\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A parameter_specification declares a formal parameter of mode in, in\r\n&gt; out, or out. Static Semantics\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A parameter is passed either by copy or by reference. When a parameter\r\n&gt; is passed by copy, the formal parameter denotes a separate object from\r\n&gt; the actual parameter, and any information transfer between the two\r\n&gt; occurs only before and after executing the subprogram. When a\r\n&gt; parameter is passed by reference, the formal parameter denotes (a view\r\n&gt; of) the object denoted by the actual parameter; reads and updates of\r\n&gt; the formal parameter directly reference the actual parameter object.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A type is a by-copy type if it is an elementary type, or if it is a\r\n&gt; descendant of a private type whose full type is a by-copy type. A\r\n&gt; parameter of a by-copy type is passed by copy, unless the formal\r\n&gt; parameter is explicitly aliased.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; A type is a by-reference type if it is a descendant of one of the\r\n&gt; following: \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a tagged type;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a task or protected type;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; an explicitly limited record type; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a composite type with a subcomponent of a by-reference type;\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; a private type whose full type is a by-reference type. \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  A parameter of a by-reference type is passed by reference, as is an\r\n&gt; explicitly aliased parameter of any type. Each value of a by-reference\r\n&gt; type has an associated object. For a parenthesized expression,\r\n&gt; qualified_expression, or type_conversion, this object is the one\r\n&gt; associated with the operand. For a conditional_expression, this object\r\n&gt; is the one associated with the evaluated dependent_expression.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;  For other parameters, it is unspecified whether the parameter is\r\n&gt; passed by copy or by reference.\r\n\r\nIt appears that your compiler is trying to pass the struct by reference rather than by copy. In C all parameters are passed by copy.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403903/passing-struct-record-from-assembler-to-ada/58419627#58419627","title":"Passing struct/record from assembler to Ada"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2044,"user_id":10975520,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d7bae9130efd0ae9d27353c5b6d35af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DeeDee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10975520/deedee"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2044,"user_id":10975520,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d7bae9130efd0ae9d27353c5b6d35af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"DeeDee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10975520/deedee"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571862969,"last_edit_date":1571862969,"creation_date":1571861197,"answer_id":58530271,"question_id":58403903,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58530271","body_markdown":"Maybe you already solved the problem, but if not, then you might also want to have at look at the `interrupt` function attribute provided by GCC (see [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/x86-Function-Attributes.html#x86-Function-Attributes)).

This is kind of double proxy server feature, i.e. if allowed from both then only web content is allowed, else blocked.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nIf suppose external proxy server in untrust zone with IP 10.123.113.116 and port 3128, then after applying this proxy into a device inside trust zone Internet explorer -&gt; Internet option -&gt; Connections -&gt; LAN Settings -&gt; Proxy server, (given proxy port is allowed through the security policy), all internet gets allowed, i.e. Juniper white list is not checked. According to the “show security flow session” the internet traffic is passed through port 3128 and not by HTTP/HTTPS.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nEven though the relevant security policy includes the proxy port (3128) and the action is permit with application-services -&gt; utm-policy &lt;utm-policy-name&gt;\r\n\r\nMy expectation was, this should apply the utm policy, but it doesn’t.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, we tried **websense-redirect**, where we configured the external proxy server as websense-redirect server host. (Configuration file attached )\r\n\r\nIf we not including this proxy server in web-browser Internet connection LAN setting, we can see that Juniper web filtering works but then it does not check the external proxy server (i.e. sites allowed at UTM but blocked in external proxy server gets allowed). If we include this proxy server in internet option – connection LAN setting, then Juniper web filtering does not get used.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIs this can be done using Enhanced-web filtering (we haven’t

am running my application on HPC systems over ~1000 or so processes, and in a final step I need to send a lot of data to the rank 0 process so it can be written to disk. I am trying to figure out whether I can improve the performance of this step, since currently it is taking me ~2 seconds per process for the rank 0 process to Recv all the data, which makes for ~2000 seconds or 30 minutes for this step.\r\n\r\nCurrently, each process has to send about 200 &quot;batches&quot; of messages each, where each batch of messages consists of 6 sub-messages (containing stuff like a string name, various integers, the data values, stuff like that). So there are lots of messages flying around, and I am wondering how much performance I could expect to gain by packaging these messages together using derived data types rather than Sending each sub-message separately. Does anyone have any idea, or can point me to any benchmarking that anyone has been done?\r\n\r\nI just have no real feeling for the overhead per message in MPI. The amount of data I need to send cannot be changed, but I can package stuff together if it will significantly reduce overheads. However, I don&#39;t want to faff about trying to make derived datatypes work unless there is actually good reason to expect a performance improvement. I am not even sure if this is at all the purpose of derived datatypes, perhaps they are just for convenience and make no difference to performance?\r\n\r\nJust to be a little more explicit: currently I do this:\r\n\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;namebuf[0] , namebuf.size(), MPI_CHAR, r, h5v2_bufname);\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;type       , 1      , r, h5v2_bufdata_type);\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;values[0]  , Npoints, r, h5v2_bufdata_values);\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;pointIDs[0], Npoints, r, h5v2_bufdata_points);\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;ranks[0]   , Npoints, r, h5v2_bufdata_ranks);\r\n    myComm.Send(&amp;valid[0]   , Npoints, r, h5v2_bufdata_valid);\r\n\r\n(where myComm is an object wrapping the MPI C API, and Send is just a fairly thin wrapper of MPI_Send. The other details don&#39;t really matter). And I am wondering if I can expect to improve performance much by packaging these 6 messages into one using derived datatypes.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403896/mpi-performance-multiple-messages-vs-derived-data-types","title":"MPI performance: multiple messages VS derived data types"},{"tags":["google-api","youtube","youtube-api","youtube-data-api","youtube-analytics-api"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571221852,"post_id":58403895,"comment_id":103165640,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403895/youtube-c-api-daily-limit-exceeded#comment103165640_58403895"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10145757,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-N8Lvi1eBvU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASY/sxJrcTopJxs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anindita Ghatak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10145757/anindita-ghatak"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571248183,"post_id":58403895,"comment_id":103180481,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403895/youtube-c-api-daily-limit-exceeded#comment103180481_58403895"},{"owner":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571249658,"post_id":58403895,"comment_id":103181119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403895/youtube-c-api-daily-limit-exceeded#comment103181119_58403895"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10145757,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-N8Lvi1eBvU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASY/sxJrcTopJxs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anindita Ghatak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10145757/anindita-ghatak"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571343175,"post_id":58403895,"comment_id":103219857,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403895/youtube-c-api-daily-limit-exceeded#comment103219857_58403895"},{"owner":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571853177,"post_id":58403895,"comment_id":103381093,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403895/youtube-c-api-daily-limit-exceeded#comment103381093_58403895"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":10145757,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-N8Lvi1eBvU0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASY/sxJrcTopJxs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anindita Ghatak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10145757/anindita-ghatak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51973,"user_id":1841839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZyKjr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DaImTo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1841839/daimto"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571221040,"creation_date":1571182821,"last_edit_date":1571221040,"question_id":58403895,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403895","body_markdown":"We are getting the following errors -\r\n\r\n&gt; {&quot;Google.Apis.Requests.RequestError\\r\\nDaily Limit Exceeded.

I can run cgi perl scripts without perl modules from localhost/cgi-bin/&lt;program.cgi or program.pl&gt; successfully. I can run perl scripts WITH &#39;use HTML::Template&#39; from the command line with ./&lt;program&gt; with perfect HTML output BUT, AND THIS IS THE PROBLEM I cannot run these from localhost either

looks like you&#39;re trying to display the database in a table. I recommend using a [`QSqlDatabase`][1] to create a connection to the database (it does support an SQLite driver). Using this instead of `sqlite3` allows for better integration with the PyQt5 framework. Specifically, it can be easily hooked up with a [`QSqlTableModel`][2] and then displayed with a [`QTableView`][3]. For this approach, I suggest you familiarise yourself with [model/view programming][4].

you&#39;re applying the `keydown` event handler to the entire document, the best way to handle this is to diffuse the function based upon what element initiated the event. You can find this out by using `event.target`\r\n\r\nCombining this with `HTMLElement.prototype.matches` can allow you to avoid elements that match a `selector`, for instance any `input` elements.\r\n\r\n      if(e.target.matches(&quot;input&quot;)) return;\r\n\r\n---\r\nExample:\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function keyboardShortcuts(e){\r\n            \r\n      //Do some stuff when keyboard keys are pressed\r\n      if(e.target.matches(&quot;input&quot;)) return;\r\n      switch(e.code){\r\n      \r\n        case &#39;KeyJ&#39;:\r\n          console.log(&#39;KeyJ&#39;);\r\n          break;\r\n        \r\n        //...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    document.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;,keyboardShortcuts);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;h3&gt; Will Escape Custom KeyDown &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n    &lt;input id=&quot;search&quot; placeholder=&quot;search...&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr /&gt;\r\n    &lt;h3&gt; Will Trigger Custom KeyDown &lt;/h3&gt; \r\n    &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr/&gt;\r\n  &lt;small&gt; Pressing &lt;kbd&gt;J&lt;/kbd&gt; will fire &lt;highlight&gt;console.log&lt;/highlight&gt; from Custom KeyDown Event&lt;/small&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll notice, in the above, `input` doesn&#39;t fire a console log when pressing `j`, but `textarea` still does. \r\n\r\n---\r\nAdding a Class:\r\n---\r\n\r\nI would suggest adding a specific class to your markup that is used for avoiding the global `keydown` handler. For instance something like `defaultKeys` \r\n\r\n---\r\nExample:\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function keyboardShortcuts(e){\r\n            \r\n      //Do some stuff when keyboard keys are pressed\r\n      if(e.target.matches(&quot;.defaultKeys&quot;)) return;\r\n      switch(e.code){\r\n      \r\n        case &#39;KeyJ&#39;:\r\n          console.log(&#39;KeyJ&#39;);\r\n          break;\r\n        \r\n        //...\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    document.addEventListener(&#39;keydown&#39;,keyboardShortcuts);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;h3&gt; Defaulted KeyDown Events &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr/&gt;\r\n    &lt;input id=&quot;search&quot; class=&quot;defaultKeys&quot; placeholder=&quot;search...&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;textarea class=&quot;defaultKeys&quot;&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr/&gt;\r\n    &lt;h3&gt; Custom KeyDown Events &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n    &lt;input /&gt;\r\n    &lt;br&gt;\r\n    &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr/&gt;\r\n    &lt;small&gt; Pressing &lt;kbd&gt;J&lt;/kbd&gt; will fire &lt;highlight&gt;console.log&lt;/highlight&gt; from Custom KeyDown Event&lt;/small&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\nAvoiding Groups of Elements:\r\n---\r\n\r\nIt may be beneficial to avoid entire containers of elements - a.e. if you have a submission form or a player chat, etc.\r\n\r\nYou can utilize the same basic principles, but because currently `selector`s cannot look up the tree( they can&#39;t say *am I a great-grandchild of an element that **does** match `.defaultKeys` ?* ) we have to recursively check up the tree.\r\n\r\nThis is done with a simple `do...while` loop that continues until it finds a match for the specified selector OR it hits the `body` tag. \r\n\r\nThe second out( the `body` tag check ) is normally not necessary as `parentElement` should only be able to go up to the `HTML` element, however, when dealing with IFrames, DOMParser, and, in the future, **Realms** - you may have multiple DOMs injected into one another, and therefore, multiple `body` tags. \r\n\r\nBasically, we simply want to give a for-sure recursive out when it reaches the top of the **current** DOM. \r\n    \r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    function keyboardShortcuts(e) {\r\n    // get init element and set default flag\r\n      let element = e.target,\r\n        useDefault = false;\r\n\r\n    // if this element has defaultKeys class\r\n    // OR if any parent element has defaultKeys class\r\n    // set default flag to true\r\n\r\n      do {\r\n        if (element.matches(&quot;.defaultKeys&quot;)) {\r\n          useDefault = true;\r\n          break;\r\n        }\r\n        if ( element.tagName === &quot;BODY&quot; ) break;\r\n      } while ((element = element.parentElement));\r\n\r\n    // if flag is true, escape function\r\n      if (useDefault) return;\r\n\r\n    // check for custom key events\r\n        switch (e.code) {\r\n          case &quot;KeyJ&quot;:\r\n            console.log(&quot;KeyJ&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    document.addEventListener(&quot;keydown&quot;, keyboardShortcuts);\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;group&quot; class=&quot;defaultKeys&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;h3&gt; These elements are in the same parent div &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n      &lt;input /&gt;\r\n      &lt;br/&gt;\r\n      &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n      \r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;h3&gt; Outside of Group &lt;/h3&gt;\r\n    &lt;textarea&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n---\r\nConclusion\r\n---\r\n\r\nHope this helps! **Happy coding!**","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403876/javascript-keydown-function-conflict-on-input-focus/58404018#58404018","title":"Javascript keydown function conflict on input focus"}],"owner":{"reputation":1711,"user_id":9280523,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KlxLV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jakub Muda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9280523/jakub-muda"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58404018,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571186494,"creation_date":1571182687,"question_id":58403876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403876","body_markdown":"How to prevent keydown event when input is focused?\r\n\r\nI have a function that assigns some action to keyboard keys (mainly player control), but when using `&lt;input&gt;` all assigned keys trigger that action as well.

We would like to start testing in Chrome, which is the only other browser that we have in our PROD environment (Firefox is only available in DEV). \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there are two major hurdles that we need to overcome:\r\n\r\n - First, we don&#39;t have local admin rights on our DEV machines (nevermind PROD). Our supervisor does, and is more than happy to help us run an application as admin, but this is obviously very tedious for everyone involved, and not a good long-term solution.\r\n - Second, our Chrome installation, which mimics the one in PROD, is locked down, to the point where we cannot run it in Developer Mode (i.e. we can&#39;t inspect HTML), and more importantly, we cannot install Chrome extensions. Since RFT requires an extension to run, this is obviously very problematic.\r\n - Needless to say, we&#39;ve been pushing to switch to Selenium, but management doesn&#39;t want to rock the boat too much, so for now we&#39;re stuck with RFT no matter how awful it is. \r\n\r\nWithout the extension, I&#39;ve been able to launch Chrome with RFT, using methods such as startApp() and even startBrowser(). Unfortunately, it takes around 1.5 minutes for RFT to detect that the application has started (despite the fact that Chrome only takes a second to launch), and once it does, I can&#39;t get RFT to recognize Chrome and allow me to access its HTML.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried stuff like:\r\n```\r\nProcessTestObject pto = startBrowser(&quot;Chrome&quot;, url&quot;);\r\ngetRootObject().enableForTesting((int) pto.getProcessId()); //casting to INT seems to be the only way to get this to return TRUE\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I have very little experience with RFT, and documentation/guides are very scarce. However, from what I&#39;ve observed in our codebase, I should be able to do something like:\r\n```\r\nBrowserTestObject bto = new BrowserTestObject(pto);\r\n```\r\nFrom what I understand, if indeed I had the right process, the BrowserTestObject would enable me to then find() HTML elements.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, even if ```root.enableForTesting()``` returns true, the BrowserTestObject ends up being null, which tells me that either I&#39;m targeting the wrong Chrome process (though I have no clue how to find the correct one), or I&#39;m overlooking something else. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried mapping Chrome as an Application instead of a browser, but I still run into the same problem. I simply don&#39;t understand what RFT is doing under the hood to map objects, and all my attempts to figure it out (debugging, printing off child objects) haven&#39;t paid off.\r\n\r\nI should also note that I got my supervisor to install the Chrome extension for me today, but this still failed. Even if I run RFT as an admin (which also launches Chrome as admin), RFT cannot enable Chrome as a browser environment, because it seems that Chrome is blocking the java application that RFT uses to interact with it. As a result, I can launch Chrome, and the extension itself seems to work, but I&#39;m still unable to interact with Chrome. For example, if I try to map Chrome to the Object Map, the mapping tool will highlight elements for about a second, then hang for at least 5 minutes before finally throwing an exception and failing. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there&#39;s a way to map Chrome as a TestObject in such a way as to allow us to access its HTML? How can I tell which of Chrome&#39;s processes I should use (assuming there&#39;s a single one that would enable me to do everything)? \r\n\r\nHell, does anyone know where I could find a decent RFT tutorial?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403863/running-rft-with-chrome-without-extension-admin-rights","title":"Running RFT with Chrome without extension/admin rights"},{"tags":["linux","shell","perl","unix","aix"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11193,"user_id":9952196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10216835866235879/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shawn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9952196/shawn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571184198,"creation_date":1571184198,"answer_id":58404038,"question_id":58403859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404038","body_markdown":"In awk;\r\n\r\n    awk -v newval=&quot;$NEW_VAL_2&quot; -v i=&quot;$i&quot; &#39;\r\n      BEGIN{OFS=&quot;\\t&quot;}\r\n      $1 == i { $2 = newval } 1&#39; $FILE &gt; newfile\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSee [How do I use shell variables in an awk script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19075671/how-do-i-use-shell-variables-in-an-awk-script) for more about `-v` and why it&#39;s better than trying to insert variables in the middle of a script string.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403859/how-to-search-and-replace-a-value-in-a-particular-column-in-unix/58404038#58404038","title":"How to search and replace a value in a particular column in unix"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":150,"user_id":967621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zycpi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Timur Shtatland","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/967621/timur-shtatland"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571237739,"creation_date":1571237739,"answer_id":58416255,"question_id":58403859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58416255","body_markdown":"Here is a perl one-liner solution.

(similarly just a state change with the benefit of keeping track of history ). Backend is fully protected with auth tokens so no need to worry about that.\r\n\r\nMy strategy below will handle these cases:\r\n\r\n - User types in or app navigates to `/company` ( app will pre fetch &gt; get first company by default &gt; navigate to `/company/{id}`\r\n - User types in or app navigates to `/company/{id}` ( app will pre-fetch &gt; navigate to `/company/{id}` &gt; component triggered by that route will check validity of id else navigate to 404 )\r\n\r\nThe strategy I created was,\r\n\r\n - Create a component that will load up a loading screen by default and prefetch the said companies. \r\n - Call the said component in the `pages` folder as the default, in my case, `/company` should be `pages &gt; company.js` or `pages &gt; company &gt; index.js`\r\n - If the prefetch is successful, navigate to `/company/{id}` which is the child of the said component, which is a purely client route.\r\n - make sure `gatsby-node.js` have the necessary `createPages` definition to allow client routing for everything `/company/*`\r\n - manually check if the current location is `/company` to deny redirection to capture the second case when user types in `/company/{id}`\r\n\r\nBetter if I show the code, ignore my custom built in hooks.\r\n\r\n`useRequest` just gives an axios class, with the `true` parameter telling it&#39;s an authenticated required request. \r\n`useApi` just gives a handy (async-await) function that includes `dispatch` for the redux states and calling the api itself. I&#39;m using thunk, so `success` and `error` are standard.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst CompanyDefault = ({location}) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n  const [loading, toggle] = useState(true)\r\n\r\n  const request = useRequest(true)\r\n  const companyApi = useApi(request, getCompanies)\r\n  const companyState = useSelector(({company}) =&gt; company)\r\n  const redirectToCompany = async () =&gt; await navigate(clientRoutes.COMPANY(companyState.data[0].id))\r\n\r\n  const fetchCompanies = async () =&gt; {\r\n    await companyApi()\r\n    toggle(false)\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  useEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n    if(companyState.data.length === 0){\r\n      fetchCompanies()\r\n    } \r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n  if(loading){\r\n    return &lt;Loading /&gt;\r\n  }\r\n  else if(companyState.error || companyState.data.length === 0){\r\n    return &lt;Error callApi={companyApi} /&gt;\r\n  }\r\n  else if(companyState.success &amp;&amp; (location.pathname === &quot;/company&quot; || location.pathname === &quot;/company/&quot;)){\r\n    redirectToCompany()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    &lt;Router&gt;\r\n      &lt;Company path=&quot;company/:companyId/*&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default CompanyDefault\r\n```\r\n\r\nThus, the company module will be just\r\n```\r\nconst Company = ({companyId}) =&gt; (\r\n    // you now have companyId! \r\n    // do magic here, and check if that company id is valid.\r\n    &lt;Router&gt;\r\n      &lt;Main path=&quot;/&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Summary path=&quot;/&quot; /&gt;\r\n        .... other dashboard routes\r\n      &lt;/Main&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHopefully this is cleaner.

(Because MIPS doesn&#39;t have a reg+reg addressing mode, only `reg+imm16`).  But then we wouldn&#39;t be taking advantage of the imm16 in the load at all.\r\n\r\nWe can do better by using the low part of the offset as the immediate in the load, only using 2 extra instructions instead of 3.  Compilers know this trick so it&#39;s easy to show an example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchar foo(char *p) {\r\n    return p[0x123456];\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\ncompiles with [MIPS gcc5.4 on the Godbolt compiler explorer][1] to this asm:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# gcc5.4 -O3 -fno-delayed-branch\r\nfoo:\r\n        li      $2,1179648              # 0x120000\r\n        addu    $4,$4,$2\r\n        lb      $2,13398($4)            # 0x3456($4)\r\n        j       $31\r\n        nop\r\n```\r\n\r\n`$4` is `$a0`, `$2` is `$v0`.  So this is doing `reg += %hi(0x123456)` with lui / addu, then using `%lo(0x123456)` as an offset to that.\r\n\r\nA similar trick should be possible if you used a static array and a register index, but that&#39;s not what GCC actually does.  Probably because it doesn&#39;t know if the low 16 of the static address will have its high bit set or not, so sign-extension creates a possible off-by-one for the upper half of the address.  Maybe there&#39;s no relocation type that will account for that and adjust the `%hi()` part according to the high bit of the `%lo()` part, making this optimization impossible :/\r\n\r\nI used `char` so C wouldn&#39;t scale my index: array index = byte offset because `sizeof(char) = 1`.  `lb` is a sign-extending load into a word register because that&#39;s how MIPS&#39;s calling convention works for narrow args.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/#g:!((g:!((g:!((h:codeEditor,i:(j:1,lang:c%2B%2B,source:&#39;char+foo(char+*p)+%7B+return+p%5B0x123456%5D%3B%7D%0A%0Achar+arr%5B1024%5D%3B%0Achar+idxarr(int+idx)+%7B+return+arr%5Bidx%5D%3B+%7D&#39;),l:&#39;5&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;C%2B%2B+source+%231&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),k:45.96238980113961,l:&#39;4&#39;,m:100,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,s:0,t:&#39;0&#39;),(g:!((h:compiler,i:(compiler:mips5,filters:(b:&#39;0&#39;,binary:&#39;1&#39;,commentOnly:&#39;0&#39;,demangle:&#39;0&#39;,directives:&#39;0&#39;,execute:&#39;1&#39;,intel:&#39;0&#39;,libraryCode:&#39;1&#39;,trim:&#39;1&#39;),lang:c%2B%2B,libs:!(),options:&#39;-xc+-O3+-fno-delayed-branch+-Wall&#39;,source:1),l:&#39;5&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;MIPS+gcc+5.4+(Editor+%231,+Compiler+%231)+C%2B%2B&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),header:(),k:54.0376101988604,l:&#39;4&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,s:0,t:&#39;0&#39;)),l:&#39;2&#39;,n:&#39;0&#39;,o:&#39;&#39;,t:&#39;0&#39;)),version:4","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403796/mips-clarification-on-load-store-word-base-offset/58421197#58421197","title":"MIPS: Clarification on Load/Store word base + offset"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9443218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"CurrentlyAnonymous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9443218/currentlyanonymous"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9443218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"CurrentlyAnonymous","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9443218/currentlyanonymous"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571258451,"creation_date":1571182071,"last_edit_date":1571253936,"question_id":58403796,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403796","body_markdown":"I am currently learning MIPS and would like some clarification on store/load word. \r\n\r\nis:\r\n\r\n    sw $t0, 4($s0) \r\nthe same as \r\n\r\n    addi $s0, $s0, 4 # offsets are in bytes/word 8*4*4\r\n    sw   $t0, 0($s0)\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I understand the offsets are 16 bits signed immediates.

Branch names move and change over time; commit hash IDs do not.  Any time you want to be totally specific about some particular commit, use its hash ID.\r\n\r\nIt might be nice if the sparse checkout file could be based on the commit, but it can&#39;t—at least not easily.  You could:\r\n\r\n * put a file into the commit itself, or some dedicated commit-or-branch;\r\n * extract the desired sparse-checkout file from the commit (e.g., &lt;code&gt;git show *commit-specifier*:*path*&lt;/code&gt;);\r\n * write its contents into `$(git rev-parse --git-dir)/info/sparse-checkout`; and\r\n * run the desired checkout\r\n\r\nwith, perhaps, a fall-back default sparse-checkout file if the file does not exist in the given commit.\r\n\r\nSince commit hash IDs uniquely identify the correct commit, one approach to putting the file into a dedicated branch would be:\r\n\r\n * choose a branch name, e.g., `sparse-info`\r\n * use the various plumbing tools (or, easier, `git worktree add`) to create an area in which these files will live;\r\n * name the files by commit hash ID.\r\n\r\nThen to add a new file, you&#39;d maneuver to the right place, link or copy the sparse checkout data, `git add` the file, and `git commit` the result.\r\n\r\nOr, you could do all this without a branch, with just a dedicated work-area outside your normal work-tree.\r\n\r\nFinally, consider writing your own format for your sparse checkout file, and a filter.  Then it&#39;s just a matter of running your filter-generator to create the desired `$GIT_DIR/info/sparse-checkout` contents.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403767/git-sparse-checkout-with-multiple-repositories/58404459#58404459","title":"git sparse checkout with multiple repositories"}],"owner":{"reputation":905,"user_id":1242581,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/55b8af0768db973f3c41e15b8841c6ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rupert160","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1242581/rupert160"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571188573,"creation_date":1571181843,"question_id":58403767,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403767","body_markdown":"I am wanting to create a project that borrows from two repositories, sparsely checked out.

A `500` code means there is an &quot;internal server error&quot;. So you should really look at your server code and figure out how to safeguard against unexpected input so that it won&#39;t error and/or crash but instead return code `400` which is &quot;bad request&quot;.\r\n\r\nSo the question becomes, what about your frontend code is causing a malformed server request?\r\n\r\nI suspect that you&#39;re trying to use `setValu()` (which is a React hook) the same way one might use a traditional `setState` call in a class component. However, they behave quite differently.\r\n\r\nIn a class component, `setState` performs a &quot;shallow merge&quot; of the old state and the new state. So if you did:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsetState({\r\n  texterror: {\r\n    status: true, \r\n    text: &#39;it be broke yo&#39;\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf would find only the field `texterror` on the state object and update that.\r\n\r\nHowever, React hooks work differently. `useState()` creates a single atomic value, and when you call `setValu()` it _complete replaces the previous value_ stored in `val`.\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  const [val, setValu] = useState({\r\n    email: &#39;example@example.com&#39;,\r\n    password: &#39;password&#39;,\r\n    texterror: {\r\n      status: false,\r\n      text: &#39;&#39;\r\n    },\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // val is now an object with &#39;email&#39;, &#39;password&#39;, and &#39;texterror&#39; fields\r\n\r\n  \r\n  setValu({\r\n    texterror: {\r\n      status: true, \r\n      text: &#39;it be broke yo&#39;\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  // val is now an object with only a &#39;texterror&#39; field\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn your code when you are using `setValu` you are wholly replacing the value of `val` to something that doesn&#39;t have an email or password field, which when sent to the server causes an internal server error.

I deal with the result in a useEffect() call which sets the state when it receives new data. It&#39;s fairly simple.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that while it works very well for one request at a time, it has a single isLoading state and a single result state, which is no good if it&#39;s called before the previous call is finished. Let&#39;s say my user sending a message to his friends and the UI shows a list of friends with a &quot;send message&quot; button next to each name, they might click 3 buttons and make 3 calls in quick succession. We then have a race condition to see which one sets the result first.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m used to imperative programming with promises, in my old Angular code the button click would call an event handler which would call the api and the promise .then() would then deal with the result. This could happen 100 times simultaneously and each one would resolve seperately and then update the UI. \r\n\r\nSo my question is, is there an idiomatic way of doing this declaratively using react hooks so that I can fire off multiple requests and deal with the loading/result/errors separately?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403741/simultaneous-async-api-calls-in-react-hooks","title":"Simultaneous async API calls in react hooks"},{"tags":["android","security","kotlin","mobile","safetynet"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":398,"user_id":610837,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d704c9e7aea3a7acff32339412c74c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sb_269","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/610837/sb-269"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571189962,"creation_date":1571189962,"answer_id":58404600,"question_id":58403739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58404600","body_markdown":"Found my issue!\r\n\r\nFor anyone using &#39;App signing by Google Play&#39;, make sure you add the SHA-1 provided by Google Play to the API restrictions in the API Console.\r\n\r\nYou should find this in &#39;App Signing&#39; in the app on the Play Developer Console.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403739/safety-net-api-error-when-downloaded-from-play-store/58404600#58404600","title":"Safety net Api Error when downloaded from play store"}],"owner":{"reputation":398,"user_id":610837,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5d704c9e7aea3a7acff32339412c74c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sb_269","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/610837/sb-269"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571189962,"creation_date":1571181604,"question_id":58403739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403739","body_markdown":"I have implemented a SafetyNet attest check when launching the app. It works fine when I run the release version from Android studio and detects (for eg.) the emulator from the device correctly.
