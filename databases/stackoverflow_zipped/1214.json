It&#39;s built in Kotlin, and available at `//java/fr/enoent/phosphorus` in my repo.\r\n\r\nI want to write a rule that tests that a file generated by something is identical to the reference file already present in the repository. I tried something with `ctx.actions.run`, the problem being that my rule, having `test = True` set, needs to return an executable _built by that rule_ (so not a tool provided to the rule). I then tried to wrap it in a shell script following the [example][1], like this:\r\n```\r\ndef _phosphorus_test_impl(ctx):\r\n    output = ctx.actions.declare_file(&quot;{name}.phs&quot;.format(name = ctx.label.name))\r\n    script = phosphorus_compare(\r\n        ctx,\r\n        reference = ctx.file.reference,\r\n        comparison = ctx.file.comparison,\r\n        out = output,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    ctx.actions.write(\r\n        output = ctx.outputs.executable,\r\n        content = script,\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    runfiles = ctx.runfiles(files = [ctx.executable._phosphorus_tool, ctx.file.reference, ctx.file.comparison])\r\n    return [DefaultInfo(runfiles = runfiles)]\r\n\r\nphosphorus_test = rule(\r\n    _phosphorus_test_impl,\r\n    attrs = {\r\n        &quot;comparison&quot;: attr.label(\r\n            allow_single_file = [&quot;.phs&quot;],\r\n            doc = &quot;File to compare to the reference&quot;,\r\n            mandatory = True,\r\n        ),\r\n        &quot;reference&quot;: attr.label(\r\n            allow_single_file = [&quot;.phs&quot;],\r\n            doc = &quot;Reference file&quot;,\r\n            mandatory = True,\r\n        ),\r\n        &quot;_phosphorus_tool&quot;: attr.label(\r\n            default = &quot;//java/fr/enoent/phosphorus&quot;,\r\n            executable = True,\r\n            cfg = &quot;host&quot;,\r\n        ),\r\n    },\r\n    doc = &quot;Compares two files, and fails if they are different.&quot;,\r\n    test = True,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n(`phosphorus_compare` is just a macro generating the actual command.)\r\n\r\nHowever, this approach has two issues:\r\n\r\n - The output can&#39;t be declared this way. It&#39;s not linked to any action (and Bazel is complaining about it). Maybe I don&#39;t really need to declare an output for a test? Does Bazel make anything in the test folder available when the test fails?\r\n - The runfiles necessary to run the tool don&#39;t seem to be available when the test runs:\r\n`java/fr/enoent/phosphorus/phosphorus: line 359: /home/kernald/.cache/bazel/_bazel_kernald/58c025fbb926eac6827117ef80f7d2fa/sandbox/linux-sandbox/1979/execroot/fr_enoent/bazel-out/k8-fastbuild/bin/tools/phosphorus/tests/should_pass.runfiles/remotejdk11_linux/bin/java: No such file or directory`\r\n\r\nOverall I feel like using a shell script is just adding an unnecessary indirection, and losing some context (e.g. tools&#39; runfiles). Ideally, I would just use `ctx.actions.run` and rely on its return code, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be an option as a test apparently needs to generate an executable. What would be the correct approach to write such a rule?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/bazelbuild/examples/blob/master/rules/test_rule/line_length.bzl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253616/how-to-write-a-bazel-test-rule-using-a-provided-tool-rather-than-a-rule-built-on","title":"How to write a Bazel test rule using a provided tool rather than a rule-built one?"},{"tags":["python","list"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3180,"user_id":308565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AuxY1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nagaraj Tantri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/308565/nagaraj-tantri"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570326169,"post_id":58253609,"comment_id":102877137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253609/i-want-to-create-a-list-that-will-have-all-odd-numbers-replaced-with-a-string#comment102877137_58253609"},{"owner":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570326638,"post_id":58253609,"comment_id":102877188,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253609/i-want-to-create-a-list-that-will-have-all-odd-numbers-replaced-with-a-string#comment102877188_58253609"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":11783731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3B_GP4c2BbQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGmE/8SYMGgq9jCk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"brunoluvizotto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11783731/brunoluvizotto"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570326239,"creation_date":1570326239,"answer_id":58253630,"question_id":58253609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253630","body_markdown":"The problem is that the w = w+1 line should be outside your &quot;else&quot; so that for every iteration of the while loop the variable would be incremented.\r\n\r\n```\r\nw = 0\r\nx = []\r\n\r\n  while w &lt; 100:\r\n        if w % 2 != 0:\r\n            x.append(&#39;boss&#39;)\r\n        else:\r\n            x.append(w)\r\n        w = w+1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy the way, you could use list comprehension to do that easily (this code generates exactly the same list):\r\n```\r\nx = [val if not val % 2 else &#39;boss&#39; for val in range(100)]\r\n\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253609/i-want-to-create-a-list-that-will-have-all-odd-numbers-replaced-with-a-string/58253630#58253630","title":"i want to create a list that will have all odd numbers replaced with a string"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":291,"user_id":12066865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD0ZXFoG7UWyscuFNUTe3k6LLZbeVw5o8hVOIbDZw=k-s128","display_name":"Faran 2007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12066865/faran-2007"},"last_editor":{"reputation":291,"user_id":12066865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD0ZXFoG7UWyscuFNUTe3k6LLZbeVw5o8hVOIbDZw=k-s128","display_name":"Faran 2007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12066865/faran-2007"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570326710,"last_edit_date":1570326710,"creation_date":1570326336,"answer_id":58253640,"question_id":58253609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253640","body_markdown":"Let me fix your code (`while` statement)\r\n```\r\nw = 0\r\nx = []\r\n\r\nwhile w &lt; 100:\r\n      if w % 2 != 0:\r\n          x.append(&#39;boss&#39;)\r\n      else:\r\n          x.append(w)\r\n      w = w+1\r\n```\r\nThe error is that `w` is always 1, because \r\n\r\n1. `w` only added by 1 if w is divisible by two.

Basically, the script appends the circle data into circles into an svg with visibility set to none.  The script reveal the circles one by one.\r\n\r\nIn the appending function, I tried using the .lower() function to reverse the order that the circles are appended to the svg because if I were to append in the order that the JSON file is in, each consecutive circle would hide the one below it. But then the animation plots backwards, where the larger circle plots first.\r\n\r\nIn the revealing function, I then tried adding a similar &#39;.lower()&#39; function to the transition method so each consecutive circle would reveal behind the previously revealed circle but then the code breaks.

However returning an non-materialized collection using only in-memory objects is fine (such as an enumerator over `enum` values to get `SelectListItem` objects):\r\n\r\nSpecifically, change this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIEnumerable&lt;ReportContractVM&gt; result = contracts.Select(\r\n            x =&gt; new ReportContractVM\r\n                     {\r\n                       ContactId = x.ContractId,\r\n                       ContractName = x.ContractName\r\n                     }\r\n            );\r\n```\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nList&lt;ReportContractVM&gt; list = contracts\r\n    .Select( x =&gt; new ReportContractVM { ContractId = x.ContractId, ContractName = x.ContractName  } )\r\n    .ToList();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, change your `ActionResult&lt;T&gt;` to use `IReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt;` instead of `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` which will help ensure you always return a materialized list instead of a possibly non-materialized enumerator:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SomeController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    public ActionResult&lt;IReadOnlyList&lt;ReportContractVM&gt;&gt; Get()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBTW, I&#39;ve been having problems with `ActionResult&lt;T&gt;` not working well with generics and in `async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;T&gt;&gt;` actions so I personally prefer to do this, but YMMV:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class SomeController : ControllerBase\r\n{\r\n    [Produces( typeof( IReadOnlyList&lt;ReportContractVM&gt; ) )\r\n    public IActionResult Get()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // if async:\r\n\r\n    [Produces( typeof( IReadOnlyList&lt;ReportContractVM&gt; ) )\r\n    public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; Get()\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253566/complex-ienumerable-result-from-linq-select/58253634#58253634","title":"Complex IEnumerable Result from LINQ Select"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":243,"user_id":8636736,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b47e91bc3f3c72ca16f7def7be5e6678?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"danielm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8636736/danielm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570326738,"creation_date":1570326738,"answer_id":58253668,"question_id":58253566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253668","body_markdown":"Basically the output is the concrete enumerable type returned from Select with type parameters referencing both the input and output types.

Unit 1 defines the form and includes many instances of a frame with multiple Tlabel components which is defined in Unit 2.  Unit 3 declares various shared constants and variables which may be used throughout the program. \r\n\r\nWhen the user clicks on one of the frames it sets certain values for variables in Unit 2 and must notify the Form to take actions affecting other cells and components on the form.  Since including Unit 1 in the uses clause of Unit 3 would create a circular reference, I thought sending a message to the Form would be the best option for executing the required actions.\r\n\r\nIn my first attempt I set things up as follows:\r\n\r\n    Unit 1\r\n    Interface\r\n    Uses ..., Winapi.Messages, Unit2, Unit3;\r\n    Type\r\n    Form1 = Class(TForm);\r\n    //List of frames and components\r\n    ...\r\n    private\r\n    ...\r\n        { Private declarations }\r\n    procedure OnDisplayMessage(var Msg: TMessage); message WM_MY_MESSAGE;\r\n    ...\r\n    End;\r\n    \r\n    Implementation\r\n    ...    \r\n    procedure TForm1.OnDisplayMessage(var Msg: TMessage);\r\n    begin\r\n      TakeAction (inputlist); \r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Unit 2  //Common program constants and variables\r\n    Interface\r\n    \r\n    const\r\n      WM_MY_MESSAGE = WM_USER + 100;\r\n     ... \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Unit 3  //Frame component definition\r\n    interface\r\n    Uses ...Winapi.Messages, Unit2;\r\n    \r\n    Types\r\n      TCellFrame = class(TFrame)\r\n        Item1: TLabel;\r\n        Item2: TLabel;\r\n        Item3: TLabel;\r\n        Item4: TLabel;\r\n        Item5: TLabel;\r\n        Item6: TLabel;\r\n        Item7: TLabel;\r\n        Item8: TLabel;\r\n        Item9: TLabel;\r\n        procedure FrameClick(Sender: TObject);\r\n        \r\n    Implementation    \r\n      procedure TCellFrame.FrameClick(Sender: TObject);\r\n      begin\r\n         ...\r\n         SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST,WM_MY_MESSAGE,0,0);\r\n         ...\r\n      end;\r\n  Although the code compiled, The required actions were not executed. I assumed that the message was not being passed to the form so I then tried a substituting the Windows method `AppHookFunction ()` for `OnDisplayMessage ()` as follows:\r\nUnit 1\r\n\r\n    Interface\r\n    Uses ..., Winapi.Messages, Unit2, Unit3;\r\n    Type\r\n    Form1 = Class(Tform;)\r\n    //List of frames and components\r\n    ...\r\n    private\r\n    ...\r\n        { Private declarations }\r\n        function AppHookFunc(var Message : TMessage) : Boolean;    \r\n    ...\r\n    End;\r\n    \r\n    Implementation\r\n    ...    \r\n    function TForm1.AppHookFunc(var Message : TMessage) : Boolean;\r\n    begin\r\n      Result := False;\r\n      if Message.Msg = WM_MY_MESSAGE then begin\r\n        TakeAction (inputlist);\r\n        Result := True;\r\n      end;\r\n    end;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Unit 2  //Common program constants and variables\r\n    Interface\r\n    \r\n    const\r\n      WM_MY_MESSAGE = WM_USER + 100;\r\n     ... \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    Unit 3  //Frame component definition\r\n    interface\r\n    Uses ...Winapi.Messages, Unit2;\r\n    \r\n    Types\r\n      TCellFrame = class(TFrame)\r\n        Item1: TLabel;\r\n        Item2: TLabel;\r\n        Item3: TLabel;\r\n        Item4: TLabel;\r\n        Item5: TLabel;\r\n        Item6: TLabel;\r\n        Item7: TLabel;\r\n        Item8: TLabel;\r\n        Item9: TLabel;\r\n        procedure FrameClick(Sender: TObject);\r\n        \r\n    Implementation    \r\n      procedure TCellFrame.FrameClick(Sender: TObject);\r\n      begin\r\n         ...\r\n         SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST,WM_MY_MESSAGE,0,0);\r\n         ...\r\n      end;\r\nThis options also appears to fail to send the message.  The basic actions work fine when tested so I am fairly certain the failure is in passing the message.  Do I have a misunderstanding in the way messages should pass from frame to Form or is there another approach to implement an action in the form generated by the frame onclick event?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253535/sending-a-message-from-a-frame-to-the-main-form","title":"Sending a message from a frame to the Main Form"},{"tags":["java","android"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3257,"user_id":4828463,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jTteZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Faraz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4828463/faraz"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570325060,"post_id":58253533,"comment_id":102877032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253533/how-to-convert-a-string-to-an-integer-in-java#comment102877032_58253533"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1246,"user_id":9851608,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/480f6b25cbf801d5dbdf465d47a46772?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9851608/zain"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570325154,"creation_date":1570325154,"answer_id":58253560,"question_id":58253533,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253560","body_markdown":"You&#39;ll get `java.lang.NumberFormatException` because you are trying to parse a double value into Integer value; so instead you need to either make your `rate` String holds an integer value like `String rate= &quot;3&quot;;` \r\nor change below line\r\n\r\n    int Newrate= Integer.parseInt(rate);//here is the probleme\r\n\r\ninto\r\n\r\n    double Newrate= Double.parseDouble(rate);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253533/how-to-convert-a-string-to-an-integer-in-java/58253560#58253560","title":"how to convert a string to an integer in java"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19,"user_id":7087401,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-9i1jzdX1ER4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/TRZF0s8meX4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Phil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7087401/phil"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570325271,"creation_date":1570325271,"answer_id":58253567,"question_id":58253533,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253567","body_markdown":"I&#39;m guessing the problem is that rate is essentially a double so Integer.parseInt can&#39;t parse it.

trying to make a 3D camera around a player on a game made with LWJGL3.\r\nWith the mouse scroll wheel you&#39;ll be able to zoom on the player.\r\nHow my function should be ?\r\n\r\nHow I query every event the mousewheel value.\r\n```java\r\n        glfwSetScrollCallback(window.getWindowHandle(), (windowHandle, xoffset, yoffset) -&gt; {\r\n            currentMouseWheel.x = xoffset;\r\n            currentMouseWheel.y = yoffset;\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy function to get Scroll delta based on the previous call :\r\n(PS : input is called each gameLoop)\r\n```java\r\n    public void input(Window window) {\r\n        dMouseWheel.x = 0;\r\n        dMouseWheel.y = 0;\r\n        if (inWindow) {\r\n            double dx = currentMouseWheel.x - previousMouseWheel.x;\r\n            double dy = currentMouseWheel.y - previousMouseWheel.y;\r\n            if (dx != 0) {\r\n                dMouseWheel.x = (float) dx;\r\n            }\r\n            if (dy != 0) {\r\n                dMouseWheel.y = (float) dy;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        previousMouseWheel.x = currentMouseWheel.x;\r\n        previousMouseWheel.y = currentMouseWheel.y;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```xoffset``` and ```yoffset``` are never equals to 0.\r\n\r\nI have to make big impulse on the scrollwheel to see the delta change.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do ?\r\nCan you give me an example ?\r\n\r\nUPDATE : I found out !\r\nHow to do it :\r\n\r\nFirst of all set 2 vectors variables : \r\n```java\r\nprivate Vector2d currentMouseWheel;\r\nprivate Vector2f dMouseWheel;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in your Scroll callback : \r\n```java\r\nglfwSetScrollCallback(window.getWindowHandle(), (windowHandle, xoffset, yoffset) -&gt; {\r\n currentMouseWheel.x = xoffset;\r\n currentMouseWheel.y = yoffset;\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen each game loop iteration, you call a function to update it\r\n```java\r\npublic void input() {\r\n dMouseWheel.x = 0;\r\n dMouseWheel.y = 0;\r\n\r\n if (inWindow) {\r\n dMouseWheel.x = (float) currentMouseWheel.x;\r\n dMouseWheel.y = (float) currentMouseWheel.y;\r\n }\r\n\r\n currentMouseWheel.x = 0;\r\n currentMouseWheel.y = 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you&#39;ll have dMouseWheel with the correct Scroll delta !","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253519/get-delta-mouse-wheel-on-lwjgl3-glfw","title":"Get delta

clearly abusing the disposable pattern.\r\n\r\n`Dispose(bool disposing)` is meant to be called exactly once when the object is no longer needed and will never be used again. It can be either because someone directly called `Dispose()` (which calls `Dispose(true)`), or because the object&#39;s finalizer runs (which calls `Dispose(false)`). Also, as @Dmytro Mukalov pointed out, using managed objects during `Dispose(false)` is unsafe and can lead to hard to debug issues (but it&#39;s only applicable if your object actually has a finalizer).\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re trying to achieve object pooling, I&#39;d suggest you create and then inject a pooling service into this `TCPStream`. It would manage the lifetime of pooled objects and would allow `Rent` and `Return` operations. Then `TCPStream.Dispose()` will `Return` any previously `Rent`ed objects and get rid of its own resources, while the actual pooled objects will only be disposed when the pooling service gets disposed (which you can set up to be at `TCPServer` shutdown). As it stands now, your `TCPStream` has too many responsibilities, which prohibits you from implementing the disposable pattern correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253518/c-dispose-standard-with-certain-situation/58259089#58259089","title":"C# Dispose() standard with certain situation"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12170577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e16d7dd4c3a37e59380c1ee1cd2356e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xiaojiuwo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170577/xiaojiuwo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12170577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e16d7dd4c3a37e59380c1ee1cd2356e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xiaojiuwo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12170577/xiaojiuwo"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":80,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58259089,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570378544,"creation_date":1570324445,"last_edit_date":1570329284,"question_id":58253518,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253518","body_markdown":"We know Dispose(bool disposing) should be protected or private, what if i need to manually release the unmanage resources?

think your program is largely working as you intend, though there are some bugs in it that you will want to address. \r\n\r\nGiven `findfile.c`:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;dirent.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int basic_find(char *str)\r\n    {\r\n        struct dirent *read;\r\n        DIR *dir = NULL;\r\n        dir=opendir(str);\r\n        if(dir == NULL)\r\n            exit(1);\r\n        while((read=readdir(dir)) != NULL )\r\n            {\r\n            if(strcmp(read-&gt;d_name,&quot;.&quot;)!=0)\r\n            {\r\n                strcat(str,&quot;/&quot;);\r\n                strcat(str,read-&gt;d_name);\r\n                if(strcmp(read-&gt;d_name,&quot;.&quot;)!=0 &amp;&amp; strcmp(read-&gt;d_name,&quot;..&quot;)!=0)\r\n                printf(&quot;%s\\n&quot;,str );\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            if(read-&gt;d_type == DT_DIR &amp;&amp; strcmp(read-&gt;d_name, &quot;.&quot;) != 0  &amp;&amp;\r\n                strcmp(read-&gt;d_name, &quot;..&quot;) != 0 )\r\n                {\r\n                basic_find(str);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        closedir(dir);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    int main(int argc, char  *argv[])\r\n    {\r\n        for( int i = 1; i &lt; argc; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            basic_find(argv[i]);\r\n        }\r\n    return 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI created two subdirectories, `test1` and `test2` with two files in the first and one file in the second, then I compiled and ran the program as follows:\r\n\r\n    $ gcc findfile.c -o findfile\r\n    \r\n    $ ls test1\r\n    xxx  yyy\r\n    \r\n    $ ls test2\r\n    aaa\r\n    \r\n    $ ./findfile test1 test2\r\n    test1/../xxx\r\n    test1/../xxx/yyy\r\n    test2/../aaa\r\n    \r\n    $\r\n\r\n... which seems to be almost what you were intending to obtain.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the bugs in this code that you will want to fix: As @Peter notes, concatenating characters to `str` will cause problems due to undefined behaviour, because there may not have been enough space allocated to `str` to add any more characters to it. \r\n\r\nIn addition, within `basic_find()`, the function is progressively concatenating the name of each file it finds onto `str` (first `..` then the first file name in the sub-directory, then the second, and so on), instead of retaining the sub-directory name unchanged and concatenating each file name to the sub-directory name.\r\n\r\nHowever, the loop in `main()` that you were concerned about seems to be working as you intend.

First position the cursor on the first curly brace\r\n\r\n                         Position your cursor at this character\r\n                                     |\r\n                                     v\r\n\r\n    popup.setOnMenuItemClickListener {\r\n        when (it.itemId) {\r\n            R.id.MenuMoreAbout-&gt;{\r\n                requireActivity().openActivity&lt;UIAbout&gt;()\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        true  // Why do I need add &#39;true&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nthen type &lt;kbd&gt;Alt&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; (&lt;kbd&gt;Option&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; for Mac) to bring up the *Quick Fix* menu. Select **Convert to anonymous function**. That will turn the code into the following:\r\n\r\n    popup.setOnMenuItemClickListener(fun(it: MenuItem): Boolean {\r\n        when (it.itemId) {\r\n            R.id.MenuMoreAbout -&gt; {\r\n                requireActivity().openActivity&lt;UIAbout&gt;()\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        return true\r\n    })\r\nwhich is clearer for someone that is new to Kotlin syntax.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen, your `true` expression was the return value of the lambda. In Kotlin, the return value of a lambda is the value of the last expression in the lambda. If you prefer, you can make this explicit by replacing\r\n\r\n    true  // Why do I need add &#39;true&#39;\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    return@setOnMenuItemClickListener true\r\n\r\nin your original code. See official docs for [Return at Labels][1] for more information.\r\n\r\nThe reason a `Boolean` has to be returned is because the lambda is for the following Java interface which is the type of the argument to `setOnMenuItemClickListener(OnMenuItemClickListener)`\r\n```\r\n    public interface OnMenuItemClickListener {\r\n        boolean onMenuItemClick(MenuItem item);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, `onMenuItemClick(MenuItem)` returns a `boolean` (which is converted to `Boolean` in Kotlin). So the lambda must also return a `Boolean`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/returns.html#return-at-labels","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253483/is-there-a-simple-way-to-convert-lambda-into-a-full-expression-in-kotlin-with-an/58254881#58254881","title":"Is there a simple way to convert lambda into a full expression in Kotlin with Android Studio 3.5.1?"}],"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":828896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YA33S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HelloCW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/828896/hellocw"},"last_editor":{"reputation":155,"user_id":828896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YA33S.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HelloCW","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/828896/hellocw"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58254881,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570386310,"creation_date":1570323805,"last_edit_date":1570325130,"question_id":58253483,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253483","body_markdown":"The code in *popup.setOnMenuItemClickListener* is lambda expression, the function of the code is to show a popup menu.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s hard to understand lambda expression sometimes. \r\n\r\nIs there a simple way to convert a lambda into a full expression ?

Just do an algorithm run-through with sample data using a naive approach: copy each element in order.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have the four-element array `int a[4] = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and you want to copy the first three elements to the last three. Ideally, you would end up with `{0, 0, 1, 2}`. How would this (not) work with `std::copy(a, a+3, a+1)`?\r\n\r\n__Step 1:__ Copy the first element `a[1] = a[0];` The array is now `{0, 0, 2, 3}`.\r\n\r\n__Step 2:__ Copy the second element `a[2] = a[1];` The array is now `{0, 0, 0, 3}`.\r\n\r\n__Step 3:__ Copy the third element `a[3] = a[2];` The array is now `{0, 0, 0, 0}`.\r\n\r\nThe result is wrong because you overwrote some of your source data (`a[1]` and `a[2]`) before reading those values. Copying in reverse would work because in reverse order, you would read values before overwriting them.\r\n\r\nSince the result is wrong with one reasonable approach, the standard declared the behavior &quot;undefined&quot;. Compilers wishing to take the naive approach may, and they do not have to account for this case. It is OK to be wrong in this case. Compilers that take a different approach might produce different results, maybe even the &quot;correct&quot; results. That is also OK. Whatever is easiest for the compiler is fine by the standard.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn light of the question&#39;s addendum: please note that this is [undefined behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2397984/undefined-unspecified-and-implementation-defined-behavior). That does not mean the behavior is defined to be contrary to the programmer&#39;s intent. Rather, it means that the behavior is *not defined* by the C++ standard. It is up to each compiler to decide what happens. The result of `std::copy(a, a+3, a+1)` could be anything. You might get the naive result of `{0, 0, 0, 0}`. However, you might instead get the intended result of `{0, 0, 1, 2}`. Other results are also possible. You cannot conclude that there is no undefined behavior simply because you were lucky enough to get the behavior you intended. *Sometimes undefined behavior gives correct results.* (That&#39;s one reason that tracking down bugs related to undefined behavior can be so difficult.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253471/stdcopy-stdcopy-backward-and-overlapping-ranges/58253552#58253552","title":"std::copy, std::copy_backward and overlapping ranges"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":10881416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40069cb51b3d7b68984bfaca6b51d206?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vinod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10881416/vinod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570330375,"post_id":58253799,"comment_id":102877563,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253471/stdcopy-stdcopy-backward-and-overlapping-ranges/58253799#comment102877563_58253799"},{"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":324,"user_id":10881416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40069cb51b3d7b68984bfaca6b51d206?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vinod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10881416/vinod"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570373703,"post_id":58253799,"comment_id":102885531,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253471/stdcopy-stdcopy-backward-and-overlapping-ranges/58253799#comment102885531_58253799"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":318351,"user_id":560648,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pBDFJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lightness Races in Orbit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/560648/lightness-races-in-orbit"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570329023,"creation_date":1570329023,"answer_id":58253799,"question_id":58253471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253799","body_markdown":"The reason is that, in general, copying part of a range to another part of the same range, might require additional (if only temporary) storage, to handle overlaps when copying in sequence from left to right, or from right to left in your second example.\r\n\r\nAs is common with C++, to avoid forcing implementations to take this extreme step, the standard just tells you not to do it by saying the results are undefined.\r\n\r\nThis forces you, in such situations, to be explicit by copying into a fresh piece of memory yourself.\r\n\r\nIt does so while not even requiring the compiler to put any effort into warning or telling you about this, which would also be seen as &quot;too bossy&quot; on the part of the standard.\r\n\r\nBut your assumption that undefined behaviour here results in a copy failure (or a system fault) is also wrong.

However, the undefined behavior is observed only in the case of copy_backward.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/copy\r\n  [2]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/copy_backward\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253471/stdcopy-stdcopy-backward-and-overlapping-ranges","title":"std::copy, std::copy_backward and overlapping ranges"},{"tags":["javascript","math","three.js","geometry"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53967,"user_id":844416,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e39c2364935265593d76247ddc6d07c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"MBo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/844416/mbo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570375557,"post_id":58253469,"comment_id":102886032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253469/how-to-determine-wether-a-point-is-in-between-two-others#comment102886032_58253469"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":9627993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d634d484c22aace30d132d0240e8f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Apbln","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9627993/apbln"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570334091,"post_id":58253574,"comment_id":102877937,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253469/how-to-determine-wether-a-point-is-in-between-two-others/58253574#comment102877937_58253574"},{"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":10678162,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jCQlK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"v-joe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10678162/v-joe"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570352995,"post_id":58253574,"comment_id":102880752,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253469/how-to-determine-wether-a-point-is-in-between-two-others/58253574#comment102880752_58253574"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":141,"user_id":11425325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8WL1o.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11425325/pete"},"last_editor":{"reputation":141,"user_id":11425325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8WL1o.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11425325/pete"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571522224,"last_edit_date":1571522224,"creation_date":1570325389,"answer_id":58253574,"question_id":58253469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253574","body_markdown":"To check, whether C is between A and B, calculate e.g. the vector differences `u=subVectors(pB,pA)` and `v=subVectors(pC,pA)`.

See also [Vector projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_projection):\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction isPointbetweenTwoOthers (pA, pB, pToCheck) {\r\n\r\n    let vAtoB = pB.clone().sub(pA);\r\n    let vAtoC = pToCheck.clone().sub(pA);\r\n    let vBtoC = pToCheck.clone().sub(pB);\r\n\r\n    // fast exit, C can&#39;t be between A and B\r\n    if (nvAtoB.dot(nvAtoC) &lt; 0.0 || nvAtoB.dot(nvBtoC) &gt; 0.0)\r\n       return false;\r\n\r\n    // nearest point X to C on the line A, B\r\n    let X = pA.clone().add( vAtoC.clone().projectOnVector( vAtoB ) );\r\n\r\n    // distance between X and C\r\n    let distXtoC = X.distanceTo( C );\r\n\r\n    let threshold = 1.0; // ???\r\n    return distXtoC &lt; threshold;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis can be simplified further by the [Cross product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product). The magnitude of the cross product of 2 vectors is equal to the area of the parallelogram that the vectors span.  \r\nThis means if the cross product is near to 0.0, then the vectors are parallel and *pC* is on the line from *pA* to *pB*:\r\n\r\n```lang-js\r\nfunction isPointbetweenTwoOthers (pA, pB, pToCheck) {\r\n\r\n    let vAtoB = pB.clone().sub(pA);\r\n    let vAtoC = pToCheck.clone().sub(pA);\r\n    let vBtoC = pToCheck.clone().sub(pB);\r\n\r\n    // fast exit, C can&#39;t be between A and B\r\n    if (nvAtoB.dot(nvAtoC) &lt; 0.0 || nvAtoB.dot(nvBtoC) &gt; 0.0)\r\n       return false;\r\n\r\n    // cross product and area spawned by the normalized vectors B-A and C-A\r\n    let nv = vAtoB.normalize().cross(vAtoC.normalize());\r\n    let area = nv.length();\r\n\r\n    let epsilon = 0.0016; // ???\r\n    return Math.abs(area) &lt; epsilon;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pxrEW.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3s0V5.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253469/how-to-determine-wether-a-point-is-in-between-two-others/58255485#58255485","title":"How to determine wether a point is in between two others?"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":9627993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47d634d484c22aace30d132d0240e8f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Apbln","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9627993/apbln"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64582,"user_id":5577765,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LoGpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rabbid76","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5577765/rabbid76"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58255485,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571522224,"creation_date":1570323507,"last_edit_date":1570356686,"question_id":58253469,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253469","body_markdown":"I made a little function that doesn&#39;t work quite right...\r\n\r\n\r\n    function isPointbetweenTwoOthers (pA, pB, pToCheck) {\r\n        var pApB = new THREE.Vector3();\r\n        pApB.subVectors(pA,pB).normalize();\r\n\r\n        var pBpA = new THREE.Vector3();\r\n        pBpA.subVectors(pB,pA).normalize();\r\n\r\n        var pA_pToCheck = new THREE.Vector3();\r\n        pA_pToCheck.subVectors(pA,pToCheck).normalize();\r\n\r\n        var pB_pToCheck = new THREE.Vector3();\r\n        pB_pToCheck.subVectors(pB,pToCheck).normalize();\r\n\r\n        if(pA_pToCheck.dot(pApB) &lt;0 || pB_pToCheck.dot(pBpA) &lt;0)\r\n        return false\r\n        else return true\r\n    }\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?

You can verify this by using else in below if statement of your code\r\n\r\n        if (intent.resolveActivity(getPackageManager()) != null) {\r\n            startActivity(intent);\r\n\r\n        } else {\r\n            Log.d(&quot;Log_TAG&quot;, &quot;No activity on the device (email app) that can handle my intent&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need further help\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253451/email-intent-did-not-launch-when-its-clicked/58253530#58253530","title":"email intent did not launch when its

it possible to send and receive data between multiple android devices via broadcasting over wifi, without establishing p2p connection?\r\n\r\n - Our professor asked us to design a wireless network system in which you broadcast a message within your android phone, and the other android phones nearby receive it and broadcast it again, so the other phones can receive it, and it continues like that.\r\n - In this way, for example, when someone writes a message in a classroom or caf&#233;, everyone will be able to receive and rebroadcast it (like an adhoc network).\r\n  - Although my professor believes it can be achievable, I didn&#39;t find anything online like this kind of android network system.\r\n  - So my question again, is it possible to do something as described?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253438/broadcasting-a-message-using-wifi-direct-android","title":"Broadcasting a message using wifi direct

And, indeed `numpy` arrays can only have 32 independent dimensions. \r\n\r\nBut even if you reduced the list you&#39;re supplying to `ndarray()` to just 32 numbers, you&#39;d still have a problem, because your 32 numbers are floating-point values, and `ndarray()` is expecting integral counts. (You&#39;d get a `TypeError`.)\r\n\r\nAlong the approach you&#39;re trying to take – which isn&#39;t quite optimal as we&#39;ll get to below – you really want to create a *single vector* of 1000 floating-point dimensions. That is, 1000 cell-like values – **not** `d[0] * d[1] * ... * d[999]` separate cell-like values. \r\n\r\nSo a crude fix along the lines of your initial approach could be replacing your last line with either:\r\n\r\n~~~Python\r\nresult = np.ndarray(len(d))\r\nfor i in range(len(d)):\r\n    result[i] = d[i]\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBut there are many ways to incrementally make this more efficient, compact, and idiomatic – a number of which I&#39;ll mention below, even though the *best* approach, at bottom, makes most of these interim steps unnecessary.\r\n\r\nFor one, instead of that assignment-loop in my code just above, you could use Python&#39;s bracket-indexing assignment option:\r\n\r\n~~~Python\r\nresult = np.ndarray(len(d))\r\nresult[:] = d  # same result as previous 3-lines w/ loop\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBut in fact, `numpy`&#39;s `array()` function can essentially create the necessary `numpy`-native `ndarray` from a given list, so instead of using `ndarray()` at all, you could just use `array()`:\r\n\r\n~~~Python\r\nresult = np.array(d)  # same result as previous 2-lines\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBut further, `numpy`&#39;s many functions for natively working with arrays (and array-like lists) already include things to do averages-of-many-vectors in a single step (where even the looping is hidden inside very-efficient compiled code or CPU bulk-vector operations). For example, there&#39;s a `mean()` function that can average lists of numbers, or multi-dimensional arrays of numbers, or aligned sets of vectors, and so forth.\r\n\r\nThis allows faster, clearer, one-liner approaches that can replace your entire original code with something like:\r\n\r\n~~~Python\r\n# get a list of available word-vetors\r\ndoc = [model[word] for word in text if word in model.vocab]\r\n# average all those vectors\r\nout = np.mean(doc, axis=0)\r\n~~~\r\n\r\n(Without the `axis` argument, it&#39;d average together all individual dimension-values , in all slots, into just one single final average number.)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58253405/gensim-word2vec-model-outputs-1000-dimension-ndarray-but-the-maximum-number-of-n/58261123#58261123","title":"Gensim word2vec model outputs 1000 dimension ndarray but the maximum number of ndarray dimensions is 32 - how?"}],"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":4153995,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OWIKP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Giorgio Ghisotti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4153995/giorgio-ghisotti"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58261123,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570399992,"creation_date":1570322493,"question_id":58253405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58253405","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use [this][1] 1000 dimension wikipedia word2vec model to analyze some documents.\r\n\r\nUsing introspection I found out that the vector representation of a word is a 1000 dimension numpy.ndarray, however whenever I try to create an ndarray to find the nearest words I get a value error:\r\n\r\n    ValueError: maximum supported dimension for an ndarray is 32, found 1000\r\n\r\nand from what I can tell by looking around online 32 is indeed the maximum supported number of dimensions for an ndarray - so what gives?

Not a redirection? And the path should be ignored?\r\n\r\nThis should do, note that I also fixed a couple of other issues with your current setup: \r\n\r\n    RewriteEngine On\r\n    RewriteBase /\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?(.*)\\.php$ /$1 [R=301]\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?system/(.*)$ /000999 [END]\r\n    RewriteRule ^/?(.*)$ /public/$1 [END]\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to start out with a 302 temporary redirection and only change that to a 301 permanent redirection later, once you are certain everything is correctly set up. That prevents caching issues while trying things out...\r\n\r\nIn case you receive an internal server error (http status 500) using the rule above then chances are that you operate a very old version of the apache http server. You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare).
