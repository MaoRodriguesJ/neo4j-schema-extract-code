You forgot `?` in `range-check`.\r\n3. You have extra function call around `(range-check....)` which is definitely wrong since `range-check?` returns a boolean which is not callable. \r\n4. `if` should have then and else branches inside its parentheses,\r\n5. `(cons &#39;((car (func)) (cdr (func))))` is wrong. `cons` consumes two arguments, but you provide one, which is a quoted expression. I assume that they should be `(car (func))` and `(cdr (func))`.\r\n6. If possible, use DrRacket. You can select all and indent, which will reveal some of these mistakes easily.\r\n7. Another way to write `range-check?` more concisely: `(and (&lt; -1 row numrows) (&lt; -1 col numcols))`.\r\n8. You might want to consider calling `func` just once and bind its result to a variable, and use that variable instead. In case `func` is expensive, doing so will make your code more efficient.\r\n9.

Also pagination would work out of the box as well.\r\n\r\nIt was discussed whether it would be a good idea to use the grouping field as a routing key to make sure all top hits were located on the same shard, but in the end this was deemed too big a limitation.\r\n\r\nSo, long story short, with field collapsing there is no such restriction to locate all documents on the same shard because the fetch request (phase 2) will be sent to all shards anyway.\r\n\r\nAs always, the best way is to try it out for yourself and measure the performance.\r\n\r\n * 1 index with 1 shard (with and without routing key)\r\n * 1 index with several shard (with and without routing key)\r\n\r\nMy take is that it would make no big difference, because only the top hits are collapsed and a normal search query (without field collapsing) would go through both query/fetch phases as well anyway.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160149/elasticsearch-is-having-collapsed-documents-on-the-same-shard-improve-performan/58164170#58164170","title":"Elasticsearch: Is having collapsed documents on the same shard improve performance while collapsing?"}],"owner":{"reputation":254,"user_id":2936565,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/61c2fc68a3ff574972785e00b898f2ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rolele","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2936565/rolele"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58164170,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569832352,"creation_date":1569802129,"question_id":58160149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58160149","body_markdown":"Elasticsearch Parent/Child nested relationship impose having the parent and children on the same shard by using the _routing field during ingesting.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if using the same process would provide performance improvement while using the `collapse` feature of elasticsearch or would it make it worst?\r\n\r\nIf we look at both cases:\r\n\r\n1) Routing to the same shard: the shard is able to do the collapsing on its own and return already fully collapsed documents\r\n\r\n2) Document are on many shards: the collapse can only happen later with all shards returning lots of documents that will be collapsed later.\r\n\r\nI do not know if elasticsearch will do the 2nd even though documents where on the same shard.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160149/elasticsearch-is-having-collapsed-documents-on-the-same-shard-improve-performan","title":"Elasticsearch: Is having collapsed documents on the same shard improve performance while collapsing?"},{"tags":["scala"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10015,"user_id":471321,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j2t3q.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steven Wexler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/471321/steven-wexler"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569804356,"creation_date":1569804356,"answer_id":58160314,"question_id":58160147,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160314","body_markdown":"When you groupBy, you lose context of the full set of names.

See https://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/collections/views.html\r\n\r\nval names: Set[String] = sales.view.groupBy(_.name).mapValues(_.head.name).values.toSet\r\n\r\nval salesByMonthByName: Map[String, Set[(String, Double)]] = sales\r\n  .groupBy(_.month)\r\n  .mapValues { monthlySales =&gt;\r\n    val salesByPerson = monthlySales\r\n      .groupBy(_.name)\r\n      .mapValues(singlePersonSales =&gt; singlePersonSales.view.map(_.amt).sum)\r\n    names.map(name =&gt; name -&gt; salesByPerson.getOrElse(name, 0.0))\r\n  }\r\n\r\nsalesByMonthByName.foreach { case (month, salesByName) =&gt;\r\n    salesByName.foreach { case (name, totalSales) =&gt; println(s&quot;$month $name $totalSales&quot;) }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160147/scala-make-groupby-sum-find-columns-with-zeroes/58160314#58160314","title":"SCALA -- Make groupBy + sum find columns with zeroes"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":33340,"user_id":4993128,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SCKPy.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jwvh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4993128/jwvh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569805770,"creation_date":1569805770,"answer_id":58160421,"question_id":58160147,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160421","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s how I&#39;d go about it.\r\n```Scala\r\n//quick lookup of sales totals\r\nval salesMap = sales.groupMapReduce(s =&gt; (s.month,s.name))(_.amt)(_+_)\r\n                    .withDefaultValue(0.0)\r\n\r\n//all months and all names\r\nval (months,names) = sales.foldLeft((Set.empty[String], Set.empty[String])) {\r\n  case ((mons,nams), sale) =&gt; (mons+sale.month, nams+sale.name)\r\n}\r\n\r\n//make report\r\nfor {\r\n  mn &lt;- months\r\n  nm &lt;- names\r\n} println(s&quot;$mn, $nm, ${salesMap((mn,nm))}&quot;)\r\n//1, Bob, 27.0\r\n//1, Frank, 20.0\r\n//1, Joe, 10.0\r\n//2, Bob, 5.0\r\n//2, Frank, 0.0\r\n//2, Joe, 10.0\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160147/scala-make-groupby-sum-find-columns-with-zeroes/58160421#58160421","title":"SCALA -- Make groupBy + sum find columns with zeroes"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12140280"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58160314,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569805770,"creation_date":1569802097,"question_id":58160147,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58160147","body_markdown":"The title of the question is probably confusing, so hopefully my code example will make more sense.\r\n\r\nBut basically, if I was grouping-by a set of values, if that value didn&#39;t appear in the list, it doesn&#39;t get recognized.

Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\n## Modification points:\r\nIn your script, the scripts of `code.gs` and `code2.gs` are used as one project at the script editor. So in your script, there are 2 same functions of `onOpen()` in the project. In this case, only one of them is run. In your case, `onOpen()` of `code2.gs` is run and the error of `ReferenceError: &quot;A&quot; is not defined.` occurs.\r\n\r\n## Modified script:\r\nIf you want to modify your script and you want to work the functions when the Google Document is opened, how about the following modification?\r\n\r\n### 1. Copy and paste the following script to `code.gs` and `code2.gs` of the script editor:\r\n#### code.gs:\r\n\r\n\tvar ui = DocumentApp.getUi();\r\n\tfunction installedOnOpen () {\r\n\t    A = prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;); // or ui.prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;).getResponseText();\r\n\t    sample(A);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n#### code2.gs:\r\n\r\n\tfunction sample (A) {\r\n\t    if (A === &quot;123&quot;) {\r\n\t       ui.alert(&#39;Hello&#39;)\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nOr, if you want to run independently 2 functions, how about the following modification? In this modification, the value is saved using PropertiesService.\r\n\r\n#### code.gs:\r\n\tvar ui = DocumentApp.getUi();\r\n\tfunction installedOnOpen () {\r\n\t    A = prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;); // or ui.prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;).getResponseText();\r\n\t    PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().setProperty(&quot;key&quot;, A);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n#### code2.gs:\r\n\tfunction sample () {\r\n\t    var A = PropertiesService.getScriptProperties().getProperty(&quot;key&quot;);\r\n\t    if (A === &quot;123&quot;) {\r\n\t       ui.alert(&#39;Hello&#39;)\r\n\t    }\r\n\t}\r\nOr, you can also modify as follows. But, in your situation, this might not be required.\r\n\r\n\tfunction installedOnOpen () {\r\n\t  var ui = DocumentApp.getUi();\r\n\t  var A = ui.prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;).getResponseText();\r\n\t  if (A === &quot;123&quot;) {\r\n\t    ui.alert(&#39;Hello&#39;);\r\n\t  }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n### 2. Install OnOpen event trigger:\r\nIn order to run the function of `installedOnOpen` when the Google Document is opened, [please install the OnOpen event trigger to the funciton of `installedOnOpen` as the installable trigger.](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable#managing_triggers_manually)\r\n\r\n### 3. Run script:\r\nIn your case, there are 2 patterns for running script.\r\n\r\n#### Pattern 1:\r\nOpen Google Document.\r\n\r\n#### Pattern 2:\r\nRun `installedOnOpen` at the script editor.\r\n\r\nBy above, `installedOnOpen` is run. And you can see the dialog at Google Document.\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\n- This modification supposes that the function of `prompt()` returns the value of `123` as the string value.\r\n\t- If you cannot provide the script of `prompt()`, as a test case, how about modifying from `prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;);` to `ui.prompt(&#39;Hello&#39;).getResponseText();`?\r\n\r\n## References:\r\n- [Access a variable across multiple script file under a GAS project](https://stackoverflow.com/q/57780760)\r\n\t- Also I think that this thread might be useful for you.\r\n- [Installable Triggers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers/installable)\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood your question and this was not the direction you want, I apologize.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160130/using-a-variable-from-another-script-in-the-same-document-apps-scripting/58160322#58160322","title":"Using a variable from another script in the same document (apps scripting)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1960,"user_id":1393023,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fbHue.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"contributorpw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1393023/contributorpw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569838071,"creation_date":1569838071,"answer_id":58165670,"question_id":58160130,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58165670","body_markdown":"As I can see you define `onOpen` twice.

+ str(rownum))\r\n    variable = pulp.LpVariable(str(variable), lowBound = 0, cat= &#39;Integer&#39;) \r\n    decision_variables.append(variable)\r\n```\r\n&gt;My actual question..\r\n\r\nI want to be able to loop through the pandas dataframe to find all the **TaskFrequency** that happened at a specific hour and then multiply each TaskFrequency by the respective decision variable for each row - the whole expression should be less than or equal to the **TotalTaskatSpecificHour** for a specific hour \r\ne.g. an expression like this for Hour 10 would be: \r\n```\r\n4*x3 + 2*x6 &lt;= 20\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt;So far I have been able to do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nto = &quot;&quot;\r\nfor rownum, row in df_long.iterrows():\r\n    for i, wo in enumerate(decision_variables):\r\n            if rownum == i:\r\n                formula = row[&#39;TaskFrequency&#39;]*wo\r\n    to += formula\r\nprob += to\r\n```\r\nthis gave me: \r\n\r\n```\r\n5*x0 + 8*x1 + 7*x2 + 4*x3 + 6*x4 + 9*x5 + 2*x6 + 1*x7 +3*x8 + 2*x9 + 7*x10\r\n```\r\n&gt;I also tried this: \r\n```\r\nfor rownum, row in df_long.iterrows():\r\n            for i, wo in enumerate(decision_variables):\r\n                 for x,y,z in zip(df_long[&#39;Hour&#39;],df_long[&#39;TypeofTask&#39;],df_long[&#39;TaskFrequency&#39;]):\r\n                           if rownum == i:\r\n                                formula1 = row[&#39;TaskFrequency&#39;]*wo \r\n```\r\nI just get 7*x10\r\n\r\n&gt;what I wish to get is the same expression but for a specific **Hour** instead of the whole thing combined e.g. \r\n&gt;for Hour 10 it should be, \r\n\r\n```\r\n4*x3 + 2*x6 &lt;= 20\r\n```\r\n&gt;for Hour 9 it should be, \r\n```\r\n8*x1 + 6*x4 + 1*x7 + 7*x10 &lt;= 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nI look forward to your suggestions and help. \r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDiva\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160080/conditional-iteration-over-a-pandas-dataframe","title":"Conditional Iteration over a Pandas Dataframe"},{"tags":["javascript","class","object"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1856,"user_id":6692606,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3653dbd72e2fd66e0a741b97aa322e1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ASDFGerte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6692606/asdfgerte"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569801388,"post_id":58160079,"comment_id":102702411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160079/js-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-x-of-undefined-at-object-ball#comment102702411_58160079"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12140236,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HvqaEBnnMnw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reG5dCc0IWRcwnvDffR8TLlacKZCQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12140236/john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569880780,"post_id":58160182,"comment_id":102732245,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160079/js-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-x-of-undefined-at-object-ball/58160182#comment102732245_58160182"},{"owner":{"reputation":44447,"user_id":695364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUNjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/695364/scott-marcus"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12140236,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-HvqaEBnnMnw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reG5dCc0IWRcwnvDffR8TLlacKZCQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12140236/john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569882926,"post_id":58160182,"comment_id":102732754,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160079/js-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-read-property-x-of-undefined-at-object-ball/58160182#comment102732754_58160182"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":44447,"user_id":695364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUNjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/695364/scott-marcus"},"last_editor":{"reputation":44447,"user_id":695364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUNjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/695364/scott-marcus"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569803288,"last_edit_date":1569803288,"creation_date":1569802584,"answer_id":58160182,"question_id":58160079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160182","body_markdown":"The problem is that when you call `requestAnimationFrame` and pass it a reference to `move` as its callback, the `this` binding to your `Ball` instance is lost when the callback is executed.

Here&#39;s my XML code :\r\n\r\n     &lt;fragment\r\n        android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n        android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;\r\n        android:id=&quot;@+id/java_island_map&quot;\r\n        class=&quot;com.google.android.gms.maps.SupportMapFragment&quot;\r\n        android:layout_gravity=&quot;center&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/fragment&gt;\r\n    &lt;ScrollView .... etc\r\n\r\nWhat did I do wrong here? This will help me a lot, as I will do this for other map-based UIs as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160062/getting-a-random-getmapasync-null-pointer-exception","title":"Getting a random getmapASync null pointer exception"},{"tags":["c","encryption","wininet","botnet"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5969,"user_id":1645712,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48781792c1fb7d61086b4fb612938c13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"gusto2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1645712/gusto2"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569833650,"post_id":58160060,"comment_id":102710635,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160060/reverse-transposition-invert-the-byte-order-of-the-binary-of-an-executable-file#comment102710635_58160060"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11619209,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_VdQeppbtVQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAByw/J5WrakmpUZA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daniel Lugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11619209/daniel-lugo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":750,"user_id":3236484,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pc0EZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"yacine benzmane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3236484/yacine-benzmane"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569802347,"creation_date":1569800779,"last_edit_date":1569802347,"question_id":58160060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58160060","body_markdown":"First I have to build the binary (locally) from the hexadecimal character sequence, now with that, I have to invert the order of the bytes e.g: (4A 5A...etc. the new binary will end like 5A 4D).\r\n\r\nFor each file that this function receives, for example, notepad.exe has to create a new file named notepad.exe.crypt without deleting the original one.\r\n\r\nI tried saving the raw file in an array and iterating from the end to the beginning saving the element in the new file, but I wasn&#39;t able to do that if you could give me a hint I&#39;ll be very grateful, \r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160060/reverse-transposition-invert-the-byte-order-of-the-binary-of-an-executable-file","title":"Reverse transposition (invert the byte order of the binary of an executable file)"},{"tags":["android","exoplayer","exoplayer2.x","albumart"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":219,"user_id":3393916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/848d04a4716ec8965b9fec5c590e9000?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"drawk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3393916/drawk"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569811032,"creation_date":1569811032,"answer_id":58160878,"question_id":58160059,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160878","body_markdown":"After poking through the Exoplayer source a bit, here is what I came up with.

the other small array), follow the problem&#39;s rule, A[0] &lt; A[5], A[1] &lt; A[6], ... so this small array satisfy (k=3)\r\n\r\n- The rest of the element go in the second array (which is k=2 in this case), and they will also satisfy the rule for (k=2).\r\n\r\nKeep breaking them down, if the after breaking, (k=1) then return the array, and you can be sure that it&#39;s already sorted.\r\n\r\nThen with 2 smaller already sorted array, just [merge 2 sorted array][100] to combine them.\r\n\r\nHere are my pseudo code :\r\n\r\n    function sortK (A, k) :\r\n        if (k=1)

Your two examples above are different, which is why you get different results. The first applies a transition and animation to a DetailView, then type-erases it with AnyView. The second type-erases a DetailView with AnyView, then applies a transition and animation.\r\n2. Rather that using AnyView and type-erasure, I prefer to encapsulate the conditional logic inside of a `Group` view. Then the type you return is `Group`, which will animate properly.\r\n3. If you wanted different animations on the two possibilities for your subview, you can now apply them directly to `DetailView()` or `Text(&quot;test&quot;)`.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nThe `Group` method will only work with `if`, `elseif`, and `else` statements. If you want to use a switch, you will have to wrap each branch in `AnyView()`. However, this breaks transitions/animations. Using `switch` *and* setting custom animations is currently not possible.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160011/swiftui-add-subview-dynamically-but-the-animation-doesnt-work/58172519#58172519","title":"SwiftUI add subview dynamically but the animation doesn&#39;t work"}],"owner":{"reputation":1139,"user_id":502958,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":52,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6209aa0c26365547453ac9b950c99a1d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"justicepenny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/502958/justicepenny"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":90,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58172519,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569875647,"creation_date":1569799999,"question_id":58160011,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58160011","body_markdown":"I would like to create a view in SwiftUI that add a subview dynamically and with animation.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct ContentView : View {\r\n    @State private var isButtonVisible = false\r\n\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            Toggle(isOn: $isButtonVisible.animation()) {\r\n                Text(&quot;add view button&quot;)\r\n            }\r\n \r\n           if isButtonVisible {\r\n                 AnyView(DetailView())\r\n                      .transition(.move(edge: .trailing))\r\n                      .animation(Animation.linear(duration: 2))\r\n             }else{\r\n                    AnyView(Text(&quot;test&quot;))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe above code works fine with the animation . however when i move the view selection part into a function, the animation is not working anymore (since i want to add different views dynamically, therefore, I put the logic in a function.)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView : View {\r\n    @State private var isButtonVisible = false\r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            Toggle(isOn: $isButtonVisible.animation()) {\r\n                Text(&quot;add view button&quot;)\r\n            }\r\n           \r\n            subView().transition(.move(edge: .trailing))\r\n                     .animation(Animation.linear(duration: 2))   \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n     func subView() -&gt; some View {\r\n         if isButtonVisible {\r\n             return AnyView(DetailView())\r\n         }else{\r\n            return AnyView(Text(&quot;test&quot;))\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nit looks totally the same to me, however, i don&#39;t understand why they have different result.

This is how an Application Programming Interface is **intended** to work.\r\n\r\nIt won&#39;t only prevent situations like this but also will make your code a multitude times more readable and maintainable. \r\n\r\n**And it will make your code much safer too**. You can run multiple statements in a single call only at the expense of the native prepared statements. However virtual this vulnerability is, why taking chances at all?\r\n\r\nWhy not to make a regular SELECT query instead of SET, get the resulting value into a PHP variable and then use it among other variables, just through a placeholder? I don&#39;t see any reason why there should be such a complex way to deal with simple data.\r\n\r\nIn case I failed to convince you, the reason is simple. You are running **two** queries, and the first one doesn&#39;t trigger any insert ids. And obviously, you need this  query&#39;s metadata (errors, affected rows, whatever), not the other one&#39;s first. So you get it. And to get the second&#39;query&#39;s metadata you have to ask a database for it. The process is explained in my article: [Treating PHP delusions - The only proper PDO tutorial: Running multiple queries with PDO](https://phpdelusions.net/pdo#multiquery). Basically `PDOStatement::nextRowset()` is what you need.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58160001/pdo-lastinsertid-failing-due-to-running-multiple-queries-in-a-single-call/58162526#58162526","title":"PDO lastInsertID() failing due to running multiple queries in a single call"}],"owner":{"reputation":970,"user_id":1701789,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44100879aae8f4e8b636af087f3321c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"joshstrike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1701789/joshstrike"},"last_editor":{"reputation":136831,"user_id":285587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uhHvv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Your Common Sense","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/285587/your-common-sense"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58162526,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569825002,"creation_date":1569799803,"last_edit_date":1569824027,"question_id":58160001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58160001","body_markdown":"This is odd.

I created a **new project** with an **Empty Activity** \r\n2. I right-clicked my **app** folder and performed: **New &gt; Fragment &gt; Fragment (Blank)**,  \r\n    - Named it **TestingFragment**  \r\n    - Unchecked &quot;**Include fragment factory methods?**&quot;  \r\n    - Unchecked &quot;**Include interface callbacks?**&quot;  \r\n3. Under **res &gt; layout** I updated the fragment (**fragment_testing**) to recognize it within the **main activity**  \r\n4. I went to the **activity_main.xml** file, added the **FrameLayout** to the layout  \r\n5. I tried to drag the **&lt; fragment &gt;** component to the **FrameLayout**  \r\n6. I receive an error message with just an **OK** button:  \r\n\r\n    No Fragments Found  \r\n    You must first create one or more Fragments in code.  \r\n\r\nMy Best Guess\r\n=\r\nIt appears that my Android studio is not recognizing that I have the fragment code created and just need to add it to the layout.  \r\nPerhaps I need to configure the **Gradle** scripts to be able to find the **TestingFragment** class?\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;ve Tried from Googling Around\r\n=\r\n1. I have installed, uninstalled and re-installed Android Studio using [**Snapcraft**](https://snapcraft.io/android-studio) \r\n2. I have installed, uninstalled and re-installed Android Studio using [**android-studio-ide-191.5791312-linux.tar.gz**](https://developer.android.com/studio#downloads) from the official Android Download site within the **/opt** directory. \r\n3. I have made sure all **plugins** are checked via **File &gt; Settings &gt; Plugins**\r\n4. I have verified that my **Android SDK Location** is pointing to the right folder via **Tools &gt; SDK Manager**.  \r\nUnder **SDK Platforms** the following SDKs are installed and checked:\r\n    - Android 10.0 (Q)\r\n    - Android 7.1.1 (Nougat)\r\n    - Android 7.0 (Nougat)\r\n5. I have tried the **File &gt; Invalidate Caches / Restart...** option choosing the **Invalidate and Restart** button\r\n6. I have tried the **File &gt; Sync Project with Gradle Files** option.\r\n7. I have tried the **File &gt; Sync with File System** option  \r\n\r\n**Edit:**  \r\nI have been able to go into the xml of the **main_activity** layout file and add a fragment tag manually and found that it can work. The following is the manual tag I managed to add:  \r\n\r\n    &lt;fragment\r\n            android:id=&quot;@+id/fragment&quot;\r\n            android:name=&quot;android.example.testfragments.ListFragment&quot;\r\n            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            android:layout_height=&quot;match_parent&quot;\r\n            tools:layout=&quot;@layout/fragment_list&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nStill working on fixing the drag-drop &quot;**No fragments found**&quot; issue.\r\n\r\nWhere to go from here?\r\n=\r\nDoes anyone know where I can go from here other than virtualizing another OS like Windows to see if it works there?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58159973/android-studio-on-ubuntu-18-04-no-fragments-found-how-do-i-create-one-or-mo","title":"Android Studio on Ubuntu 18.04: No Fragments Found...

I&#39;m understanding this correctly, you have data coming in that is an array of numbers or arrays and you want to be able to individually toggle each array.\r\n\r\nTo do so, you&#39;ll need to maintain a _visibility_ state for each entry.\r\n\r\nThis can be done using a plain object that looks like this...\r\n\r\n``` js\r\n{\r\n  &quot;0&quot;: true,\r\n  &quot;1&quot;: false,\r\n  //

use this to control how your data is rendered by creating a computed property that formats the array values.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false
