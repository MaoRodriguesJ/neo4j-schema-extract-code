It is just a weak point.\r\n\r\nI know that the account owner of the customers Google Play account can remove my account from the project but there must be a way from my side as well to say -&gt; I don&#39;t want to be part of it anymore and unlink from this project?!\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449519/remove-my-dev-account-from-google-play-console-projects","title":"Remove my Dev-Account from Google Play Console Projects"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net-core"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":10636628,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-jeJsiSaTwyU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAARbw/0swnYKNoAtA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mustafa Kunwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10636628/mustafa-kunwa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571399258,"creation_date":1571399258,"answer_id":58450250,"question_id":58449514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58450250","body_markdown":"try using\r\n\r\n    Request.Headers.GetValues(&quot;Bearer&quot;).First()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449514/how-to-access-the-headerauthorization-value-from-current-httpcontext-request-hea/58450250#58450250","title":"How to access the HeaderAuthorization value from current HttpContext.Request.headers"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":6936427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IT96d.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"An0d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6936427/an0d"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571399545,"creation_date":1571399545,"answer_id":58450332,"question_id":58449514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58450332","body_markdown":"    var token = await _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Authentication.GetAuthenticateInfoAsync(&quot;Bearer&quot;)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449514/how-to-access-the-headerauthorization-value-from-current-httpcontext-request-hea/58450332#58450332","title":"How to access the HeaderAuthorization value from current HttpContext.Request.headers"}],"owner":{"reputation":47,"user_id":10993965,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65add3d4503319703effa104f0e0cf1c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vijay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10993965/vijay"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33460,"user_id":2630078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/026ee7e928cc51cce92ab6e92c245ef6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kirk Larkin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2630078/kirk-larkin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571399545,"creation_date":1571396487,"last_edit_date":1571398786,"question_id":58449514,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449514","body_markdown":"I am trying to pass a Authorization header to my REST API, I am setting my JWT Bearer token in Angular service using HttpHeaders.

We don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with it but if you&#39;re using it as perhaps a dataSource for a table view or some other UI element, you may want to consider using a Results object instead of an Array.\r\n\r\nA significant advantage is, if you have 35,000 objects, that&#39;s a pretty sizable array and if you have more, it could overwhelm the device as ALL of that data is stored in memory. However, Results objects are lazily loaded so you could have a much larger dataset without overwhelming the device.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when Realm objects are stored in an array, they &#39;Disconnect&#39; from Realm and loose Realm functionality - they will not auto-update nor will changes to the actual object in Realm be reflected in that array nor can you just update the object - it doesn&#39;t appear to have a primary key.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you populate a Results object with those models, they will be live updating - so if for example the atm_id changes in Realm, that object will automatically be updated. If you need to change a property you can change it directly on that object within a write transaction.\r\n\r\nSo the pattern would be to have a class var of Results&lt;AdhocModel&gt; and load your objects into those results within viewDidLoad. As you add more models, the results object will automatically be updated.\r\n\r\nTo keep your UI fresh, you would want to add observers (aka [Notifications][2])to those Results so you can be notified when an object is updated so you can reload your tableView for example. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#using-a-realm-across-threads\r\n  [2]: https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#notifications","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449509/is-there-any-pagination-like-code-for-saving-json-data-to-realmdatabase/58464079#58464079","title":"Is there any pagination like code for saving JSON data to Realmdatabase"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11856603,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VX3VQvi5VaY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdryavAkeGFgP1qLUIguNCnlrnHbw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yashraj Gujar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11856603/yashraj-gujar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":511,"user_id":5588508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbQ7a.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Soroush","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5588508/soroush"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571492282,"creation_date":1571396482,"last_edit_date":1571397578,"question_id":58449509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449509","body_markdown":"I have a button and below it is the table view.

Jak pisze AP, cytując przedstawiciela\r\n        amerykańskich władz, oznacza to de facto, że Ankara otrzymała pozwolenie USA na okupowanie bezpiecznej strefy.\r\n        Negocjatorzy obu stron wydali komunikat, w kt&#243;rym napisano, że stworzenie bezpiecznej strefy &quot;będzie egzekwowane\r\n        przede wszystkim przez siły zbrojne Turcji&quot;.\r\n        Wiceprezydent podkreślił też, że prezydent Donald Trump zagroził, że jeśli Ankara nie zawiesi operacji\r\n        wojskowych, to on nie wycofa obecnych sankcji nałożonych na Turcję i pozwoli na wdrożenie następnych.\r\n        Dodał, że Ankara i Waszyngton &quot;zobowiązały się do wypracowania pokojowego rozwiązania i przyszłości dla\r\n        bezpiecznej strefy&quot; na p&#243;łnocnym wschodzie Syrii. Oznajmił, że amerykańskie siły w Syrii zaczęły już ułatwiać\r\n        Kurdom bezpieczne wycofanie się z przygranicznych teren&#243;w.\r\n        Pence powiedział r&#243;wnież dziennikarzom, że Ankara obiecała, że jej wojska nie zajmą miasta Kobane (Ajn al-Arab),\r\n        nazywanego ogniskiem zapalnym tego konfliktu. Minister spraw zagranicznych Turcji Mevlut Cavusoglu oznajmił\r\n        jednak, że Ankara nie udzieliła gwarancji dotyczących Kobane, a jej armia jedynie &quot;przerwała operacje&quot;. Dodał,\r\n        że status miasta Manbidż &quot;i innych region&#243;w&quot; na p&#243;łnocnym wschodzie Syrii, zostanie przedyskutowany z Rosją.\r\n        Kurdyjski polityk Aldar Chalil, komentując warunki rozejmu, powiedział telewizji Al-Arabija, że Erdogan chce\r\n        wedrzeć się na terytorium Syrii na głębokość 32 km, a Kurdowie już wcześniej odrzucili takie rozwiązanie. Dodał,\r\n        że aprobują zawieszenie broni, ale będą się bronić, jeśli zostaną zaatakowani.\r\n        Amerykańscy senatorowie, w tym wpływy sojusznik prezydenta Lindsey Graham, poinformowali, że niezależnie od\r\n        zapowiedzi rozejmu, będą &quot;pełną parą&quot; pracowali nad ustawą w sprawie nowych sankcji na Ankarę.\r\n        &quot;Wspaniałe wiadomości z Turcji&quot;\r\n        Trump podziękował na Twitterze Erodganowi i napisał, że otrzymał &quot;wspaniałe wiadomości z Turcji&quot;. &quot;Miliony\r\n        istnień ludzkich będą uratowane!&quot; - dodał. Oznajmił, że w tej sytuacji możliwa jest wizyta Erdogana w USA w\r\n        przyszłym miesiącu.\r\n        Nazwał też prezydenta Turcji &quot;twardym facetem&quot;, kt&#243;ry &quot;zrobił to, co trzeba&quot;. Dodał: &quot;Teraz Kurdowie będą\r\n        bardziej skłonni robić to, co trzeba&quot;.\r\n        Przedstawiciel strony tureckiej po negocjacjach powiedział agencji Reutera, że Turcja &quot;dostała dokładnie to,\r\n        czego chciała&quot;. Porozumienie pozwala Turcji uwolnić się od nałożonych już sankcji i uniknąć kolejnych, a to\r\n        oznacza, że w żaden spos&#243;b nie zostanie ukarana za inwazję w p&#243;łnocno-wschodniej Syrii - komentuje AP.\r\n        Reuters przypomina, że ekspedycja sił tureckich zmusiła do ucieczki 200 tys. cywil&#243;w. Wzbudziła też niepok&#243;j\r\n        wsp&#243;lnoty międzynarodowej o odrodzenie się Państwa Islamskiego (IS), kt&#243;rego bojownicy są zamknięci w\r\n        kurdyjskich więzieniach.\r\n        Turecka ofensywa wywołała też polityczną burzę w Waszyngtonie, gdzie politycy r&#243;żnych afiliacji krytykowali\r\n        prezydenta za decyzję o wycofaniu amerykańskich żołnierzy z Syrii, co Ankara uznała za przyzwolenie na podjęcie\r\n        operacji wojennych - komentuje Reuters.\r\n        W środę Trump bronił swojej decyzji, nazywając ją &quot;strategicznie błyskotliwą&quot;, ale Izba Reprezentant&#243;w tego\r\n        samego dnia przyjęła rezolucję potępiającą decyzję prezydenta o wycofaniu amerykańskich żołnierzy z Syrii.\r\n        Za rezolucją, w liczącej 435 miejsc niższej izbie Kongresu, głosowało 354 kongresmen&#243;w, czyli wszyscy Demokraci\r\n        i duża grupa Republikan&#243;w. W czwartek głosowanie nad analogiczną rezolucją zapowiedział Senat.\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;footer&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; bottom: 0;&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &amp;copy; {{ date(&#39;Y&#39;) }} {{ config(&#39;app.url&#39;) }} - All rights reserved.\r\n                    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;\r\n                        Company Slogan\r\n                    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;/table&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/footer&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```    \r\nI need Header and Footer to be visible on every page in PDF.\r\n\r\nThe template looks ok, but there is a problem with the header and footer.\r\n\r\nHeader = John Doe, Company Name, etc.\r\nFooter = Company slogan, @2019-10-17\r\n\r\nHow can I add in footer: [page number] from [number of pages]?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449505/how-to-add-a-header-and-footer-to-a-pdf-generated-with-dompdf-and-laravel-5-8","title":"How to add a header and footer to a PDF generated with DOMPDF and Laravel 5.8"},{"tags":["magento2","payment-gateway","payment","ccavenue"],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":2729560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/733569685/picture?type=large","display_name":"Deepika Soni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2729560/deepika-soni"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571396452,"creation_date":1571396452,"question_id":58449504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449504","body_markdown":"I integrated ccavenue payment gateway in Magento 2.3 and it&#39;s working fine but client asked to load payment gateway on website itself in iframe without redirecting it to the payment gateway&#39;s website\r\n\r\nI tried to look up the extension code provided by the ccavenue team but unable to figure it out by myself.

This lead to an issue with my data services because of two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. All methods that retrieve collection return `Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;` by convention\r\n2. EF does not provide `ToEnumerableAsync`.\r\n\r\nNow when I remove `await` the compiler no longer unfolds `Task` objects and I am left with compilation error which says that `Task&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;` cannot be converted to `Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;`.\r\n\r\nSo I set out to create my own `ToEnumerableAsnyc`. The &quot;PoC&quot; version looked like this:\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; ToEnumerableAsync&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; source)\r\n    =&gt; (await source.ToListAsync()).AsEnumerable();\r\n```\r\nHowever this only wraps the extra `await` and does not remove it, i.e. there is still my `await` and the one used internally from `ToListAsync`. To my understanding from the above linked article this generates unnecessary overhead. It&#39;s not signifficant, but is an overhead none the less. Please correct me if I am wrong :)\r\n\r\nSo I set out to find how Microsoft devs went about to implement `ToListAsync` in **ASP.NET Core 2.2** and I managed to create my own implementation of `ToEnumerableAsync`, which does not use `await` based on their solution. That&#39;s how it looks:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; ToEnumerableAsync&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; queryable)\r\n{\r\n    var asyncEnum = AsAsyncEnumerable(queryable);\r\n    var list = new List&lt;T&gt;();\r\n\r\n    return asyncEnum.Aggregate(\r\n        (IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)list,\r\n        (list, x) =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            ((List&lt;T&gt;)list).Add(x);\r\n            return list;\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; AsAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; queryable)\r\n{\r\n    if (queryable is IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; asyncEnumerable)\r\n    {\r\n        return asyncEnumerable;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\r\n        $&quot;Cannot cast \\&quot;IQueryable\\&quot; to \\&quot;IAsyncEnumerable\\&quot;. Type: \\&quot;{typeof(T).FullName}\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally to my question: What can go wrong with the cast of `IQueryable&lt;T&gt;` to `IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` that the devs put explicit `InvalidOperationExeption`? How and why can an `IQueryable&lt;T&gt;` fail to cast to `IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;`?\r\n\r\nOriginal EF file: [QueriableExtensions.cs](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/release/2.2/src/EFCore/Extensions/Internal/QueryableExtensions.cs).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449494/potential-problems-with-casting-iqueryablet-to-iasyncenumerablet","title":"Potential problems with casting IQueryable&lt;T&gt;

To filter at the `NETWORK` layer based on process ID it is necessary to open two WinDivert handles:\r\n\r\n1. One handle at the `SOCKET` layer to build a mapping from network 5-tuples to the `ProcessID`s.\r\n2. Another handle at the `NETWORK` layer to do the actual filtering.  To do so, the network 5-tuple of the packet is mapped to `ProcessID` using the `SOCKET`-layer mapping, and the packet can be filtered accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo, yes you do need to handles.\r\n\r\nThe other problem you mentioned is that, for a new connection, it is not guaranteed that the `SOCKET`-layer event will arrive first.  This is also true.  To work around this issue the user application should queue the `NETWORK`-layer event until the corresponding `SOCKET`-layer event arrives, and only process the packet once both events arrive.  This is a bit complicated, but it resolves the issue.

Dokey, So I figured I&#39;d jump into ASP.Net Core for a reporting Server. Now the goal of this was to cache, and aggregate reports that can then be distributed to Clients.\r\n\r\nSo before I setup everything to start making API calls to poll the data I figured I would build the scaffolding using CSV&#39;s, and because that&#39;s mostly the format the data is already in.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the MVC model I built a simple model\r\n```\r\npublic class MyModel {\r\n    public string ComputerName { get;

Then I added my janky line by line reading of the CSV and the HUGE ram usage vanished, but The moment I started inserting the data into the database it came back.\r\n\r\nThe CSV i&#39;m reading is about 26k lines and 5MB in size. The reason It&#39;s reporcessing the CSV every 5 seconds was to confirm the leak.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know what to do, somehow deleting and re-adding 5MB worth of data into a SQLite causes ram usage to spike up to 1GB.

Also tested everything with curl and they all work\r\n\r\nthe results are:  \r\n    id: 1571395252  \r\n    aStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n    bStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n    cStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n\r\nThe apache access log also look the same after first script times out the other 3 scripts get triggered. This is most certainly a apache/php conf issue or maybe even some win10 limitation... no clue.\r\n\r\nAnyone else ran into this issue? I also had the same issue a couple of months back but i ignored it cause i rarely develop on win but my curiosity won this time

From my debug log I can see this code is running several times almost simultaneously. \r\nThe strange thing is I have other in-app product that&#39;s always sending me message &quot;purchase failed&quot; and I also receive it on my test device several times in a row. Which shows as well that it runs failed events also several times instead of just once as it should. \r\nSo how to fix it? \r\n\r\n**update:**\r\nI created a brand new Google account and created a new product ID for my 1000 coins in the game. So when I tested on my device when I pressed the button I bought 1000 coins, when I pressed second time I went through the buying process but received not 1000 but 2000 coins. When I pressed button 3rd time I received 3000 coins. It seems that the problem is not in the code but somewhere between my device and Google Play. Is there anything I can check? Like I&#39;ve already checked my payment method and Public Key. What else?

If possible do it over one big string instead of looping it through since loop is more expensive.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    In [29]: %%time\r\n        ...: replaced = tobe_replaced.sub(&quot;replaced&quot;, &quot;\\n&quot;.join(x)).split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n    Wall time: 291 ms\r\n\r\n    In [30]: %%time\r\n        ...: replaced = &quot;\\n&quot;.join(x).replace(&quot;str&quot;, &quot;replaced&quot;).split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n    Wall time: 132 ms\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449405/efficiently-replace-strings-in-20k-potential-matches-python/58450459#58450459","title":"Efficiently replace strings in 20k potential matches (Python)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12237944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d1df885852fca9ea46b99b9e08197e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ProblemsSolved","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12237944/problemssolved"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571399918,"creation_date":1571396102,"question_id":58449405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449405","body_markdown":"I want to replace substrings of a string and want to check against 20k+ candidates.\r\n\r\nIs there a more efficient way than to split the 20k into subgroups of 900 candidates and Loop over them? \r\n\r\n**This is my function:**\r\n\r\n    def replaceNames(mailString, nameList, replacement=&quot; Nachname&quot;):\r\n        anzNames = len(nameList)\r\n        seq = np.arange(start=0, stop=anzNames, step=900).tolist()\r\n        seq.append(anzNames)\r\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - 1):\r\n            tempNamesString = &quot;|&quot;.join(nameList[seq[i]:seq[i + 1]])\r\n            mailString = re.sub(tempNamesString, replacement, mailString)\r\n        return (mailString)\r\n\r\nthanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449405/efficiently-replace-strings-in-20k-potential-matches-python","title":"Efficiently replace strings in 20k potential matches (Python)"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12907,"user_id":1663383,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf8438a71124d393af5af486a7e78b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Draco18s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663383/draco18s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571407946,"post_id":58452413,"comment_id":103242908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449404/automatically-combine-different-meshes-into-one-while-keeping-textures/58452413#comment103242908_58452413"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":187,"user_id":3526396,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/afcc5bd5858585770c5d21373e6af45c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BooNonMooN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3526396/boononmoon"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571407170,"creation_date":1571407170,"answer_id":58452413,"question_id":58449404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452413","body_markdown":"You can use SubMeshes.

trying to use typescript to essentially write json data with a schema, so I need the Typescript compiler to compile enums into numbers in the js outputs but I can&#39;t get this to work.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a good few things already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/11202&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post is similar to the issue I&#39;m having but I&#39;m not using awesome-typescript-loader, I&#39;ve also tried everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39700306/const-enum-in-typescript-tsc-js-vs-typescript-js&quot; &gt;this&lt;/a&gt; stack overflow post but no joy. My ts-config is below\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;,\r\n        &quot;noImplicitAny&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;removeComments&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;preserveConstEnums&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;sourceMap&quot;: false\r\n    },\r\n        &quot;include&quot;: [\r\n          &quot;src/**/*&quot;\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m simply calling &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; on the command line in the root directory, it compiles everything but enums are compiled as &lt;code&gt;MyEnum_1.MyEnum.FirstValue&lt;/code&gt;.\r\nOther things I&#39;ve tried;\r\n\r\n - Changing the module to various different options\r\n - Changing the target to various different options\r\n - Adding different options and playing around with different lib values.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m running tsc -v 3.6.4 and have run out of ideas, has anyone had a similar issue?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Below is an example of the type of enum I&#39;m importing\r\n\r\n    export enum MyEnum {\r\n        Undefined,\r\n        FirstValue,\r\n        SecondValue,\r\n        ThirdValue\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEDIT: My an example of a typescript file would be... \r\n\r\n    import { MyEnum } from &quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;;\r\n    import { ItemType } from &quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;;\r\n\r\n    var item: ItemType = { \r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: MyEnum.FirstValue\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would expect this to compile to... \r\n\r\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n    exports.__esModule = true;\r\n    var MyEnum_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;);\r\n    var ItemType_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;);\r\n    var item = {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: 1\r\n    };\r\n\r\nInstead it compiles to;\r\n\r\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n    exports.__esModule = true;\r\n    var MyEnum_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;);\r\n    var ItemType_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;);\r\n    var item = {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: MyEnum_1.MyEnum.FirstValue\r\n    };\r\n\r\nI pretty much don&#39;t care how it compiles as long as the enum compiles to a number.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449389/typescript-not-compiling-enums-to-numbers","title":"Typescript not compiling enums to

What&#39;s wrong with Angular? or Node? I can&#39;t figure out why I can no longer create simple js and css files and call them inside the &quot;index.html&quot; file! When I call them from &quot;index.html&quot; file, the autocompletion works fine and points to their correct paths.. But when I hover on their path holding &quot;ctrl&quot; button to open them, Visual Studio Code can&#39;t find them!! Wait, whaaaat? You just suggested me the correct path! \r\nWhen I try to build the project, I find the output dist in a hell of disorder: some images are in the root folder, and some others are in &quot;/assets/img&quot; folder.. When I deploy the output folder to the server, it can&#39;t even point to the basic js and css files!\r\n\r\nI even tried to create a new blank project, and a file called &quot;app.js&quot; in the same level as &quot;index.html&quot;, I just have put a &quot;console.log&quot; instruction inside the &quot;app.js&quot; and then call it in the &quot;index.html&quot; with:\r\n\r\n```&lt;script src=&quot;app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```&lt;script src=&quot;./app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;```\r\n\r\nbut none of them seems to work! it searches for the file in a one level up from the src folder, not INSIDE the src folder! It usually works fine, I don&#39;t know what happened with Angular..\r\n\r\nBy the way, I tried this on 2 different PCs, with 2 different Angular versions (8 and 7), and 2 different code editors, I even uninstalled and re-installed the latest version of Node.js and cleaned the cache, and whatever new project I create on both PCs, I face the same problem!\r\n\r\nHere is a sample project path on github:\r\n[Angular issue][1]\r\n\r\nAny Ideas about what it could be?

may don&#39;t understand your problem well. But as I can see in the picture you have more than one record per day and that is your main problem. solving this is not very hard. note that you can pass **tensors** as your `X` and bind all you multiple records into a matrix. \r\n\r\nFor example, the simple tensor of your data will be this:\r\n\r\n    date :                        [Entity vector, Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:          [[A, B, C, D], [18.1, 22, 36, 46], …, [25, 24, 23, 50]]\r\n    25/05/2019:                         [[A, B, C], [43, 44, 35], …, [24, 0, 0]]\r\n    27/05/2019: [[A, B, C, D, F], [34, 46, 31, 27, 60], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35]]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** it may be necessary to have all of your vectors in the same length (for matrix mult). Then you can use &quot;[Padding][1]&quot;. (it means just put `0` or `-1` for missing entities. There is two possible senarios for you:\r\n \r\n1) if you have ***finite entities***, like having just `A` to `F`. You just add `-1` for not peresent values. And no need for the first vector, becuse they are fixed and for exapmple `index 1` always represents `A`. The final tensors will be like this after padding:\r\n\r\n    date : &quot;indexes are [A, B, C, D, E, F]&quot; [Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:   [[18.1, 22, 36, 46, -1, -1], …, [25, 24, 23, 50, -1, -1]]\r\n    25/05/2019:       [[43, 44, 35, -1, -1, -1], …, [24, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1]]\r\n    27/05/2019:     [[34, 46, 31, 27, 60, -1], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35, -1]]\r\n\r\n2) if you have ***infinite entities***, I mean if your entities could be anything. then you have to keep the first vector and just pad all vectors to the maximum length vector. The final tensors will be like this in this case after padding (supposing `27/05/2019` has the max length):\r\n\r\n    date :                            [Entity vector, Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:  [[A, B, C, D, -1], [18.1, 22, 36, 46, -1], …, [25, 24, 23, 50, -1]]\r\n    25/05/2019:     [[A, B, C, -1, -1], [43, 44, 35, -1, -1], …, [24, 0, 0, -1, -1]]\r\n    27/05/2019:     [[A, B, C, D, F], [34, 46, 31, 27, 60], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35]]\r\n\r\n&gt; TIP: if your entities are more than one word, then you can use [a hash][2] to transfer them to just one number. (I don&#39;t recommend using a series of word-embeddings for this! this is too heavy for this 6-moths-data LSTM model, and you won&#39;t get a good result out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, you feed these vectors into your LSTM. In the picture below, `X0` and `X1` and … are these tensors. (and you many expect the next day price from `h`s).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44131718/padding-time-series-subsequences-for-lstm-rnn-training\r\n  [2]: https://medium.com/value-stream-design/introducing-one-of-the-best-hacks-in-machine-learning-the-hashing-trick-bf6a9c8af18f\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMEa7.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449353/lstm-deal-with-multiple-rows-in-a-date/58467227#58467227","title":"LSTM - Deal with multiple rows in a date"}],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":1584253,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788a85c7d7c1f703d312f06e7b6570fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1584253","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1584253/user1584253"},"last_editor":{"reputation":396,"user_id":1584253,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788a85c7d7c1f703d312f06e7b6570fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1584253","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1584253/user1584253"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571722677,"creation_date":1571395892,"last_edit_date":1571722677,"question_id":58449353,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449353","body_markdown":"I have a time series data of around 6 months having columns &#39;entity&#39; (Free text) and &#39;cost&#39;.

Redux with [hooks][1]. \r\n    \r\n  They are part of React-redux library (`connect` function is also part of it). In this case, hooks like `useDispatch` is just the same as using `connect` with second argument set to `null`. `dispatch` function will be made available to the component and you can dispatch plain object actions (like `{ type: ACTION1, payload: &#39;payload&#39; }` or async actions (functions) if you&#39;ve used thunk middleware when creating store.\r\n\r\n  So in this case hooks are just another way to access the same Redux store\r\n\r\n2. React hook [`useReducer`][2]. This is not relate to Redux at all. To use `useReducer` you are not have to add Redux to project. `useReducer` is provided by React itself and has lot of limitations compared to Redux. Here are some:\r\n\r\n    a. There is no way to use middleware. All async actions should be processed using `useEffect` or similar technologies.\r\n\r\n    b. It cannot be used with any of React-redux functions. So you have to establish context or pass `dispatch` function using `props` to children\r\n\r\n  `useReducer` can be considered as very simplified version of Redux\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://react-redux.js.org/next/api/hooks\r\n  [2]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449561/where-should-we-do-async-api-call-in-redux-when-you-are-using-react-hooks/58449877#58449877","title":"Where should we do async Api call in Redux ,when you are using React-hooks?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":28,"user_id":2848658,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000534045127/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ved Prakash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2848658/ved-prakash"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571398211,"creation_date":1571398211,"answer_id":58449990,"question_id":58449561,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58449990","body_markdown":"You can use useEffect hook.

Following that design pattern will correct the UI lockup.\r\n\r\nThis is another issue\r\n\r\n    func saveToDb(data: AdhocModel) {\r\n            **let adhoc = AdhocDB()**\r\n\r\nYou want to write your populated model to realm, but AdhocDB is a Results object, not a Realm model object. Additionally the realm object created in `appTutorialData` which is *model*, is passed to saveToDb, then *another* object is created and then populated with data from the first object. There&#39;s no reason to do that (in this code)\r\n\r\nAssuming AdHocModel is a Realm object, this is much cleaner\r\n\r\n    func appTutorialData(json: NSDictionary) {\r\n        adhocJSONDatafromAPI = json\r\n        let apiData = adhocJSONDatafromAPI.value(forKey: &quot;data&quot;) as! [NSDictionary]\r\n        print(&quot;Start Index of the data : &quot;,apiData.startIndex)\r\n        print(&quot;End Index of the data : &quot;,apiData.endIndex)\r\n        apiData.forEach { (abc) in\r\n            let model = AdhocModel()\r\n            model.site_id = abc.value(forKey: &quot;site_id&quot;) as! Int\r\n            model.atm_id = abc.value(forKey: &quot;atm_id&quot;) as! String\r\n            model.site_address = abc.value(forKey: &quot;site_address&quot;) as! String\r\n            try! realm.write {\r\n                realm.add(model)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou&#39;re going to want to wrap that write within a background thread (again, see the documentation) something like this\r\n\r\n    DispatchQueue(label: &quot;background&quot;).async {\r\n        autoreleasepool {\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            .\r\n            try! realm.write {\r\n                realm.add(model)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may ask about populating your array `adhocData.append(model)`. We don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing with it but if you&#39;re using it as perhaps a dataSource for a table view or some other UI element, you may want to consider using a Results object instead of an Array.\r\n\r\nA significant advantage is, if you have 35,000 objects, that&#39;s a pretty sizable array and if you have more, it could overwhelm the device as ALL of that data is stored in memory. However, Results objects are lazily loaded so you could have a much larger dataset without overwhelming the device.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, when Realm objects are stored in an array, they &#39;Disconnect&#39; from Realm and loose Realm functionality - they will not auto-update nor will changes to the actual object in Realm be reflected in that array nor can you just update the object - it doesn&#39;t appear to have a primary key.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you populate a Results object with those models, they will be live updating - so if for example the atm_id changes in Realm, that object will automatically be updated. If you need to change a property you can change it directly on that object within a write transaction.\r\n\r\nSo the pattern would be to have a class var of Results&lt;AdhocModel&gt; and load your objects into those results within viewDidLoad. As you add more models, the results object will automatically be updated.\r\n\r\nTo keep your UI fresh, you would want to add observers (aka [Notifications][2])to those Results so you can be notified when an object is updated so you can reload your tableView for example. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#using-a-realm-across-threads\r\n  [2]: https://realm.io/docs/swift/latest/#notifications","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449509/is-there-any-pagination-like-code-for-saving-json-data-to-realmdatabase/58464079#58464079","title":"Is there any pagination like code for saving JSON data to Realmdatabase"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11856603,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-VX3VQvi5VaY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdryavAkeGFgP1qLUIguNCnlrnHbw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yashraj Gujar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11856603/yashraj-gujar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":511,"user_id":5588508,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pbQ7a.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Soroush","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5588508/soroush"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571492282,"creation_date":1571396482,"last_edit_date":1571397578,"question_id":58449509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449509","body_markdown":"I have a button and below it is the table view.

Jak pisze AP, cytując przedstawiciela\r\n        amerykańskich władz, oznacza to de facto, że Ankara otrzymała pozwolenie USA na okupowanie bezpiecznej strefy.\r\n        Negocjatorzy obu stron wydali komunikat, w kt&#243;rym napisano, że stworzenie bezpiecznej strefy &quot;będzie egzekwowane\r\n        przede wszystkim przez siły zbrojne Turcji&quot;.\r\n        Wiceprezydent podkreślił też, że prezydent Donald Trump zagroził, że jeśli Ankara nie zawiesi operacji\r\n        wojskowych, to on nie wycofa obecnych sankcji nałożonych na Turcję i pozwoli na wdrożenie następnych.\r\n        Dodał, że Ankara i Waszyngton &quot;zobowiązały się do wypracowania pokojowego rozwiązania i przyszłości dla\r\n        bezpiecznej strefy&quot; na p&#243;łnocnym wschodzie Syrii. Oznajmił, że amerykańskie siły w Syrii zaczęły już ułatwiać\r\n        Kurdom bezpieczne wycofanie się z przygranicznych teren&#243;w.\r\n        Pence powiedział r&#243;wnież dziennikarzom, że Ankara obiecała, że jej wojska nie zajmą miasta Kobane (Ajn al-Arab),\r\n        nazywanego ogniskiem zapalnym tego konfliktu. Minister spraw zagranicznych Turcji Mevlut Cavusoglu oznajmił\r\n        jednak, że Ankara nie udzieliła gwarancji dotyczących Kobane, a jej armia jedynie &quot;przerwała operacje&quot;. Dodał,\r\n        że status miasta Manbidż &quot;i innych region&#243;w&quot; na p&#243;łnocnym wschodzie Syrii, zostanie przedyskutowany z Rosją.\r\n        Kurdyjski polityk Aldar Chalil, komentując warunki rozejmu, powiedział telewizji Al-Arabija, że Erdogan chce\r\n        wedrzeć się na terytorium Syrii na głębokość 32 km, a Kurdowie już wcześniej odrzucili takie rozwiązanie. Dodał,\r\n        że aprobują zawieszenie broni, ale będą się bronić, jeśli zostaną zaatakowani.\r\n        Amerykańscy senatorowie, w tym wpływy sojusznik prezydenta Lindsey Graham, poinformowali, że niezależnie od\r\n        zapowiedzi rozejmu, będą &quot;pełną parą&quot; pracowali nad ustawą w sprawie nowych sankcji na Ankarę.\r\n        &quot;Wspaniałe wiadomości z Turcji&quot;\r\n        Trump podziękował na Twitterze Erodganowi i napisał, że otrzymał &quot;wspaniałe wiadomości z Turcji&quot;. &quot;Miliony\r\n        istnień ludzkich będą uratowane!&quot; - dodał. Oznajmił, że w tej sytuacji możliwa jest wizyta Erdogana w USA w\r\n        przyszłym miesiącu.\r\n        Nazwał też prezydenta Turcji &quot;twardym facetem&quot;, kt&#243;ry &quot;zrobił to, co trzeba&quot;. Dodał: &quot;Teraz Kurdowie będą\r\n        bardziej skłonni robić to, co trzeba&quot;.\r\n        Przedstawiciel strony tureckiej po negocjacjach powiedział agencji Reutera, że Turcja &quot;dostała dokładnie to,\r\n        czego chciała&quot;. Porozumienie pozwala Turcji uwolnić się od nałożonych już sankcji i uniknąć kolejnych, a to\r\n        oznacza, że w żaden spos&#243;b nie zostanie ukarana za inwazję w p&#243;łnocno-wschodniej Syrii - komentuje AP.\r\n        Reuters przypomina, że ekspedycja sił tureckich zmusiła do ucieczki 200 tys. cywil&#243;w. Wzbudziła też niepok&#243;j\r\n        wsp&#243;lnoty międzynarodowej o odrodzenie się Państwa Islamskiego (IS), kt&#243;rego bojownicy są zamknięci w\r\n        kurdyjskich więzieniach.\r\n        Turecka ofensywa wywołała też polityczną burzę w Waszyngtonie, gdzie politycy r&#243;żnych afiliacji krytykowali\r\n        prezydenta za decyzję o wycofaniu amerykańskich żołnierzy z Syrii, co Ankara uznała za przyzwolenie na podjęcie\r\n        operacji wojennych - komentuje Reuters.\r\n        W środę Trump bronił swojej decyzji, nazywając ją &quot;strategicznie błyskotliwą&quot;, ale Izba Reprezentant&#243;w tego\r\n        samego dnia przyjęła rezolucję potępiającą decyzję prezydenta o wycofaniu amerykańskich żołnierzy z Syrii.\r\n        Za rezolucją, w liczącej 435 miejsc niższej izbie Kongresu, głosowało 354 kongresmen&#243;w, czyli wszyscy Demokraci\r\n        i duża grupa Republikan&#243;w. W czwartek głosowanie nad analogiczną rezolucją zapowiedział Senat.\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;footer&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;footer&quot; style=&quot;position: absolute; bottom: 0;&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;tr&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &amp;copy; {{ date(&#39;Y&#39;) }} {{ config(&#39;app.url&#39;) }} - All rights reserved.\r\n                    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                    &lt;td align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;&gt;\r\n                        Company Slogan\r\n                    &lt;/td&gt;\r\n                &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n            &lt;/table&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/footer&gt;\r\n&lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```    \r\nI need Header and Footer to be visible on every page in PDF.\r\n\r\nThe template looks ok, but there is a problem with the header and footer.\r\n\r\nHeader = John Doe, Company Name, etc.\r\nFooter = Company slogan, @2019-10-17\r\n\r\nHow can I add in footer: [page number] from [number of pages]?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449505/how-to-add-a-header-and-footer-to-a-pdf-generated-with-dompdf-and-laravel-5-8","title":"How to add a header and footer to a PDF generated with DOMPDF and Laravel 5.8"},{"tags":["magento2","payment-gateway","payment","ccavenue"],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":2729560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/733569685/picture?type=large","display_name":"Deepika Soni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2729560/deepika-soni"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571396452,"creation_date":1571396452,"question_id":58449504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449504","body_markdown":"I integrated ccavenue payment gateway in Magento 2.3 and it&#39;s working fine but client asked to load payment gateway on website itself in iframe without redirecting it to the payment gateway&#39;s website\r\n\r\nI tried to look up the extension code provided by the ccavenue team but unable to figure it out by myself.

This lead to an issue with my data services because of two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. All methods that retrieve collection return `Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;` by convention\r\n2. EF does not provide `ToEnumerableAsync`.\r\n\r\nNow when I remove `await` the compiler no longer unfolds `Task` objects and I am left with compilation error which says that `Task&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;` cannot be converted to `Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt;`.\r\n\r\nSo I set out to create my own `ToEnumerableAsnyc`. The &quot;PoC&quot; version looked like this:\r\n```c#\r\npublic static IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; ToEnumerableAsync&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; source)\r\n    =&gt; (await source.ToListAsync()).AsEnumerable();\r\n```\r\nHowever this only wraps the extra `await` and does not remove it, i.e. there is still my `await` and the one used internally from `ToListAsync`. To my understanding from the above linked article this generates unnecessary overhead. It&#39;s not signifficant, but is an overhead none the less. Please correct me if I am wrong :)\r\n\r\nSo I set out to find how Microsoft devs went about to implement `ToListAsync` in **ASP.NET Core 2.2** and I managed to create my own implementation of `ToEnumerableAsync`, which does not use `await` based on their solution. That&#39;s how it looks:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\npublic static Task&lt;IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;&gt; ToEnumerableAsync&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; queryable)\r\n{\r\n    var asyncEnum = AsAsyncEnumerable(queryable);\r\n    var list = new List&lt;T&gt;();\r\n\r\n    return asyncEnum.Aggregate(\r\n        (IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;)list,\r\n        (list, x) =&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            ((List&lt;T&gt;)list).Add(x);\r\n            return list;\r\n        });\r\n}\r\n\r\nprivate static IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; AsAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;(this IQueryable&lt;T&gt; queryable)\r\n{\r\n    if (queryable is IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt; asyncEnumerable)\r\n    {\r\n        return asyncEnumerable;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    throw new InvalidOperationException(\r\n        $&quot;Cannot cast \\&quot;IQueryable\\&quot; to \\&quot;IAsyncEnumerable\\&quot;. Type: \\&quot;{typeof(T).FullName}\\&quot;&quot;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally to my question: What can go wrong with the cast of `IQueryable&lt;T&gt;` to `IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` that the devs put explicit `InvalidOperationExeption`? How and why can an `IQueryable&lt;T&gt;` fail to cast to `IAsyncEnumerable&lt;T&gt;`?\r\n\r\nOriginal EF file: [QueriableExtensions.cs](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore/blob/release/2.2/src/EFCore/Extensions/Internal/QueryableExtensions.cs).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449494/potential-problems-with-casting-iqueryablet-to-iasyncenumerablet","title":"Potential problems with casting IQueryable&lt;T&gt;

To filter at the `NETWORK` layer based on process ID it is necessary to open two WinDivert handles:\r\n\r\n1. One handle at the `SOCKET` layer to build a mapping from network 5-tuples to the `ProcessID`s.\r\n2. Another handle at the `NETWORK` layer to do the actual filtering.  To do so, the network 5-tuple of the packet is mapped to `ProcessID` using the `SOCKET`-layer mapping, and the packet can be filtered accordingly.\r\n\r\nSo, yes you do need to handles.\r\n\r\nThe other problem you mentioned is that, for a new connection, it is not guaranteed that the `SOCKET`-layer event will arrive first.  This is also true.  To work around this issue the user application should queue the `NETWORK`-layer event until the corresponding `SOCKET`-layer event arrives, and only process the packet once both events arrive.  This is a bit complicated, but it resolves the issue.

Dokey, So I figured I&#39;d jump into ASP.Net Core for a reporting Server. Now the goal of this was to cache, and aggregate reports that can then be distributed to Clients.\r\n\r\nSo before I setup everything to start making API calls to poll the data I figured I would build the scaffolding using CSV&#39;s, and because that&#39;s mostly the format the data is already in.\r\n\r\nIn the nature of the MVC model I built a simple model\r\n```\r\npublic class MyModel {\r\n    public string ComputerName { get;

Then I added my janky line by line reading of the CSV and the HUGE ram usage vanished, but The moment I started inserting the data into the database it came back.\r\n\r\nThe CSV i&#39;m reading is about 26k lines and 5MB in size. The reason It&#39;s reporcessing the CSV every 5 seconds was to confirm the leak.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know what to do, somehow deleting and re-adding 5MB worth of data into a SQLite causes ram usage to spike up to 1GB.

Also tested everything with curl and they all work\r\n\r\nthe results are:  \r\n    id: 1571395252  \r\n    aStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n    bStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n    cStartTime: 1571395257 (+5sec)  \r\n\r\nThe apache access log also look the same after first script times out the other 3 scripts get triggered. This is most certainly a apache/php conf issue or maybe even some win10 limitation... no clue.\r\n\r\nAnyone else ran into this issue? I also had the same issue a couple of months back but i ignored it cause i rarely develop on win but my curiosity won this time

From my debug log I can see this code is running several times almost simultaneously. \r\nThe strange thing is I have other in-app product that&#39;s always sending me message &quot;purchase failed&quot; and I also receive it on my test device several times in a row. Which shows as well that it runs failed events also several times instead of just once as it should. \r\nSo how to fix it? \r\n\r\n**update:**\r\nI created a brand new Google account and created a new product ID for my 1000 coins in the game. So when I tested on my device when I pressed the button I bought 1000 coins, when I pressed second time I went through the buying process but received not 1000 but 2000 coins. When I pressed button 3rd time I received 3000 coins. It seems that the problem is not in the code but somewhere between my device and Google Play. Is there anything I can check? Like I&#39;ve already checked my payment method and Public Key. What else?

If possible do it over one big string instead of looping it through since loop is more expensive.\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    In [29]: %%time\r\n        ...: replaced = tobe_replaced.sub(&quot;replaced&quot;, &quot;\\n&quot;.join(x)).split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n    Wall time: 291 ms\r\n\r\n    In [30]: %%time\r\n        ...: replaced = &quot;\\n&quot;.join(x).replace(&quot;str&quot;, &quot;replaced&quot;).split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n        ...:\r\n    Wall time: 132 ms\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nHope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449405/efficiently-replace-strings-in-20k-potential-matches-python/58450459#58450459","title":"Efficiently replace strings in 20k potential matches (Python)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12237944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d1df885852fca9ea46b99b9e08197e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ProblemsSolved","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12237944/problemssolved"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571399918,"creation_date":1571396102,"question_id":58449405,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449405","body_markdown":"I want to replace substrings of a string and want to check against 20k+ candidates.\r\n\r\nIs there a more efficient way than to split the 20k into subgroups of 900 candidates and Loop over them? \r\n\r\n**This is my function:**\r\n\r\n    def replaceNames(mailString, nameList, replacement=&quot; Nachname&quot;):\r\n        anzNames = len(nameList)\r\n        seq = np.arange(start=0, stop=anzNames, step=900).tolist()\r\n        seq.append(anzNames)\r\n        for i in range(0, len(seq) - 1):\r\n            tempNamesString = &quot;|&quot;.join(nameList[seq[i]:seq[i + 1]])\r\n            mailString = re.sub(tempNamesString, replacement, mailString)\r\n        return (mailString)\r\n\r\nthanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449405/efficiently-replace-strings-in-20k-potential-matches-python","title":"Efficiently replace strings in 20k potential matches (Python)"},{"tags":["c#","unity3d"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12907,"user_id":1663383,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf8438a71124d393af5af486a7e78b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Draco18s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663383/draco18s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571407946,"post_id":58452413,"comment_id":103242908,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449404/automatically-combine-different-meshes-into-one-while-keeping-textures/58452413#comment103242908_58452413"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":187,"user_id":3526396,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/afcc5bd5858585770c5d21373e6af45c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"BooNonMooN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3526396/boononmoon"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571407170,"creation_date":1571407170,"answer_id":58452413,"question_id":58449404,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58452413","body_markdown":"You can use SubMeshes.

trying to use typescript to essentially write json data with a schema, so I need the Typescript compiler to compile enums into numbers in the js outputs but I can&#39;t get this to work.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a good few things already, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/11202&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post is similar to the issue I&#39;m having but I&#39;m not using awesome-typescript-loader, I&#39;ve also tried everything &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39700306/const-enum-in-typescript-tsc-js-vs-typescript-js&quot; &gt;this&lt;/a&gt; stack overflow post but no joy. My ts-config is below\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;compilerOptions&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;module&quot;: &quot;commonjs&quot;,\r\n        &quot;noImplicitAny&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;removeComments&quot;: true,\r\n        &quot;preserveConstEnums&quot;: false,\r\n        &quot;sourceMap&quot;: false\r\n    },\r\n        &quot;include&quot;: [\r\n          &quot;src/**/*&quot;\r\n        ]\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m simply calling &lt;code&gt;tsc&lt;/code&gt; on the command line in the root directory, it compiles everything but enums are compiled as &lt;code&gt;MyEnum_1.MyEnum.FirstValue&lt;/code&gt;.\r\nOther things I&#39;ve tried;\r\n\r\n - Changing the module to various different options\r\n - Changing the target to various different options\r\n - Adding different options and playing around with different lib values.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m running tsc -v 3.6.4 and have run out of ideas, has anyone had a similar issue?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Below is an example of the type of enum I&#39;m importing\r\n\r\n    export enum MyEnum {\r\n        Undefined,\r\n        FirstValue,\r\n        SecondValue,\r\n        ThirdValue\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEDIT: My an example of a typescript file would be... \r\n\r\n    import { MyEnum } from &quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;;\r\n    import { ItemType } from &quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;;\r\n\r\n    var item: ItemType = { \r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: MyEnum.FirstValue\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI would expect this to compile to... \r\n\r\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n    exports.__esModule = true;\r\n    var MyEnum_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;);\r\n    var ItemType_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;);\r\n    var item = {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: 1\r\n    };\r\n\r\nInstead it compiles to;\r\n\r\n    &quot;use strict&quot;;\r\n    exports.__esModule = true;\r\n    var MyEnum_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/MyEnum&quot;);\r\n    var ItemType_1 = require(&quot;../../src/models/ItemType&quot;);\r\n    var item = {\r\n        &quot;id&quot;: &quot;00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000&quot;,\r\n        &quot;value&quot;: MyEnum_1.MyEnum.FirstValue\r\n    };\r\n\r\nI pretty much don&#39;t care how it compiles as long as the enum compiles to a number.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449389/typescript-not-compiling-enums-to-numbers","title":"Typescript not compiling enums to

What&#39;s wrong with Angular? or Node? I can&#39;t figure out why I can no longer create simple js and css files and call them inside the &quot;index.html&quot; file! When I call them from &quot;index.html&quot; file, the autocompletion works fine and points to their correct paths.. But when I hover on their path holding &quot;ctrl&quot; button to open them, Visual Studio Code can&#39;t find them!! Wait, whaaaat? You just suggested me the correct path! \r\nWhen I try to build the project, I find the output dist in a hell of disorder: some images are in the root folder, and some others are in &quot;/assets/img&quot; folder.. When I deploy the output folder to the server, it can&#39;t even point to the basic js and css files!\r\n\r\nI even tried to create a new blank project, and a file called &quot;app.js&quot; in the same level as &quot;index.html&quot;, I just have put a &quot;console.log&quot; instruction inside the &quot;app.js&quot; and then call it in the &quot;index.html&quot; with:\r\n\r\n```&lt;script src=&quot;app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```&lt;script src=&quot;./app.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;```\r\n\r\nbut none of them seems to work! it searches for the file in a one level up from the src folder, not INSIDE the src folder! It usually works fine, I don&#39;t know what happened with Angular..\r\n\r\nBy the way, I tried this on 2 different PCs, with 2 different Angular versions (8 and 7), and 2 different code editors, I even uninstalled and re-installed the latest version of Node.js and cleaned the cache, and whatever new project I create on both PCs, I face the same problem!\r\n\r\nHere is a sample project path on github:\r\n[Angular issue][1]\r\n\r\nAny Ideas about what it could be?

may don&#39;t understand your problem well. But as I can see in the picture you have more than one record per day and that is your main problem. solving this is not very hard. note that you can pass **tensors** as your `X` and bind all you multiple records into a matrix. \r\n\r\nFor example, the simple tensor of your data will be this:\r\n\r\n    date :                        [Entity vector, Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:          [[A, B, C, D], [18.1, 22, 36, 46], …, [25, 24, 23, 50]]\r\n    25/05/2019:                         [[A, B, C], [43, 44, 35], …, [24, 0, 0]]\r\n    27/05/2019: [[A, B, C, D, F], [34, 46, 31, 27, 60], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35]]\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** it may be necessary to have all of your vectors in the same length (for matrix mult). Then you can use &quot;[Padding][1]&quot;. (it means just put `0` or `-1` for missing entities. There is two possible senarios for you:\r\n \r\n1) if you have ***finite entities***, like having just `A` to `F`. You just add `-1` for not peresent values. And no need for the first vector, becuse they are fixed and for exapmple `index 1` always represents `A`. The final tensors will be like this after padding:\r\n\r\n    date : &quot;indexes are [A, B, C, D, E, F]&quot; [Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    -----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:   [[18.1, 22, 36, 46, -1, -1], …, [25, 24, 23, 50, -1, -1]]\r\n    25/05/2019:       [[43, 44, 35, -1, -1, -1], …, [24, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1]]\r\n    27/05/2019:     [[34, 46, 31, 27, 60, -1], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35, -1]]\r\n\r\n2) if you have ***infinite entities***, I mean if your entities could be anything. then you have to keep the first vector and just pad all vectors to the maximum length vector. The final tensors will be like this in this case after padding (supposing `27/05/2019` has the max length):\r\n\r\n    date :                            [Entity vector, Weight vector, …, Cost vector]\r\n    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    24/05/2019:  [[A, B, C, D, -1], [18.1, 22, 36, 46, -1], …, [25, 24, 23, 50, -1]]\r\n    25/05/2019:     [[A, B, C, -1, -1], [43, 44, 35, -1, -1], …, [24, 0, 0, -1, -1]]\r\n    27/05/2019:     [[A, B, C, D, F], [34, 46, 31, 27, 60], …, [27, 24, 23, 50, 35]]\r\n\r\n&gt; TIP: if your entities are more than one word, then you can use [a hash][2] to transfer them to just one number. (I don&#39;t recommend using a series of word-embeddings for this! this is too heavy for this 6-moths-data LSTM model, and you won&#39;t get a good result out of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, you feed these vectors into your LSTM. In the picture below, `X0` and `X1` and … are these tensors. (and you many expect the next day price from `h`s).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44131718/padding-time-series-subsequences-for-lstm-rnn-training\r\n  [2]: https://medium.com/value-stream-design/introducing-one-of-the-best-hacks-in-machine-learning-the-hashing-trick-bf6a9c8af18f\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vMEa7.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58449353/lstm-deal-with-multiple-rows-in-a-date/58467227#58467227","title":"LSTM - Deal with multiple rows in a date"}],"owner":{"reputation":396,"user_id":1584253,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788a85c7d7c1f703d312f06e7b6570fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1584253","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1584253/user1584253"},"last_editor":{"reputation":396,"user_id":1584253,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":35,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/788a85c7d7c1f703d312f06e7b6570fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1584253","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1584253/user1584253"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571722677,"creation_date":1571395892,"last_edit_date":1571722677,"question_id":58449353,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58449353","body_markdown":"I have a time series data of around 6 months having columns &#39;entity&#39; (Free text) and &#39;cost&#39;.
