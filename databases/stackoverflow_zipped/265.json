Therefor images not designed to handle such a random UID will fail with permission errors.\r\n\r\nIn order to get your image working I recommed you read following Article of the latest OpenShift documentation: https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/openshift_images/create-images.html\r\n\r\nHere the short version that relates to your issue:\r\n\r\n&gt; SUPPORT ARBITRARY USER IDS \r\n\r\n&gt; By default, OpenShift Container Platform\r\n&gt; runs containers using an arbitrarily assigned user ID. This provides\r\n&gt; additional security against processes escaping the container due to a\r\n&gt; container engine vulnerability and thereby achieving escalated\r\n&gt; permissions on the host node.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; For an image to support running as an arbitrary user, directories and\r\n&gt; files that may be written to by processes in the image should be owned\r\n&gt; by the root group and be read/writable by that group. Files to be\r\n&gt; executed should also have group execute permissions.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Adding the following to your Dockerfile sets the directory and file\r\n&gt; permissions to allow users in the root group to access them in the\r\n&gt; built image:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n    RUN chgrp -R 0 /some/directory &amp;&amp; \\\r\n        chmod -R g=u /some/directory \r\n\r\n&gt; Because the container user is always a member of the root group, the container user can read and write\r\n&gt; these files. The root group does not have any special permissions\r\n&gt; (unlike the root user) so there are no security concerns with this\r\n&gt; arrangement. In addition, the processes running in the container must\r\n&gt; not listen on privileged ports (ports below 1024), since they are not\r\n&gt; running as a privileged user.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473832/how-do-i-change-the-permissions-in-openshift-container-platform/58474145#58474145","title":"How do I change the permissions in openshift container platform?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2051,"user_id":8891738,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ghlwL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daein Park","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8891738/daein-park"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571582879,"creation_date":1571582879,"answer_id":58474152,"question_id":58473832,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58474152","body_markdown":"OpenShift runs the Pod with arbitrary UID by default.

have a problem with a project I&#39;m working on. I guess a full explanation is best...\r\nI have a very long array that works, for the following: Twelve checkboxes with all possible combinations of checked==true and checked==false with a minimum of three checked==true checkboxes. This is for choosing musical notes (C, C#, D D# etc.), one for each checkbox up to one octave, to represent all possible chords.\r\n\r\nI start with this:\r\n\r\n```        \r\n{\r\nvar cb = getElementsByType(form.getElementsByTagName(&#39;input&#39;), &quot;checkbox&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen one string looks like this:\r\n\r\n```  \r\n if ( \r\n   cb [0].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [1].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [2].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [3].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [4].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [5].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [6].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [7].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [8].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [9].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [10].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [11].checked == false ) \r\n{ \r\nalert(&#39;C&#39;); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nfor one chord (C major) and then the next chord:\r\n```\r\nelse if (    \r\n   cb [0].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [1].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [2].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [3].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [4].checked == false\r\n&amp;&amp; cb [5].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [6].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [7].checked == true \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [8].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [9].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [10].checked == false \r\n&amp;&amp; cb [11].checked == false ) \r\n) \r\n{ \r\nalert(&#39;Cm&#39;); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nNotice only checkboxes 3 and 4 are different.\r\nThen, way down at the end of all the possible chord combinations I have:\r\n\r\n```\r\nelse    \r\n{ \r\nalert(&#39;Sorry, your selection did not make a recognisable chord. Please try again. Remember to select at least three notes&#39;);    \r\n} \r\n}\r\n```\r\nLong as it is, it works, for one octave, which should be enough. However, for some less-experienced musicians, this is confusing, and two octaves would be better.\r\nSo, I have added twelve more checkboxes, and amended my code to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (\r\n   ( cb[0].checked == true || cb[12].checked == true ) \r\n&amp;&amp; ( cb[1].checked == false &amp;&amp; cb[13].checked == false ) \r\n&amp;&amp; ( cb[2].checked == false &amp;&amp; cb[14].checked == false )\r\n```\r\netc (I guess the parentheses are not needed for the &#39;false&#39;; it just helps to organise it that way) up to the end of the first chord:\r\n\r\n```\r\n) \r\n{ \r\nalert(&#39;C&#39;); \r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe problem I find is that after adding this to about half way through, it suddenly doesn&#39;t work. I guess this is a parsing limit that I have hit. \r\nSo what I need to do is find out how to shorten this, or else forget about adding a second octave.\r\nAny ideas greatly appreciated.\r\nHere is the page if anyone wants to look at the entire array: [Name That Chord][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://aboutchords.xyz/name-that-chord/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473829/have-i-hit-a-parsing-limit","title":"Have I hit a parsing limit?"},{"tags":["go","go-modules"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":179,"user_id":2922325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9899c6076db8f952438be96c18819024?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jazz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2922325/jazz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571591311,"creation_date":1571591311,"answer_id":58475332,"question_id":58473828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58475332","body_markdown":"A clean way to do achieve this is to have utils a standalone module outside of all projects and then import wherever you want.

As far as I understand this is not how its supposed to work since you can always cross refer nested package by module relative path.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe you know this, but since you are using modules, you need to sit in GOPATH/GOROOT for resolution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473828/how-to-nest-one-go-module-inside-multiple-go-modules-as-local-dependency/58475332#58475332","title":"How to nest one go module inside multiple Go modules as local dependency"}],"owner":{"reputation":4012,"user_id":6021597,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iyl6H.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ayush Gupta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6021597/ayush-gupta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571591311,"creation_date":1571580568,"question_id":58473828,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473828","body_markdown":"```\r\n$ go version\r\n1.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a folder structure as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGOPATH\r\n+---src\r\n     +--- my-api-server\r\n           +--- my-auth-server\r\n                 +--- main.go\r\n                 +--- go.mod\r\n                 +--- go.sum\r\n           +--- my-utils\r\n                 +--- go.mod\r\n                 +--- go.sum\r\n                 +--- uuid\r\n                       +--- uuid.go\r\n```\r\n\r\n`my-auth-server` uses `my-api-server/my-utils/uuid` as a dependency\r\n\r\nI tried moving `my-utils` inside `my-auth-server`, but as a library, `my-utils` will be used in multiple places.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, `my-utils` also has a `go.mod`, but that contains a `module` declaration.\r\nIf I place it in `my-auth-server`, the module path becomes `my-api-server/my-auth-server/my-utils`\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I have 2 servers,\r\n\r\n- `my-auth-server`\r\n- `my-session-server`\r\n\r\nI cannot place `my-utils` inside both because there can only be one `module` declaration per `go.mod`.\r\n\r\nSo, how I use this in two different projects as submodule?\r\n\r\nAny help in solving this would also be appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473828/how-to-nest-one-go-module-inside-multiple-go-modules-as-local-dependency","title":"How to nest one go module inside multiple Go modules as local dependency"},{"tags":["c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":49708,"user_id":892256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/15FJW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ed Heal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/892256/ed-heal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571580719,"post_id":58473826,"comment_id":103280808,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473826/split-a-string-to-return-the-word-and-integer-in-c#comment103280808_58473826"},{"owner":{"reputation":24347,"user_id":3923896,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4139ee1298ce4b0690a788cb97d47569?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Steve Summit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3923896/steve-summit"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571580777,"post_id":58473826,"comment_id":103280826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473826/split-a-string-to-return-the-word-and-integer-in-c#comment103280826_58473826"},{"owner":{"reputation":88159,"user_id":25324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c812d568dcbf02b96796728be3cac626?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pmg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/25324/pmg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571580795,"post_id":58473826,"comment_id":103280831,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473826/split-a-string-to-return-the-word-and-integer-in-c#comment103280831_58473826"},{"owner":{"reputation":49708,"user_id":892256,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/15FJW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ed Heal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/892256/ed-heal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571581312,"post_id":58473826,"comment_id":103280986,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473826/split-a-string-to-return-the-word-and-integer-in-c#comment103280986_58473826"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":7458049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1588840764489336/picture?type=large","display_name":"0x6261627564","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7458049/0x6261627564"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571580870,"creation_date":1571580870,"answer_id":58473875,"question_id":58473826,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58473875","body_markdown":"I think you are looking for the strcmp() function.

Therefore, I&#39;ve made a model class that takes its desired shape (ie. number of layers, their lengths and their activation functions) as arguments and automatically creates its structure including weights and biases based on these arguments.\r\n\r\n**The model class**\r\n```\r\nclass Model:\r\n  def __init__(self, shape, activations):\r\n    self.shape = shape\r\n    self.activations = [np.vectorize(a) for a in activations]\r\n    self.weights = [np.array([np.random.uniform(-1, 1, shape[i+1]) for n in range(shape[i])]) for i in range(len(shape)) if i &lt; len(shape)-1]\r\n    self.biases = [np.random.uniform(-1, 1, shape[i]) for i in range(len(shape))]  \r\n```  \r\nIn addition to that, I&#39;ve created a prediction method used for propagating input through that structure. And it works!\r\n\r\n**The prediction method** \r\n```\r\ndef predict(self, X):\r\n    predictions = []\r\n    for x in X:\r\n      for i in range(len(self.shape)):\r\n        x = np.add(x,self.biases[i])\r\n        x = self.activations[i](x)\r\n        if i &lt; len(self.shape)-1:\r\n          x = np.dot(x, self.weights[i])\r\n      predictions.append(x)\r\n    return predictions\r\n```\r\nHowever, the output is useless, since the model is not trained yet. As an optimization function, I&#39;ve come to a conclusion that gradient descent would be ideal. However, I tried looking up on how to implement it, and all I found was examples of implementations wherein the gradients were *manually* calculated for all of the features of the model&#39;s structure. Here comes my problem:\r\n\r\n**How do I train my model in a way that works for all possible structures?**\r\n\r\nThe method could look somewhat like this, and then it&#39;s just a question of how to get the gradients via the *self.get_grads* method:\r\n```\r\ndef fit(self, X, Y, epochs, lr, lossfunc):\r\n    for e in epochs:\r\n      Y_hat = self.predict(X)\r\n      loss = lossfunc(Y,Y_hat)\r\n      b_grads, w_grads = self.get_grads(loss)\r\n      for i in range(len(self.shape)):\r\n        self.biases[i] = np.add((-1.0) * lr * b_grads[i],self.biases[i])\r\n        if i &lt; len(self.shape)-1:\r\n          self.weights[i] = np.add((-1.0) * lr * w_grads[i], self.weights[i])\r\n```\r\n# Edit\r\n**Defining a model with the class is done like this**\r\n```\r\n# Defining some activation functions\r\nsigmoid = lambda x, prime=False: 1/(1+math.exp(-x)) if not prime else 1/(1+math.exp(-x))*(1-1/(1+math.exp(-x)))\r\nReLu = lambda x, prime=False: max(0, x) if not prime else max(max(0, x),1)\r\nim_width, im_height = 200,200\r\nnp.random.seed(1)\r\nmodel = Model(shape=[im_width*im_height,4],activations=[ReLu,sigmoid])\r\n```\r\n**Looking at structure of the model**\r\n```\r\nprint(f&quot;biases:{model.biases}&quot;)\r\nprint(f&quot;activations:{model.activations}&quot;)\r\nprint(f&quot;weights:{model.weights}&quot;)\r\n```\r\n**Output**\r\n```\r\nbiases:[array([

I am trying to test my method from another class that converts a binary number to decimal.\r\n\r\nHere is the full code:\r\n\r\n    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\r\n    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;\r\n\r\n\r\n    public class Einstiegsbeispieltest {\r\n\r\n    Einstiegsbeispiel testObject = new Einstiegsbeispiel();\r\n\r\n    @Test\r\n    public void testOne() {\r\n    assertEquals(14, testObject.binary2decimal(1110));\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve googled everywhere but no avail.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473796/cannot-import-assertions-from-junit","title":"Cannot import Assertions from JUnit"},{"tags":["java","selenium"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1946,"user_id":11019743,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8NmK.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christine","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11019743/christine"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571675783,"post_id":58473795,"comment_id":103311334,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473795/login-form-is-getting-expired-while-automating-login-feature#comment103311334_58473795"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":9986088,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5nwk5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kundan kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9986088/kundan-kumar"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571580321,"creation_date":1571580321,"question_id":58473795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473795","body_markdown":"Have you guys faced problem like login form is getting expired while automating the login script but  when i do login manually login works pretty good!\r\n\r\nI am fetching url and credentials from db!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473795/login-form-is-getting-expired-while-automating-login-feature","title":"Login form is getting expired while automating login feature"},{"tags":["php","mysql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":1279150,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R48Tv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HamletHub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279150/hamlethub"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3164,"user_id":3783243,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b89762bdc855905a2b6a15c49ddeae73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3783243","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3783243/user3783243"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571581269,"post_id":58473793,"comment_id":103280972,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473793/no-connection-2002-error-connecting-to-mysql-db-from-one-ip-but-works-from-a#comment103280972_58473793"},{"owner":{"reputation":3164,"user_id":3783243,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b89762bdc855905a2b6a15c49ddeae73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3783243","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3783243/user3783243"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571581685,"post_id":58473793,"comment_id":103281093,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473793/no-connection-2002-error-connecting-to-mysql-db-from-one-ip-but-works-from-a#comment103281093_58473793"},{"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":1279150,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R48Tv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HamletHub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279150/hamlethub"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3164,"user_id":3783243,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b89762bdc855905a2b6a15c49ddeae73?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3783243","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3783243/user3783243"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571582848,"post_id":58473793,"comment_id":103281431,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473793/no-connection-2002-error-connecting-to-mysql-db-from-one-ip-but-works-from-a#comment103281431_58473793"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":94,"user_id":1279150,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R48Tv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"HamletHub","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279150/hamlethub"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571583704,"creation_date":1571583704,"answer_id":58474257,"question_id":58473793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58474257","body_markdown":"There was an IP in the connection request.

the data in instead of just effectively &quot;nesting&quot; everything. Any data that a function requires should ideally be passed in to the function as a parameter:\n\n    def read_data():\n        read data from a file\n        create df\n        return df\n    \n    def parse_data(sorted_df):\n        count lines\n        sort by date\n        return sorted_df\n    \n    def add_new_column(new_column_df):\n        add new column\n        return new_column_df\n    \n    def create_plot(plot_data):  \n        create a plot\n        display chart\n    \n    df = read_data()\n    parsed = parse_data(df)\n    added = add_new_column(parsed)\n    create_plot(added)\n\nTry to make sure functions are only handling what they&#39;re directly responsible for. It isn&#39;t `parse_data`&#39;s job to know where the data is coming from or to produce the data, so it shouldn&#39;t be worrying about that. Let the caller handle that.\n\nThe way I have things set up here is often referred to as &quot;piping&quot; or &quot;threading&quot;. Information &quot;flows&quot; from one function into the next. In a language like Clojure, this could be written as:\n\n    (-&gt; (read-data)\n        (parse-data)\n        (add-new-column)\n        (create-plot))\n\nUsing the threading macro `-&gt;` which frees you up from manually needing to handle data passing. Unfortunately, Python doesn&#39;t have anything built in to do this, although it can be achieved using [external modules][1].\n\n-----\n\nAlso note that since dataframes seem to be mutable, you don&#39;t actually *need* to return the altered ones them from the functions. If you&#39;re just mutating the argument directly, you could just pass the same data frame to each of the functions in order instead of placing it in intermediate variables like `parsed` and `added`. The way I&#39;m showing here is a general way to set things up, but it can be altered depending on your exact use case. \n\n\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28252585/functional-pipes-in-python-like-from-rs-magritrr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473775/chaining-output-between-diffrent-functions/58473842#58473842","title":"Chaining output between diffrent functions"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":416992,"user_id":476,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a235706e3d81b614acaec3368edfea4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"deceze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/476/deceze"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571585146,"post_id":58473854,"comment_id":103282011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473775/chaining-output-between-diffrent-functions/58473854#comment103282011_58473854"},{"owner":{"reputation":2436,"user_id":5120049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9K6RV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishnudev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5120049/vishnudev"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":416992,"user_id":476,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a235706e3d81b614acaec3368edfea4b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"deceze","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/476/deceze"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571587850,"post_id":58473854,"comment_id":103282714,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473775/chaining-output-between-diffrent-functions/58473854#comment103282714_58473854"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2436,"user_id":5120049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9K6RV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishnudev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5120049/vishnudev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2436,"user_id":5120049,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9K6RV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishnudev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5120049/vishnudev"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571581120,"last_edit_date":1571581120,"creation_date":1571580773,"answer_id":58473854,"question_id":58473775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58473854","body_markdown":"Use class to contain your code\r\n    \r\n    class DataManipulation:\r\n        def __init__(self, path):\r\n            self.df = pd.DataFrame()\r\n            self.read_data(path)\r\n        \r\n        @staticmethod\r\n        def new(file_path):\r\n            return DataManipulation(path)\r\n    \r\n        def read_data(self, path):\r\n            read data from a file\r\n            self.df = create df\r\n    \r\n        def parse_data(self):\r\n            use self.df\r\n            count lines\r\n            sort by date\r\n            return self\r\n    \r\n        def add_new_column(self):\r\n            use self.df\r\n            add new column\r\n            return self\r\n    \r\n        def create_plot(self):\r\n            plot_data = add_new_column()\r\n            create a plot\r\n            display chart\r\n            return self\r\n\r\nAnd then,\r\n\r\n     d = DataManipulation.new(filepath).parse_data().add_column().create_plot()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473775/chaining-output-between-diffrent-functions/58473854#58473854","title":"Chaining output between diffrent functions"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10847862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/550a5e8234ed705157c712ded9fed4ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tore Djerberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10847862/tore-djerberg"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10847862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/550a5e8234ed705157c712ded9fed4ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tore Djerberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10847862/tore-djerberg"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58473842,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571589697,"creation_date":1571580172,"last_edit_date":1571589697,"question_id":58473775,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473775","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for the name for a procedure which handles output from one function in several others (trying to find better words for my problem).

Does Spring cloud stream help? \r\nIs this something similar to connecting multiple databases to a micro service ?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473765/spring-kafka-admin-client-multiple-bootstrap-servers-confluent-kafka-with-securi","title":"Spring Kafka Admin Client multiple bootstrap servers Confluent Kafka with security (jass_config)"},{"tags":["node.js","express","ejs","gulp-livereload"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7165450,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CxETV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7165450/alex"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571580083,"creation_date":1571580083,"question_id":58473764,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473764","body_markdown":"        const gulp = require(&#39;gulp&#39;);\r\n    const gulpIf = require(&#39;gulp-if&#39;);\r\n    const order = require(&#39;gulp-order&#39;);\r\n    const sass = require(&#39;gulp-sass&#39;);\r\n    const minifyCSS = require(&#39;gulp-clean-css&#39;);\r\n    const concat = require(&#39;gulp-concat&#39;);\r\n    const sourcemaps = require(&#39;gulp-sourcemaps&#39;);\r\n    const autoprefixer = require(&#39;gulp-autoprefixer&#39;);\r\n    const plumber = require(&#39;gulp-plumber&#39;);\r\n    const notify = require(&#39;gulp-notify&#39;);\r\n    const livereload = require(&#39;gulp-livereload&#39;);\r\n\r\n    const isDev = !process.env.NODE_ENV || process.env.NODE_ENV === &#39;development&#39;;\r\n    const autoprefixerBrowsers = [&#39;last 15 version&#39;];\r\n\r\n    function fnStyles(sourcePaths, orderList, destPath, concatName) {\r\n        return gulp\r\n            .src(sourcePaths)\r\n            // more manipulation\r\n            .pipe(gulp.dest(destPath))\r\n            .pipe(livereload());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;global:styles&#39;, function() {\r\n        return fnStyles(\r\n            [\r\n                &#39;sources/vendor/**/*.scss&#39;\r\n            ],\r\n            [\r\n                &#39;styles/reset.scss&#39;,\r\n                &#39;styles/fonts.scss&#39;,\r\n            ],\r\n            &#39;public/static/css&#39;,\r\n            &#39;global.css&#39;,\r\n        );\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;watch&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        gulp.watch(&#39;views/**/*.ejs&#39;).on(&#39;change&#39;, livereload.reload);\r\n\r\n        livereload.listen();\r\n\r\n        gulp.watch(&#39;sources/assets/**/*.scss&#39;, gulp.series(&#39;global:styles&#39;));\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(\r\n        &#39;build&#39;,\r\n        gulp.series(\r\n            gulp.parallel(&#39;global:styles&#39;),\r\n        ),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;dev&#39;, gulp.series(&#39;build&#39;, &#39;watch&#39;));\r\n\r\n    gulp.task(&#39;default&#39;, gulp.series(&#39;build&#39;, &#39;watch&#39;));\r\n\r\nlinks:\r\nhttps://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-livereload\r\n\r\n1.

class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@SpringBootApplication\r\n@EnableConfigurationProperties(OrderConfig.class)\r\npublic class Application {\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n

When a document is deleted, due to the append-only nature of CouchDB, a new revision of the given document is created, consisting solely of its ID, revision, and the field `_deleted` which is true. This &#39;tombstone&#39; as it&#39;s called allows for the deletion to be replicated across all databases. However, the tombstone remains in the database and takes up (albeit very small) space. You could implement this yourself, and just create a revision of the document that looks something like `{&quot;_id&quot;: &quot;0&quot;, &quot;_rev&quot;: &quot;1-62657917&quot;, &quot;_deleted&quot;: true}`. It is important to note that documents with the deleted flag will not be returned in requests anymore.\r\n\r\nThe second option for deletion is `purge`.

Each recording is it&#39;s own document. e.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;2019-10-20T04:51:22.744Z&quot;,\r\n  &quot;_rev&quot;: &quot;1-53e73be51ea76f96e3cfde2de1502439&quot;,\r\n  &quot;locale&quot;: &quot;en&quot;,\r\n  &quot;_attachments&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;recordings.webm&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;content_type&quot;: &quot;audio/webm; codecs=opus&quot;,\r\n    ...\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client application has a single user `clientUser` (so anyone accessing the website becomes `clientUser`). The client user can therefor write to `recordingsDB` but also read from `recordingsDB` which is not desirable because they can read any recordings from `recordingsDB`.\r\n\r\nI went down &quot;write only&quot; database road and came across [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5863731/9236687) answer from 2011. I&#39;m wondering how to implement that. \r\n\r\n## Idea\r\n\r\nSo what I believe would work is if my `recordingsDB` would replicate all of the recordings to a `masterRecordingsDB` where the `clientUser` is no longer a member. After each document from the `recordingsDB` is copied to the `masterRecordingsDB` it would be deleted. \r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\nI have configured a replicator which copies the content from recordingsDB to masterRecordingsDB.\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;_id&quot;: &quot;recordings_to_master_recordings&quot;,\r\n  &quot;_rev&quot;: &quot;3-a6fa84dd89c2ec037353c17f65b4c765&quot;,\r\n

SOLUTION:**\r\n\r\nAdd this line on top of your `work.sh` script `trap exit SIGINT` to have an explicit SIGINT handler:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n#! /bin/bash\r\n\r\ntrap exit SIGINT\r\n\r\nCOUNTER=0\r\nwhile true\r\ndo\r\n    ((COUNTER+=1))\r\n    echo &quot;#${COUNTER} Working...&quot;\r\n    sleep 1\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning `work` executable now prints:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#1 Working...\r\n#2 Working...\r\n#3 Working...\r\n#4 Working...\r\n#5 Working...\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter which it returns back to shell. \r\n\r\n**THE PROBLEM:**\r\n\r\nI found this [webpage][1] linked in a comment to this [question][2] on Unix stackexchange (For the sake of completeness, here also the [webpage linked][3] in the accepted answer.) Here&#39;s a quote that might explain what&#39;s going on:\r\n\r\n&gt; bash is among a few shells that implement a wait and cooperative exit approach at handling SIGINT/SIGQUIT delivery. When interpreting a script, upon receiving a SIGINT, it doesn&#39;t exit straight away but instead waits for the currently running command to return and only exits (by killing itself with SIGINT) if that command was also killed by that SIGINT. The idea is that if your script calls vi for instance, and you press Ctrl+C within vi to cancel an action, that should not be considered as a request to abort the script.\r\n\r\n&gt; So imagine you&#39;re writing a script and that script exits normally upon receiving SIGINT. That means that if that script is invoked from another bash script, Ctrl-C will no longer interrupt that other script.\r\n\r\n&gt; This kind of problem can be seen with actual commands that do exit normally upon SIGINT by design.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI found another Unix stackexchange [answer][4] that explains it even better. If you look at `bash(1)` man pages the following is also quite explanatory:\r\n\r\n&gt; Non-builtin commands run by bash have signal handlers set to the values inherited by the shell from its parent. When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands ignore SIGINT and SIGQUIT in addition to these inherited handlers. \r\n\r\nespecially when considering that:\r\n\r\n&gt; Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped, reset or listed.\r\n\r\nBasically, running `work.sh` runs it in a separate execution environment:\r\n\r\n&gt; When a simple command other than a builtin or shell function is to be executed, it is invoked in a separate execution environment.\r\n\r\nThis includes the signal handlers which (if not explicitly present) will ignore `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT` by default. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://mywiki.wooledge.org/SignalTrap#Special_Note_On_SIGINT\r\n  [2]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/287044/why-does-bash-ignore-sigint-if-its-currently-running-child-handles-it\r\n  [3]: https://www.cons.org/cracauer/sigint.html\r\n  [4]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/356480/377286","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473685/sending-sigint-to-forked-exec-process-which-runs-script-does-not-kill-it/58475470#58475470","title":"Sending SIGINT to forked exec process which runs script does not kill it"}],"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":8920368,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1704428119589089/picture?type=large","display_name":"Faustas Butkus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8920368/faustas-butkus"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571597391,"creation_date":1571579526,"question_id":58473685,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473685","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing shell application with C and encountered a problem that sending SIGINT to process running script won&#39;t stop it.\r\n\r\nSending the same signal to a normal executable works just fine.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\nBash script which just imitates long working script (work.sh):\r\n```\r\n#! /bin/bash\r\n\r\nCOUNTER=0\r\nwhile true\r\ndo\r\n    ((COUNTER+=1))\r\n    echo &quot;#${COUNTER} Working...&quot;\r\n    sleep 1\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\nC code:\r\n```\r\nint main() {\r\n    pid_t pid = fork();\r\n    if (pid == 0) {\r\n        char* cmds[] = { &quot;./work.sh&quot;, NULL };\r\n        if (execvp(cmds[0], cmds) == -1) {\r\n            exit(1);\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        sleep(5);\r\n        kill(pid, SIGINT);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter sending the signal main process ends but script proceeds printing.\r\n\r\nIs signal handling in scripts are somehow different?

Similarly to a regular pointers, **by default,** you can&#39;t connect port to 2 channels simultaneously. \r\n\r\nWhile this may be inconvenient for low-level modeling, this allows to use ports with any kind of high-level channels, like FIFOs or TLM channels.\r\n\r\nLooks like you need something like broadcast port : when you write to such a port message should be written to all connected channels. \r\n\r\nTo create a port that can be binded to a multiple channels, use second template parameter **N** of sc_port :\r\n\r\n    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    //  CLASS : sc_port\r\n    //\r\n    //  Generic port class and base class for other port classes.\r\n    //  N is the maximum number of channels (with interface IF) that can be bound\r\n    //  to this port. N &lt;= 0 means no maximum.\r\n    // ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    template &lt;class IF, int N = 1, sc_port_policy P=SC_ONE_OR_MORE_BOUND&gt;\r\n    class sc_port\r\n\r\n \r\nLets test it:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;systemc.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    SC_MODULE(test) {\r\n      // Create broadcast_port that allows any number of binded channels\r\n      sc_port&lt;sc_signal_inout_if&lt;int&gt;, 0&gt;

in the config of webpack.server.js, then I get the following console error where I am stuck:\r\n&gt;bundle.js:1 Uncaught ReferenceError: module is not defined at bundle.js:1\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea what the problem is and how to fix this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473644/reactjs-server-side-rendering","title":"ReactJS server side rendering"},{"tags":["python","file","flask","python-3.7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571579684,"post_id":58473642,"comment_id":103280533,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473642/how-to-fix-filenotfounderror-errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-error-in-str#comment103280533_58473642"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10984551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92318b0c51d3308329f26a0f5b6be0a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Engin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10984551/engin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":499,"user_id":7211815,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6qt3B.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codrelphi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7211815/codrelphi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571581679,"post_id":58473642,"comment_id":103281089,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473642/how-to-fix-filenotfounderror-errno-2-no-such-file-or-directory-error-in-str#comment103281089_58473642"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10984551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/92318b0c51d3308329f26a0f5b6be0a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Engin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10984551/engin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571614538,"creation_date":1571614538,"answer_id":58478160,"question_id":58473642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58478160","body_markdown":"Ok, i&#39;ve managed to replace the content and then save it to file after uploading it.\r\nHere is the code if anyone else needs.\r\n\r\n    import os\r\n    from chardet import detect\r\n    from app import app\r\n    from flask import render_template, flash, redirect, request, send_from_directory, url_for\r\n    from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\r\n    \r\n    ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = set([&#39;txt&#39;, &#39;srt&#39;])\r\n    target_format = &#39;UTF-8&#39;\r\n    outputDir = &#39;static/coverted&#39;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def allowed_file(filename):\r\n        return &#39;.&#39;

So in subsequent scrolls, you are actually seeing more than one console.log per event, some of them have captured a different `trustedInView` via the closure making it seem that the value is changing when it is not.\r\n\r\nThere are several problems with this code\r\n\r\n1. `useEffect` doesn&#39;t have any dependencies, so it&#39;s being called on every render\r\n2. `useEffect` `removeEventListener` is not really being called when the component unmounts, useEffect expected you to return a function and you are returning whatever the result of removeEventListener is.\r\n3. You are not removing any listener since you are creating a new function and passing it `removeEventListener` instead of the function passed to `addEventListener` another function created everytime.\r\n4. Every render has a new version of `handleNavigation` so even if we were to fix the previous errors we have to make sure that we remove the correct listener. Luckily this is what `useCallback` is for.\r\n\r\nTaking those things into account will look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst handleNavigation = useCallback(() =&gt; { /* ... */ }, [prevPosition, trustedInView])\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() =&gt; {\r\n  window.addEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, handleNavigation);\r\n  return () =&gt; {\r\n    window.removeEventListener(&#39;scroll&#39;, handleNavigation);\r\n  }\r\n}, [handleNavigation])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut even this is problematic since the `prevPosition` is going to change every time destroying the effect, plus is going to get stale for your purposes.  So its better just to use a ref directly without your `usePrevious` hook\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst prevValueRef = useRef(0);\r\n\r\nconst handleNavigation = useCallback(e =&gt; {\r\n  const scrollY = e.currentTarget.scrollY;\r\n  const prevScrollY = prevValueRef.current;\r\n\r\n  // Save the value for the next event\r\n  prevValueRef.current = scrollY;\r\n\r\n  // ...\r\n\r\n}, [trustedInView])\r\n```\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n      \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58473633/react-hooks-prop-value-changing-randomly-between-renders/58480597#58480597","title":"React Hooks, prop value changing randomly between renders"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10878198,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6ce915ffff0412148d20c6cbfc6143eb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kevin Nkonda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10878198/kevin-nkonda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7279,"user_id":2071697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7d1ded508aa80214b01298b83562406?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"skyboyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071697/skyboyer"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58480597,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571642026,"creation_date":1571579161,"last_edit_date":1571642026,"question_id":58473633,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58473633","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to convert a class component, which is a Gatsby Layout component, to a functional component using react hooks to manage state.
