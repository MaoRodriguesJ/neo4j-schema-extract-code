This is so you can play around and figure stuff out more easily when developing locally, where sloppy syntax is less of an issue, before cleaning up your code for production use.  It took me a bit to wrap my head around this, too, but it&#39;s a Good Thing(tm) :P\r\n\r\n# The Justification\r\nJavaScript lets you do pretty much whatever you want: it has no clue what `res` is going to look like, but it assumes you know what you&#39;re doing and if you say `res` is going to have a property called `data`, it just rolls with it.\r\n\r\nThis is great if you&#39;ve got a small project, or if you&#39;re the *only* person who&#39;s ever going to work on it, but it starts to get tricky when the project gets larger, or if you have multiple developers submitting code.  *You* know that `res` has a `data` property, but how does *Samantha* know that?\r\n\r\n## Enter `TypeScript`\r\n[TypeScript][2] is JavaScript...with Types.  Types provide the *shape* of a given object, so everybody involved (including the TypeScript transpiler) knows what&#39;s up.  When you say `res: any[]` , what TS hears is &quot;object `res` is going to be an `Object` of type `Array`&quot;; we *haven&#39;t*, however, told TS anything about the member-items *within* the array, and since it doesn&#39;t know what *kind* of array `res` is going to be, the only things to which we have access are the generic methods and properties of the `Array` type, itself.\r\n\r\n#The Fix\r\nSo, what do we need to do *instead* of `(res: any[])` to make `this.users = res.data.result;` work?\r\n\r\n## Define an Interface for the ResponseObject\r\nWe need to start by telling TS what to expect with a little more detail:\r\n````typescript\r\nexport interface ResponseObject {\r\n  data: {\r\n    result: {};\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n````\r\nNow TS knows that there&#39;s an `Object` called `ResponseObject` that has (at minimum) a `data` property, and that `data` property is *itself* an `Object` that has (again, at minimum) a property called `result`.\r\n\r\n## Tell TypeScript to expect our ResponseObject\r\nWe can plug this into our subscription call like this:\r\n````typescript\r\n.subscribe( (res: ResponseObject) =&gt; {\r\n  this.users = res.data.result; // now it totally DOES like the .data.result part in build --prod!\r\n  console.log(this.users);\r\n});\r\n````\r\n# Wait a sec...\r\nYou may notice that `res` is no longer expected to be an object of type `Array`;  based on the code you posted and the fact you said it worked via `ng serve`, it sounds like you&#39;re expecting a single ResponseObject that delivers an array of UserObjects as the payload on the `data.result` property; if so, the code sample above should work fine.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our `.get()` really *is* returning an *array* of ResponseObjects, we&#39;re going to need to do some extra work.\r\n\r\n## Dealing with an array of ResponseObjects\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s change up our interface declaration, first:\r\n````typescript\r\nexport interface ResponseObject {\r\n  status: number;  /*  It&#39;s OK to exclude things we don&#39;t need,\r\n      but, the status property is going to come in handy when\r\n      we eventually want to write a catch statement for cases\r\n      when the call returns an error instead of the data we\r\n      wanted  */\r\n  data: {\r\n    /*  you can also split up your interface declarations to\r\n        make them easier to read; this has the added benefit of\r\n        allowing us to more easily access the sub-properties of\r\n        our payload later on  */\r\n    result: UserObject;  /*  we&#39;re expecting a single\r\n        UserObject per ResponseObject in this scenario,\r\n        otherwise we&#39;d use:  */\r\n    // result: UserObject[];\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport interface UserObject {\r\n  /*  remember to use the generic type names (lowercase &#39;string&#39;),\r\n      not Primitives (Capitalized &#39;String&#39;) in your interface\r\n      declaration, otherwise you&#39;ll get more errors  */\r\n  id: number;\r\n  name: string;\r\n  email?: string;  /*  the question mark lets you define a\r\n    property that *may* exist, but may not.  Useful if your\r\n    target API only includes parameters with non-null values\r\n    in the ResponseObject   */\r\n  // ...all the other things you want and think will exist\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThen we can mix up our subscription call:\r\n\r\n````typescript\r\n.subscribe(\r\n  // we tell subscribe that we&#39;re expecting an array of ResponseObjects\r\n  (res: ResponseObject[]) =&gt; {\r\n    /*  users needs to be defined as an array to hold onto\r\n        multiple UserObjects; we&#39;re clearing it here to make\r\n        sure we&#39;re only dealing with fresh data and specifying\r\n        that it will be an array of type UserObject  */\r\n    this.users: UserObject = [];\r\n\r\n    /*  the data property isn&#39;t a property of the *array*, but\r\n        of each array *member-item*, so we need a loop  */\r\n    res.forEach(\r\n      (res_item: ResponseObject) =&gt; {\r\n        // add the response object data to our users array\r\n        this.users.push(res_item.data.result);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    // now console log should properly show our array of UserObjects!\r\n    console.log(this.users);\r\n  }\r\n);\r\n````\r\n\r\n***n.b.,*** Please don&#39;t forget to mark this as the Accepted Answer if it does, in fact, answer your question satisfactorily.

Maybe transpiled code is the issue (I know for example that generators created for async methods result in drastically different code).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070589/getting-variable-undefined-inside-try-catch-statement/58070719#58070719","title":"Getting variable undefined inside try...catch statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":339,"user_id":489413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/335e52c6d49c34e99f4653ed7e327920?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Massimiliano Marini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/489413/massimiliano-marini"},"last_editor":{"reputation":339,"user_id":489413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/335e52c6d49c34e99f4653ed7e327920?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Massimiliano Marini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/489413/massimiliano-marini"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569276072,"creation_date":1569275166,"last_edit_date":1569275845,"question_id":58070589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070589","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Vuex, and this is the code inside my `store.js` file.  \r\nI&#39;ve tested the code in the browser e in the node, and it works.\r\n\r\nWhy I&#39;m getting `undefined` inside the `try...catch` statement?\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// the user object is \r\n{ name: &#39;Foo&#39;, email: &#39;foo@bar.com&#39; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nactions: {\r\n    login: async ({commit}, user) =&gt; {\r\n      console.log(&#39;user: &#39;, user) // [OK] print { name: &#39;Foo&#39;, email: &#39;foo@bar.com&#39; }\r\n      try {\r\n        console.log(&#39;user: &#39;, user) // [FAIL] print undefined\r\n      } catch(err) {\r\n        console.error(err)\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070589/getting-variable-undefined-inside-try-catch-statement","title":"Getting variable undefined inside try...catch statement"},{"tags":["javascript","html","objective-c","wkwebview","wkwebviewconfiguration"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1397,"user_id":7833793,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39ecb6373d9ae58817ae85a2f953150a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"R4N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7833793/r4n"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569279589,"creation_date":1569279589,"answer_id":58071135,"question_id":58070588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58071135","body_markdown":"I think you may be slightly confused about `&lt;br&gt;` tags.  `&lt;br&gt;` or `&lt;br /&gt;` are self-closing/void elements/empty tags:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/html/html_elements.asp (under the empty html section)\r\nhttp://xahlee.info/js/html5_non-closing_tag.html\r\n\r\n&gt;`&lt;br&gt;` is an empty element without a closing tag (the `&lt;br&gt;` tag defines a line break):\r\n\r\nSo when you&#39;re subbing in `&lt;br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;` you&#39;re actually subbing in two line breaks.

Changed to `onclick` just for this example but `onload` will fire the method also once on your project. Go ahead and click the table in the example after hitting the &quot;run snippet&quot; button to see result.\r\n\r\nFirst you need a reference to the table object to get the [HTMLTableCollection](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_table.asp) which you&#39;ll then first loop the rows, and then the subsequent cells of each row. You grab the number value from `innerHTML` on each pass and use `parseInt` to get a number instead of a string which you can then compare via expressions in an if statement on each iteration as shown in the example. If a number is not passed, the `try` and `catch` blocks will alert you to error in the script for correction.

Code is developed on Tensorflow/Keras and I am trying models with 3 to 7 layers, each having 16 to 64 LSTM cells. Due to huge data size (around 13.5M sample sequences), I am interested to do my model training in distributed mode by data parallelization over multiple GPUs or multiple PCs.  However, my tries by now have not resulted in any improvement over single system version and I am thinking if it is feasible at all or not.\r\n\r\nMy understanding from data parallelism under Tensorflow/Keras is that there are different workers, a chief, and a parameter server (ps). Model parameters are stored in ps and communicated with workers and chief, and each worker works on a partition of the whole data. Each worker should get the model parameters from ps at the start of each data batch processing, do all the forward and backward propagation and calculate the weight updates and send them back to ps, where the updated model parameters are calculated by chief and stored. Therefore, each worker should read the model parameters before each batch processing.\r\n\r\nMy simulation batch size is 1024, therefore there are about 13K batches in one epoch of data. Training of a model with 87,000 parameters took 412 seconds in my one-gpu system, which means about 30 ms per batch. A more complex model with 1M parameters took 1900 seconds to process one epoch, which means about 146 ms per batch.\r\nNow that I look at the numbers, I am in doubt if data parallelism is helpful. If two GPUs or CPUs want to communicate 100K or 1M parameters, can it be so fast to be done in a few milliseconds to be negligible? My experiments on a two-GPU system (which even doesn&#39;t require data transmission over network) resulted in batch processing time of twice single-GPU. Can it be attributed to the small batch processing time compared to data communication overhead on top of that? If it is, does it mean that my model is not as complex as necessary for distributed learning?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070576/is-distributed-learning-feasible-for-my-application","title":"Is distributed learning feasible for my application?"},{"tags":["r","apply"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33332,"user_id":4895725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e4e5cb5b1f211efd656044dfb0174f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4895725/lmo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569282065,"post_id":58070575,"comment_id":102538234,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously#comment102538234_58070575"},{"owner":{"reputation":63981,"user_id":1422451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sFFvX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Parfait","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1422451/parfait"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569296799,"post_id":58070575,"comment_id":102540775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously#comment102540775_58070575"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7936576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9258cb00a133c71d34f06f7db361030?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Timo aus Hannover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7936576/timo-aus-hannover"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":33332,"user_id":4895725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e4e5cb5b1f211efd656044dfb0174f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4895725/lmo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569336437,"post_id":58070575,"comment_id":102559941,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously#comment102559941_58070575"},{"owner":{"reputation":33332,"user_id":4895725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e4e5cb5b1f211efd656044dfb0174f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"lmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4895725/lmo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569363742,"post_id":58070575,"comment_id":102570938,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously#comment102570938_58070575"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":7936576,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9258cb00a133c71d34f06f7db361030?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Timo aus Hannover","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7936576/timo-aus-hannover"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569403886,"post_id":58070575,"comment_id":102582873,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously#comment102582873_58070575"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1252,"user_id":11908107,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gg8x4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"slava-kohut","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11908107/slava-kohut"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569281655,"creation_date":1569281655,"answer_id":58071319,"question_id":58070575,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58071319","body_markdown":"Here is an example.

Can you give me a hint?\r\n\r\nThanks and greetings\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070575/apply-list-of-functions-to-one-matrix-simultaneously","title":"Apply list of functions to one matrix simultaneously"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","amazon-ec2","aws-sdk"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":492,"user_id":7529276,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/31e1a185c9d97a3efc2b1b631271db3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jorg Roper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7529276/jorg-roper"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569275291,"creation_date":1569275291,"answer_id":58070606,"question_id":58070566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58070606","body_markdown":"Ref: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html\r\n\r\nYou should be able to query the Image ID on line 3?

I have a specific class for the JSX element to be rendered in a specific way, but the of setting the variable disregards this command. The following code is set in the ComponentDidMount function.\r\n\r\n    if (isBrowser) {\r\n          this.setState({dependentOnView: &quot;small&quot;})\r\n      } else {\r\n        this.setState({dependentOnView: &quot;huge&quot;})\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThe JSX attribute in question is the following.\r\n\r\n    &lt;List divided selection class=&quot;specialHighlight&quot; size={this.state.dependentOnView}&gt;&lt;List.Item&gt; &lt;Label color=&#39;blue&#39; horizontal&gt; Delayed - Theorizing Now&lt;/Label&gt; Exchange &lt;/List.Item&gt;&lt;/List&gt;\r\n\r\nThe state is set in the constructor like so, \r\n\r\n    this.state = {\r\n            dependentOnView: &#39;&#39;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong here?\r\n\r\nOf course the package is properly imported, like so,\r\n\r\n    import {BrowserView,MobileView,isBrowser,isMobile} from &quot;react-device-detect&quot;;\r\n\r\nThe css class in question, is being completely ignored by the after runtime.\r\n\r\n    .specialHighlight {\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    margin-top: 65vh;\r\n    line-height: 2vh;\r\n    font-size: 2vh;\r\n    margin-left: 3vw;\r\n  }\r\n\r\nAnswer:\r\nThis is a very niche case, but setting the size in the List element did nothing, but setting the size of the label in the List Item, which what I was trying to do in the first place, worked. Further, as I was going back in the edits I forgot to use {this._state_.whateverattribute}.\r\n\r\nFurther Answer:\r\nUsing className as an attribute means that the native semantic UI css will **overwrite** the css you have inputed, therefore in this instance I used class but in most instances the proper way is to indeed use className.\r\n\r\nFor people looking at the answer in the future:\r\n1. Ensure package is properly imported\r\n\r\n2. Ensure Semantic JSX attribute has state properly inputted\r\n\r\n3. Ensure state is properly set\r\n\r\n4. Try changing the css class setting between _class_ and _className_\r\n\r\n5. Lastly, try setting other elements with the state variable, it&#39;s highly possible for whatever reason semantic won&#39;t allow certain variables to be set with certain elements\r\n\r\n6. If all else fails, change the native css for semantic UI\r\n\r\nBig shoutout to the commentator MikeRos for his input. \r\n\r\n [1]:

I&#39;m using Mongoose to create the User Model to save it to a MongoDB database.

I already set an endpoint with a post request, and I tested this code on Postman and it works. \r\nI&#39;m a beginner, I just watched a NodeJS course in Udemy and I&#39;m following the code pattern I saw there. My question goes to the fact I have to req.body parse every field (username, pass, role) and then create a new User with same fields to create it directly in the database, and for scalability reasons I think this would be a problem, since I&#39;m planning to add more models to my database with a lot of fields.

I&#39;m aiming at an experience like the following.\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; foo = create_something()\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; bar = create_something_else()\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; create_lots_more_stuff()\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; # Hmmmm I&#39;d like to see a list of all the things I have created in my interactive python session.\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; pretty(dir())\r\nfoo     bar\r\nbaz     qux\r\netc     etc_etc\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070536/how-can-you-list-the-contents-of-the-global-namespace-from-within-a-module-in-py","title":"How can you list the contents of the global namespace from within a module in python"},{"tags":["html","xamarin.forms","webview","thumbnails"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539446/jack-hua-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569293908,"post_id":58070535,"comment_id":102540288,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070535/how-to-size-content-in-xamarin-forms-webview#comment102540288_58070535"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5941507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ifqyYSqX1xQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/AvNdsxZB-Qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Brenchley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5941507/david-brenchley"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539446/jack-hua-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569355489,"post_id":58070535,"comment_id":102568378,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070535/how-to-size-content-in-xamarin-forms-webview#comment102568378_58070535"},{"owner":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539446/jack-hua-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569489620,"post_id":58070535,"comment_id":102616579,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070535/how-to-size-content-in-xamarin-forms-webview#comment102616579_58070535"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5941507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ifqyYSqX1xQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/AvNdsxZB-Qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Brenchley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5941507/david-brenchley"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539446/jack-hua-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569708088,"post_id":58070535,"comment_id":102685079,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070535/how-to-size-content-in-xamarin-forms-webview#comment102685079_58070535"},{"owner":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539446/jack-hua-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569923636,"post_id":58070535,"comment_id":102744412,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070535/how-to-size-content-in-xamarin-forms-webview#comment102744412_58070535"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5941507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ifqyYSqX1xQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/AvNdsxZB-Qw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"David Brenchley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5941507/david-brenchley"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569274786,"creation_date":1569274786,"question_id":58070535,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070535","body_markdown":"I need to shrink the size of the WebView and its contents to a smaller thumbnail type view.\r\n\r\nI have html content of templates for postcards showing in a Xamarin Forms WebView.

However, if I e.g. go to full screen, open the app in browser or change the width of the window at all, [this][2] happens. I&#39;ve tried setting column(align=&quot;left&quot;), but that changes nothing (while =&quot;center&quot; moves the 2nd plot slightly to the right), so I am assuming this is already the default. Of course, I can manually move the second plot around by setting the width of the first plot to less than 6 (half), but this requires manually adapting the plot for whichever screen/resolution/window size that views the app. Surely there is another way to automatically set for the second figure to start right where the first one ends that I have not figured out?\r\n\r\nAny help

And if you think about that it makes sense that gems do not contain information about the version control system that was used:\r\n\r\n - There is no need to use Rubygems and Git at the same time. Actually, there is no need to use a version control system at all when you build gems.\r\n - And even if the author used a version control system, there are other version control systems – like SVN or Mercurial for example.\r\n - Even if the author used Git to keep track of their source code changes, they could still create and upload multiple different versions of the gem without doing a single git commit in the meantime.\r\n - And even if the author did a commit for every gem version then – depending on the configuration of the gem and the git repository – both systems can include files which exist on one system but not on the other.\r\n\r\nThat said, the assumption that a specific gem version corresponds with a specific git commit is just wrong.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070483/which-commit-was-a-specific-release-on-rubygems-created-from/58140150#58140150","title":"Which commit was a specific release on rubygems created from?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3070,"user_id":808729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02a0392b3dab439f346eac40fee47dec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"holaSenor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/808729/holasenor"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3070,"user_id":808729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02a0392b3dab439f346eac40fee47dec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"holaSenor","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/808729/holasenor"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":81,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58140150,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569613858,"creation_date":1569274449,"last_edit_date":1569347821,"question_id":58070483,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070483","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a release history, how can I identify which commit a specific version of a gem was created from on rubygems.com?

Recently we had an idea that it would nice to build some kind of framework in the mobile app which would be capable of rendering typical form questions based on the JSON returned by the backend. JSON will contain a list of questions that should be asked during the journey. That is, we agree on the question types and backend will return strings/configurations which frontend will use to build questions of the specific types.\r\n\r\nBasically, to have backend return following JSON:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;questions&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;id&quot;: &quot;54543543&quot;,\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;COMBOBOX&quot;,\r\n                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Random title&quot;,\r\n                &quot;subtitle: &quot;Random subtitle&quot;,\r\n                &quot;options&quot;: [\r\n                    &quot;Text 1&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;Text 2&quot;\r\n                ],\r\n                &quot;selected&quot;: 1\r\n            }\r\n            ...\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt will give us additional flexibility if we would like to:\r\n\r\n- Restructure form flow (add/remove/rephrase/move questions of the existing types) - we won&#39;t need to force customers to update the app if we want to change anything in the form.\r\n- A/B test to see how conversion rate improves or how responses from our integration partner change based on the answers provided by the customers (there are a lot of optional parameters that may influence the results).\r\n- Reuse the same engine to build similar forms for entering other countries - less boilerplate, only purely presentational logic on the mobile app side.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are also drawbacks of this approach:\r\n\r\n- The solution is technically complex - even though it reduces boilerplate, it introduces technical complexity. Nothing like this was built in the company before and many people will be against that (the company, in general, prefers to keep complexity at bay and use only standard approaches/tools as opposed to building in-house solutions).\r\n- It is not entirely flexible - still, the frontend will have to program specific question types (layouts) in the app. Some JSON responses for certain layouts will be very complex and nested to make sure that the frontend is able to build beautiful and functional questions.\r\n- It will be much harder to onboard newcomers on both frontend and backend to maintain this part of the system.\r\n- Fewer people will be willing to review the code - given the fact that frontend pull requests need at least 2 approvals - may take them longer to build/fix anything there.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? My main concern is customer experience - we won&#39;t need to ask customers to update the app. 50%-60% of our customers have auto-updates enabled. Also, flexibility to fix typos/adjust the forms may be very useful, especially if integration partners decide to change their API or if we would like ourselves change the journey and ask more/less information. However, it means that we will have to build our own framework which may get out of hand at some point, especially if the founders leave the company/team.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070473/dynamic-form-rendering-framework-in-mobile-app","title":"Dynamic form rendering framework in mobile app"},{"tags":["java","java-ee","wildfly","classloader","war"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569280369,"post_id":58070472,"comment_id":102537928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war#comment102537928_58070472"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5791432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ad1ed4eb68a31dda8f5130955657f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Punching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5791432/punching"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569763167,"post_id":58070472,"comment_id":102693931,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war#comment102693931_58070472"},{"owner":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569763460,"post_id":58070472,"comment_id":102693995,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war#comment102693995_58070472"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5791432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ad1ed4eb68a31dda8f5130955657f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Punching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5791432/punching"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569764677,"post_id":58070472,"comment_id":102694298,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war#comment102694298_58070472"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5791432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ad1ed4eb68a31dda8f5130955657f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Punching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5791432/punching"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569764192,"post_id":58144616,"comment_id":102694171,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war/58144616#comment102694171_58144616"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":421,"user_id":3162265,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qBnrZGStp8Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADw/7nWsmsjSUoI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Erhard Siegl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3162265/erhard-siegl"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569659142,"creation_date":1569659142,"answer_id":58144616,"question_id":58070472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58144616","body_markdown":"Either you use a Remote Interface which leads to marshalling and unmarshalling (performance) or you introduce a module dependency from the WARs to the EAR by adding deployment.MY_DEPLOYMENT_NAME e.g. to `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`.

can be different solutions.\r\n\r\n1) Package into the EAR those WARs only that use EJBs. Then you can use EJBs via local interfaces. All other WARs can still be deployed independently, and they *don&#39;t need* the same class loader as EAR.\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n\r\n2) Use remote EJBs. Package into WARs the interfaces of EJBs that they use. Again, no need in the same class loader. And if you are worried about performance of remote EJBs, then first test the real p&#252;erformance. Jboss developers have optimized performance a lot. For instance, [read here][1], they optimized EJB calls\r\n\r\n&gt; ... to avoid doing unnecessary server side communication(s) which\r\n&gt; would typically involve network calls, marshalling/unmarshalling etc.\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n3) Analyze dependencies of WARs and EJBs, also dependencies between EJBs on each other. Try to identify 4-5 groups or &quot;clusters&quot; of EJBs and WARs that are very close to each other and that use only a few EJBs from other groups, or even use no EJBs from other groups. Then package such groups into separate EARs. For instance, you can have:\r\n\r\n - A main EAR that provides 20 EJBs responsible for user and permission management\r\n - One EAR with 10 EJBs and 5 WARs for product management\r\n - One EAR with 20 EJBs and 30 WARs for order management\r\n - One EAR with ... EJBs and ... WARs for shipment management\r\n\r\nThen in the most cases you will deploy only one of these EARs and thus your deployment times will be 4-5 times faster.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AS71/Remote+EJB+invocations+via+JNDI+-+EJB+client+API+or+remote-naming+project?_sscc=t","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070472/using-same-classloader-for-ear-and-war/58157042#58157042","title":"Using same classloader for ear and war"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":5791432,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12ad1ed4eb68a31dda8f5130955657f2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Punching","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5791432/punching"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569873784,"creation_date":1569274380,"question_id":58070472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070472","body_markdown":"Currently we have more than 100 wars/ejbs bundled in an ear.\r\nBecause we dont want to deploy all of them always we would like to split \r\nthe deployment in:\r\n\r\n- ejb-ear\r\n - ejb1.jar\r\n - entities.jar\r\n\r\n- first.war\r\n- second.war\r\n- third.war\r\n\r\nHow is it possible to simply lookup the ejb1.jar from one of the deployed wars - if it is possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nI read following document but I can`t figure out how to get this working.\r\n\r\nI can do a lookup on the ejb in the ear but I cant cast it to an Interface.

They go on their profile and upload a file or an image to my server and it is stored under the `media_root` using a form submission. \r\n\r\nMy server is running Django, and *django_user* is the owner of Django and it’s files. However, when a user uploads a file/photo using the form submission, it is placed under the ownership of my servers *root* user. \r\n\r\nI need the ownership to be under *django_user* so that site users can see their uploads without me having to manually change the file owner to *django_user*. Right now, they are getting a permission error because *root* is not who is serving up Django. \r\n\r\n**NOTE**: *django_user* is the one running Django. This didn&#39;t seem clear.\r\n\r\n**Temporary Solution**:\r\n\r\nA temporary solution comes in the form of ErikR&#39;s answer. It is not what I was looking for, but it does help me out a little. His solution allows users to view their photo/file they&#39;ve uploaded without having to wait for me to change the owner/permissions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does still cause files to be uploaded as root. But it is a temporary workaround for the permissions issue, NOT the owner issue.\r\n\r\nHis answer (place in base settings): FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070466/django-when-a-user-uploads-media-to-my-site-it-is-owned-by-the-servers-root-u","title":"Django: When a user uploads media to my site, it is owned by the server&#39;s root user.

widgetList;\r\n      widgetList= [MyStructure(\r\n         id = 1;\r\n         text = &quot;a text&quot;\r\n      )];\r\n\r\nSo, now I could create a list of widget just doing something like this:\r\n\r\n    return new Row(children: widgetList.map((item) =&gt; new MyWidget(item)).toList());\r\n\r\nAnd, in theory, it works but I don&#39;t know how to use it with the swiper.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_swiper/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070451/flutter-swiper-with-a-list-of-widgets","title":"Flutter Swiper with a list of widgets"},{"tags":["angular","angular-cli"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3232,"user_id":4272085,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/947faeb07678e27a6154c14bf5ab75a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gosha_Fighten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4272085/gosha-fighten"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569276969,"post_id":58070447,"comment_id":102537130,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070447/ng-test-cannot-resolve-fs-after-updating-to-angular-8#comment102537130_58070447"},{"owner":{"reputation":5619,"user_id":166850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b28179f40563585163981dfd0c37b86c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RMorrisey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/166850/rmorrisey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3232,"user_id":4272085,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/947faeb07678e27a6154c14bf5ab75a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gosha_Fighten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4272085/gosha-fighten"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513285,"post_id":58070447,"comment_id":102629847,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070447/ng-test-cannot-resolve-fs-after-updating-to-angular-8#comment102629847_58070447"},{"owner":{"reputation":5619,"user_id":166850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b28179f40563585163981dfd0c37b86c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RMorrisey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/166850/rmorrisey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3232,"user_id":4272085,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/947faeb07678e27a6154c14bf5ab75a7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gosha_Fighten","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4272085/gosha-fighten"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569523704,"post_id":58070447,"comment_id":102634592,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070447/ng-test-cannot-resolve-fs-after-updating-to-angular-8#comment102634592_58070447"},{"owner":{"reputation":7585,"user_id":114900,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rafJY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"msanford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/114900/msanford"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569524273,"post_id":58070447,"comment_id":102634826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070447/ng-test-cannot-resolve-fs-after-updating-to-angular-8#comment102634826_58070447"},{"owner":{"reputation":5619,"user_id":166850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b28179f40563585163981dfd0c37b86c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RMorrisey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/166850/rmorrisey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7585,"user_id":114900,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rafJY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"msanford","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/114900/msanford"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569530853,"post_id":58070447,"comment_id":102637554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070447/ng-test-cannot-resolve-fs-after-updating-to-angular-8#comment102637554_58070447"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5619,"user_id":166850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b28179f40563585163981dfd0c37b86c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RMorrisey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/166850/rmorrisey"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569868677,"creation_date":1569868677,"answer_id":58173459,"question_id":58070447,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58173459","body_markdown":"After a long trial-and-error elimination process, I found the culprit:\r\n```\r\nimport {hasOwnProperty} from &#39;tslint/lib/utils&#39;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI accidentally imported a ```tslint``` utility function into my application source code.

There are many things I haven&#39;t done yet. Migrating a baked aspects of my dev site to my live site is one of them. I followed a tutorial to add tags to my website. [Cake Tags Tut][1] Everything on the dev site works perfect. Today I tried to move everything to the live site. I know its not the proper way to do it but I made a list of the changes I made and then moved the files and made the changes on the website. When I go to the URLs I need to use the tags I get an error. I have routes set up for the URLs and everything. Even though on the dev site I don&#39;t even need the routes for the URLs to work. Which makes me wonder about the baking process. After I gave the dev site the bake command the URLS were just there, it created all the skeleton code for the URL localhost/tags/add to work and I was able to start creating tags. Funny thing, all the functionality on the live site is there. When I create a post I can add tags to the DB and they pull fine when editing the post, they even show on the views. The only thing, I cant get to work are the index.ctp, add.ctp and edit.ctp for the tags. If you need any more info please just ask and I will provide it.\r\n\r\nRoute to define url for tags:\r\n\r\n    $routes-&gt;connect(&#39;/tags&#39;, [&#39;controller&#39; =&gt; &#39;Tags&#39;, &#39;action&#39; =&gt; &#39;index&#39;]);\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nI briefly turned on debug mode on the live site.

of this has been covered in other Q&amp;As, but I&#39;ll give a summary here.  (And look for links to add).  Still, good question, it&#39;s useful to collect this all in one place.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**On x86, every asm load is an acquire-load**.  To implement that efficiently, modern x86 HW speculatively loads earlier than allowed and then checks that speculation.  (Potentially resulting in a memory-order mis-speculation pipeline nuke.)  To track this, Intel calls the combination of load and store buffers the &quot;Memory Order Buffer&quot;.\r\n\r\nWeakly-ordered ISAs don&#39;t have to speculate, they can just load in any order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**x86 store ordering** is maintained by only letting stores commit from the store buffer to L1d in program order.\r\n\r\nOn Intel CPUs at least, a store-buffer entry is *allocated* for a store when it issues (from the front-end into the ROB + RS).  All uops need to have a ROB entry allocated for them, but some uops also need to have other resources allocated, like load or store buffer entries, RAT entries for registers they read/write, and so on.\r\n\r\n**So I think the store buffer itself *is* ordered**.  When a store-address or store-data uop executes, it merely writes an address or data into its already-allocated store-buffer entry.  Since commit (freeing SB entries) and allocate are both in program order, I assume it&#39;s physically a circular buffer with a head and tail, like the ROB.  (And unlike the RS).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Avoiding LoadStore is basically free**: a load can&#39;t retire until it&#39;s executed (taken data from the cache).  A store can&#39;t commit until *after* it retires.  In-order retirement automatically means that all previous loads are done before a store is &quot;graduated&quot; and ready for commit.\r\n\r\nA weakly-ordered uarch that can in practice do load-store reordering might scoreboard loads: let them retire once they&#39;re not to be non-faulting but before the data arrives.\r\n\r\nThis seems more likely on an in-order core, but IDK.  So you could have a load that&#39;s retired but the register destination will still stall if anything tries to read it before the data actually arrives.  We know that in-order cores do in practice work this way, not requiring loads to *complete* before later instructions can execute.  (That&#39;s why software-pipelining using lots of registers is so valuable on such cores, e.g. to implement a memcpy.  Reading a load result right away on an in-order core destroys memory parallelism.)\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/52215031/how-is-load-store-reordering-possible-with-in-order-commit goes into this more deeply, for in-order vs. out-of-order.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Barrier instructions\r\n\r\nThe only barrier instruction that does anything for regular stores is `mfence` which in practice stalls memory ops (or the whole pipeline) until the store buffer is drained.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50494658/are-loads-and-stores-the-only-instructions-that-gets-reordered covers the Skylake-with-updated-microcode behaviour of acting like `lfence` as well.\r\n\r\n`lfence` mostly exists for the microarchitectural effect of blocking later instructions from even issuing until all previous instructions have left the out-of-order back-end (retired).

My question is how are these barriers and memory ordering semantics implemented on x86 and ARM micro architecturally ?\r\n\r\nFor store-store barriers, it seems like on the x86, the store buffer maintains program order of stores and commits them to L1D(and hence making them globally visible in the same order). If the store buffer is not ordered, ie does not maintain them in program order, how is a store store barrier implemented ? it is just &quot;marking&quot; the store buffer in such a way that that stores before barrier commit to the cache coherent domain before stores after ? or does the memory barrier actually flush the store buffer and stall all instructions until the flushing is complete ? Could it be implemented both ways ?\r\n\r\nFor load-load barriers, how is load-load reordering prevented ? It is hard to believe that x86 will execute all loads in order! I assume loads can execute out of order but commit/retire in order. If so, if a cpu executes 2 loads to 2 different locations ,how does one load ensure that it got a value from say T100 and the next one got it on or after T100 ? What if the first load misses in the cache and is waiting for data and the second load hits and gets its value. When load 1 gets its value how does it ensure that the value it got is not from a newer store that load 2&#39;s value ? if the loads can execute out of order, how are violations to memory ordering detected ?\r\n\r\nSimilarly how are load-store barriers(implicit in all loads for x86) implemented and how are store-load barriers(such as mfence) implemented ? ie what do the dmb ld/st and just dmb instructions do micro-architecturally on ARM, and what does every load and every store, and the mfence instruction do micro-architecturally on x86 to ensure memory ordering ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070428/how-are-barriers-fences-and-acquire-release-semantics-implemented-microarchitec","title":"how are barriers/fences and acquire, release semantics implemented microarchitecturally?"},{"tags":["angular","ngrx","ngrx-effects"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":7665,"user_id":11487196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4493b1f4bc88550d52d4556bc74c096?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tony Ngo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11487196/tony-ngo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569296238,"post_id":58070427,"comment_id":102540658,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070427/ngrx-not-skipping-successful-action-on-error#comment102540658_58070427"},{"owner":{"reputation":148,"user_id":6466848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/641805695972642/picture?type=large","display_name":"angry somoan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6466848/angry-somoan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":7665,"user_id":11487196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4493b1f4bc88550d52d4556bc74c096?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tony Ngo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11487196/tony-ngo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569305184,"post_id":58070427,"comment_id":102543013,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070427/ngrx-not-skipping-successful-action-on-error#comment102543013_58070427"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":148,"user_id":6466848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/641805695972642/picture?type=large","display_name":"angry somoan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6466848/angry-somoan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569305212,"post_id":58073874,"comment_id":102543021,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070427/ngrx-not-skipping-successful-action-on-error/58073874#comment102543021_58073874"},{"owner":{"reputation":4972,"user_id":10112124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e6297e8a8df7affbe897ed476212148?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"timdeschryver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112124/timdeschryver"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":148,"user_id":6466848,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/641805695972642/picture?type=large","display_name":"angry somoan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6466848/angry-somoan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569333063,"post_id":58073874,"comment_id":102557948,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070427/ngrx-not-skipping-successful-action-on-error/58073874#comment102557948_58073874"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4972,"user_id":10112124,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e6297e8a8df7affbe897ed476212148?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"timdeschryver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10112124/timdeschryver"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569304640,"creation_date":1569304640,"answer_id":58073874,"question_id":58070427,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58073874","body_markdown":"That seems strange, if you have a reproduction I&#39;m happy to take a look.\r\n\r\nCan you verify:\r\n\r\n  - the server does in fact return a `400`\r\n  - do you use interceptors?

Even if more users may request such action at the same time, each of them should obtain different record for reusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe background:\r\n\r\n - We have web application, where many users can do things at the same time.\r\n - there are tables, that grows to infinity, but only few records are active (sometimes like from 100.000 long records is active 1.000 and no chance for reactivating any &quot;deleted&quot;)\r\n - sometimes are tranferred (to other places) just changes, so we mark &quot;deleted&quot; records as such and transfer them to delete records on the other side\r\n - sometimes is needed to transfer the tables (to partial place) as whole and it takes too long\r\n - the data integrity during the transfer is managed by other part of the project and should not do real problems \r\n\r\nWanted:\r\n\r\n - reuse some old and long time &quot;deleted&quot; records for new data\r\n - it is not problem, to have `reuse_me` field in tables (default False, set to True after long time deleted, by some script). It can be safely assumed, that such records are nowhere referenced and do not reference nothing else (the script can delete all refereces from the record and mark only not refereced records, so tree-like structures would be freed in more steps - there are no cyclic structures to free anyway and if they will became, there can be other way to disable them as whole)\r\n - **there is problem, how to pick them to use, when more than one user may try it at the same time** (as side effect of being on web)\r\n\r\nSimple solution (does not work for many cases):\r\n\r\n - some records are easy to write fully at one time by pure SQL (something like `UPDATE car_owners_cross SET deleted=0, resuse_me=0, owner_id=123, car_type_id=456 WHERE deleted=1 AND resuse_me=1 LIMIT 1;` ) and it would (should) select &quot;random free record&quot; and rewrite it, so it is no longer free and there should be no conflict. (also this would be done only if count of free records is higher than say 100, otherwise it would just be INSERTed - so no worrying about not finding free record in concurent access)\r\n\r\nTotal solution:\r\n\r\n - some records are more complicated and needs to be repeatedly updated, until task is done (like attach file, create related records, rewrite it depending on later web input ....) so there is need to know, **which record** was selected for the task for reuse - **and I do not know, how to do that**\r\n - the solution should be Django function returning `id` of reused/created object (or the object with valid id) - like `coc=reuse_or_create(models.Car_Owners_Cross, owner_id=123, car_type_id=456)` or `coc=models.Car_Owners_Cross.reuse_or_create(owner_id=123, car_type_id=456)` - while it would probably need some SQL/cursors/etc magic inside\r\n - I think, the solution would be easy, if there would be a way to get ID of the modified record - so it would take form of  `UPDATE car_owners_cross SET deleted=0, resuse_me=0 WHERE deleted=1 AND resuse_me=1 LIMIT 1;` get **id of that record** and then issue `UPDATE car_owners_cross SET  owner_id=123, car_type_id=456 WHERE id=789` - but **I do not know, how to get id of that record** \r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n - there are plans for new feature, which would make the problem much worse (generating and deleting tons of records regularry, many times for no good use - while user just &quot;plays with settings&quot;) while leaving just few non-`deleted` records after - so it would be big help, to have such feature there from start\r\n - in example above - each Owner can have any number of types of car (and any number of identical car types - so many records would have the same values, except for unique id) as well as any CarType can be owned by any number of Owners\r\n - the real records are way more complicated, but the principe is the same\r\n - the number of (`deleted`) records is already doing problems\r\n - the target is to improve ratio of `valid` to `deleted` records, not necessery to eliminate each and every &quot;deleted&quot; record (so it can keep a pool of `reuse_me` marked records to be sure, that `UPDATE` will get its victim and make new records, even if some `reuse_me` do still exist - the size of the pool can be configured in code, just need be &quot;sane&quot; - say like 3x number of expected concurently logged-in users or something like that\r\n - there is possibility to add other fields to affected tables, to support `reuse_me`, or make `reuse_me` any other type, than boolean\r\n - not all creation of new record will use this possibility (eg. Admin interface would still just plainly use `INSERT` (`coc=Car_Owners_Cross();...;coc.save();`) and some old tools too)\r\n - if this function will be used, all defaults can be &quot;manually&quot; set by code to valid values (would be nice to have them on default values (just to be extra safe - but not exactly requested)\r\n - not all tables will be used this way (and only tables from our own models will be, so no auth.* etc.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070424/how-safely-reuse-database-records-in-mysql-from-django-in-apache","title":"How safely reuse database records in MySql from Django (in Apache)"},{"tags":["arduino","nfc","rfid"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9973,"user_id":2858170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4263428b9b0e0aed365e264c7a2b044?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Piglet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2858170/piglet"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569322300,"post_id":58070423,"comment_id":102551766,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070423/how-to-encode-a-nfc-chip-with-a-website-url-using-a-rc522-module#comment102551766_58070423"},{"owner":{"reputation":295,"user_id":755590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1ee1b65ba11949f6a9ed06773df12efe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Padmanabha V","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/755590/padmanabha-v"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569326792,"post_id":58070423,"comment_id":102554175,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070423/how-to-encode-a-nfc-chip-with-a-website-url-using-a-rc522-module#comment102554175_58070423"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":326,"user_id":5390321,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LrGkNdM2eKQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAgM/lXdKCYkiOzs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Adriano","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5390321/adriano"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569403930,"creation_date":1569403930,"answer_id":58095389,"question_id":58070423,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58095389","body_markdown":"The MF RC522 is a reader IC, not a writer IC from NXP:\r\nhttps://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/rfid+guide.pdf\r\n\r\nThere are some libraries for Arduino that you can use and write (only ISO 14443 A, not B) with an RC522 module - but they are limited and not every RFID-module is able to use it.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want a good library for the RC522, check this:\r\nhttps://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid\r\n\r\nAnd this is the code:\r\n\r\n    mfrc522.MIFARE_Write(blockNumber, bytes, bytesLen);\r\n\r\nWhere the block number is a number from 0 to 15, bytes your array and byteslen the length of your array.\r\n\r\nYou can find a complete tutorial here: https://lastminuteengineers.com/how-rfid-works-rc522-arduino-tutorial/\r\n\r\nTo write a link in this TAG, you can put a link as text (not the good way) or you can write the TAG as &quot;well known type&quot;, using an identifier type (like &quot;https://&quot; or &quot;http://&quot; as code).

The core of that code was a call to a local powershell:\r\n\r\n    using (Runspace runspace=RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(connectionInfo))\r\n            {\r\n\r\n                PowerShell powershell = PowerShell.Create();\r\n\r\n                powershell.AddCommand(Command);\r\n                ...                \r\n                runspace.Open();\r\n                powershell.Runspace = runspace;\r\n                psobjs = powershell.Invoke();\r\n            }\r\n\r\nNow we are running into the problems where Microsoft limits the number of remote PowerShell connections to EXO. Because we are doing multiple calls to the powershell (such as mailboxes, groups, users, rights), we are getting the following error message, &quot;Fail to create runspace because you have exceeded your budget to create runspace&quot;.\r\nI was thinking that perhaps we need to find a way to reuse the runspace, so I have tried to use:\r\nThis is run from a singleton class initialized from a class factory, so I figured I could put \r\n\r\n    Runspace runspace=RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(connectionInfo);\r\n    runspace.Open(); \r\n\r\nHowever I am getting an error message that runspace is in undefined state.\r\nWould anyone by any chance have a good suggestion on how to reuse a runspace properly?\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070417/c-call-to-exchange-online-powershell-need-reuse-runspace","title":"C# call to Exchange Online powershell... need reuse runspace"},{"tags":["google-apps-script","google-classroom"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569282943,"post_id":58070412,"comment_id":102538401,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070412/google-classroom-turnin-method-google-apps-script#comment102538401_58070412"},{"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":3212185,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e975e7ce59b139131ac96f937faa8fa5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shaci","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3212185/shaci"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":38512,"user_id":7108653,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LH2EI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tanaike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7108653/tanaike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569283118,"post_id":58070412,"comment_id":102538430,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58070412/google-classroom-turnin-method-google-apps-script#comment102538430_58070412"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":3212185,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e975e7ce59b139131ac96f937faa8fa5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shaci","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3212185/shaci"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14758,"user_id":7215091,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Olqd1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cooper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7215091/cooper"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569282889,"creation_date":1569274037,"last_edit_date":1569282889,"question_id":58070412,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58070412","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to call turnIn method through google apps script.\r\n(https://developers.google.com/classroom/reference/rest/v1/courses.courseWork.studentSubmissions/turnIn?hl=ru&amp;authuser=1).\r\nI have a teacher and a student in the same domain, both of them have access to my google apps script.

trying to create object pool in C# but I can’t find proper data structure for this task. List&lt;T&gt; looked promising with removing data from the end but unfortunately it misses much needed feature namely combination of GetRange() and RemoveRange(). Using both methods one after another is undesirable as it’s creates new List&lt;T&gt; and copies result thus allocating garbage. It’s especially annoying while dealing with mutable structs. I’m well aware that using mutable structs is not recommend, but for some reason&#160;Unity Team decided to implement Vector3 as struct. \r\n\r\nAlso, I was thinking on using ArraySegment&lt;T&gt; but that approach seems messy. Stack&lt;T&gt; too was a promising collection but unfortunately does not contain PopRange(), PushRange(). \r\n\r\nDo anyone knows about third-part List&lt;T&gt; or other collection that contains such behavior?
