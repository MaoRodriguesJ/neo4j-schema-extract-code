For instance, if you want all your views to be orange, do this:\r\n\r\n    struct BackgroundColorStyle: ViewModifier {\r\n    \r\n        func body(content: Content) -&gt; some View {        \r\n            return content\r\n                .background(Color.orange)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd usage is:\r\n\r\n    Text(&quot;Hello world!&quot;).modifier(BackgroundColorStyle())\r\n\r\nNow, you can - and probably should - expand on this for light/dark mode. In this case, you can use the environment variable `ColorSchmem`:\r\n\r\n    struct BackgroundColorStyle: ViewModifier {\r\n        @Environment (\\.colorScheme) var colorScheme:ColorScheme    \r\n        func body(content: Content) -&gt; some View { \r\n            if colorScheme == .light {\r\n                return content\r\n                    .background(Color.darkGrey)\r\n            } else {\r\n                return content\r\n                    .background(Color.white)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEither way, every `View` using this modifier has their background color defined in one place.

Headers that are set by my services are ignored by Apache and therefore I must put CORS configuration into Apache&#39;s config files in order for CORS headers to be properly applied.\r\n\r\nMy question is, how can I setup Apache so that it leaves CORS configuration for my services to do (pre-flight request, Access-Allow-Origin-Header, ...).\r\n\r\nThis is example of a virtual host configuration:\r\n\r\n    &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;\r\n            ServerName sub.example.com\r\n            Redirect permanent / https://sub.example.com\r\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;VirtualHost *:443&gt;\r\n    \r\n            ServerName sub.example.com\r\n            ServerAlias sub.example.com\r\n    \r\n            SSLEngine On\r\n            SSLProxyEngine On\r\n            SSLCertificateFile &quot;~/chained.pem&quot;\r\n            SSLCertificateKeyFile &quot;~/domain.key&quot;\r\n    \r\n            ProxyPreserveHost On\r\n            ProxyRequests off\r\n    \r\n            &lt;Location &quot;/&quot;&gt;\r\n                    ProxyPass http://localhost:8080/ # location of my service\r\n                    ProxyPassReverse http://localhost:8080/\r\n            &lt;/Location&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;\r\n\r\nCurrently, I need to add something like this for CORS to work:\r\n\r\n     Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin sub.example.com\r\n\r\nHowever, my service can set this header as well on its own, it&#39;s just ignored by Apache and not propagated forward.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155718/apache-propagate-cors-headers-in-reverse-proxy","title":"Apache propagate CORS headers in reverse proxy"},{"tags":["ajv"],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":8479984,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75bf6cfd162ef0a29011d03c5f0f535c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user8479984","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479984/user8479984"},"last_editor":{"reputation":40,"user_id":8479984,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/75bf6cfd162ef0a29011d03c5f0f535c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user8479984","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8479984/user8479984"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569772111,"creation_date":1569763979,"last_edit_date":1569772111,"question_id":58155717,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155717","body_markdown":"I have a schema (Illustration purpose):\r\n\r\n[Schema-link][1]\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  &quot;subjects&quot;:[\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;type&quot;:&quot;english&quot;,\r\n      &quot;days&quot;:{\r\n       &quot;mon&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;,\r\n       &quot;tue&quot;:&quot;yes&quot;

Or is using separate exchange for each operation the only reasonable solution?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155716/multiple-rabbitlisteners-sending-reply-to-same-queue-when-using-sendandreceive","title":"Multiple @RabbitListeners sending reply to same queue when using sendAndReceive() in producer"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","blazor","blazor-server-side"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":31063,"user_id":842935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b3b9d4aa138cb30767b8b1a7a90f027?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dani herrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/842935/dani-herrera"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569766227,"post_id":58155715,"comment_id":102694718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155715/how-to-inject-iurihelper-service-in-blazor#comment102694718_58155715"},{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11484429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d36875bdf03ca6c8d8a8bc7ed5386e69?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SideCode","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11484429/sidecode"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":31063,"user_id":842935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b3b9d4aa138cb30767b8b1a7a90f027?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dani herrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/842935/dani-herrera"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569768150,"post_id":58155715,"comment_id":102695210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155715/how-to-inject-iurihelper-service-in-blazor#comment102695210_58155715"},{"owner":{"reputation":31063,"user_id":842935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b3b9d4aa138cb30767b8b1a7a90f027?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dani herrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/842935/dani-herrera"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569773072,"post_id":58155715,"comment_id":102696444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155715/how-to-inject-iurihelper-service-in-blazor#comment102696444_58155715"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3857,"user_id":147301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5cRaa.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Flores","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/147301/flores"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569764814,"creation_date":1569764814,"answer_id":58155838,"question_id":58155715,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58155838","body_markdown":"You don&#39;t have to, it is injected by default.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155715/how-to-inject-iurihelper-service-in-blazor/58155838#58155838","title":"How to inject IUriHelper service in Blazor?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":31063,"user_id":842935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b3b9d4aa138cb30767b8b1a7a90f027?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dani herrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/842935/dani-herrera"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569773051,"creation_date":1569773051,"answer_id":58156925,"question_id":58155715,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58156925","body_markdown":"`IUriHelper` is now `NavigationManager`.

variable, split the single row into multiple columns (Derived) and then write the results to a table.\r\n\r\nHowever, when trying to increment the variable, I am getting &quot;The collection of variables locked for read and write access is not available outside of PostExecute.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe variable is being updated with a script component.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried moving the code to the PostExecute however at that point, it never seems to increment.\r\n\r\n```vb\r\n\r\nPublic Overrides Sub Input0_ProcessInputRow(ByVal Row As Input0Buffer)\r\n\r\n    Dim MaximumKey As Int32 =

hard to guide you without knowing your use case. One option is using the `TemporalAccessor` interface as a common type for dates with and without month and/or day of month and then put either a `LocalDate`, a `YearMonth` or a `Year` into your variable (the last class is just called `Year` (not `LocalYear`, though it would have been in line with the naming scheme)). For example:\r\n\r\n\t\tList&lt;TemporalAccessor&gt; dates = List.of(\r\n\t\t\t\tLocalDate.of(2019, Month.OCTOBER, 3), // full date\r\n\t\t\t\tYearMonth.of(2019, Month.NOVEMBER), // no day of month\r\n\t\t\t\tYear.of(2020)); // no month or day of month\r\n\r\nWhat can we use this for? One example:\r\n\r\n\t\tfor (TemporalAccessor ta : dates) {\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(ta);\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Year: &quot; + ta.get(ChronoField.YEAR));\r\n\t\t\tif (ta.isSupported(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Month: &quot; + ta.get(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR));\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Month: undefined&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tif (ta.isSupported(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH)) {\r\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Day: &quot; + ta.get(ChronoField.DAY_OF_MONTH));\r\n\t\t\t} else {\r\n\t\t\t\tSystem.out.println(&quot;Day: undefined&quot;);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\nThis outputs:\r\n\r\n&gt;     2019-10-03\r\n&gt;     Year: 2019\r\n&gt;     Month: 10\r\n&gt;     Day: 3\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     2019-11\r\n&gt;     Year: 2019\r\n&gt;     Month: 11\r\n&gt;     Day: undefined\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     2020\r\n&gt;     Year: 2020\r\n&gt;     Month: undefined\r\n&gt;     Day: undefined\r\n\r\nWhether or how well it fulfils your requirements I cannot tell.\r\n\r\nUsing `ChronoField` constants for access is low-level, so you may want to wrap the `TemporalAccessor` in a nice class with nice getters. For example:\r\n\r\n    public class PartialDate {\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate TemporalAccessor date;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic PartialDate(Year year) {\r\n    \t\tdate = year;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic PartialDate(Year year, int month) {\r\n    \t\tdate = year.atMonth(month);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic PartialDate(Year year, int month, int day) {\r\n    \t\tdate = year.atMonth(month).atDay(day);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic Year getYear() {\r\n    \t\treturn Year.from(date);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \tpublic OptionalInt getMonthValue() {\r\n    \t\tif (date.isSupported(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR)) {\r\n    \t\t\treturn OptionalInt.of(date.get(ChronoField.MONTH_OF_YEAR));\r\n    \t\t} else {\r\n    \t\t\treturn OptionalInt.empty();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t\r\n    \t// A similar getDay method\r\n    \t\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou may extend the class to your needs. Maybe you want constructors that accept a `Month` enum constant and/or a `YearMonth` object directly and/or getters that return those types wrapped in `Optional`s.\r\n\r\n**Link:** [Oracle tutorial:

But the tutorials that I&#39;ve found use cPanel or other management tools that I don&#39;t think that I have access to.\r\n\r\nThe other method is to try and copy every file from my current webhost using ftp, but I don&#39;t know how to connect to the website and copy all files.\r\nSomehow I&#39;m  having problems downloading the files from my website to my computer to move them to the new server.\r\n\r\nIs there a simple step that I&#39;m missing on how to log into the website to copy the file structure from wordpress?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any responses.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155680/how-to-copy-file-structure-from-wordpress-website-to-new-host","title":"How to copy file structure from wordpress website to new host"},{"tags":["actionscript-3","flash","actionscript","drawing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":605,"user_id":2242244,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4b2d19f387a7573689e6bc2a9907ac7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"elolelo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2242244/elolelo"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569764605,"post_id":58155677,"comment_id":102694281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155677/draw-letters-game-by-action-script-3#comment102694281_58155677"},{"owner":{"reputation":10570,"user_id":2057709,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0R41X.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"VC.One","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2057709/vc-one"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570173055,"post_id":58155677,"comment_id":102836997,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155677/draw-letters-game-by-action-script-3#comment102836997_58155677"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9886621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YjuwxBHSIxY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACEc/McquzkVjRYQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"karem mohsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9886621/karem-mohsen"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9886621,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-YjuwxBHSIxY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACEc/McquzkVjRYQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"karem mohsen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9886621/karem-mohsen"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569764020,"creation_date":1569763685,"last_edit_date":1569764020,"question_id":58155677,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155677","body_markdown":"i am a beginner in Action script 3 and i have a task to create a small game for kids  which let them draw Alphabet Letters in English by tracing points ,and i need help in this game coding, any ideas ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155677/draw-letters-game-by-action-script-3","title":"Draw Letters Game by action script 3"},{"tags":["php","woocommerce","shipping","shipping-method"],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":1336479,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1483131093/picture?type=large","display_name":"user9909","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1336479/user9909"},"last_editor":{"reputation":17907,"user_id":1305969,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wlo8z.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zx485","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1305969/zx485"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569786303,"creation_date":1569763685,"last_edit_date":1569786303,"question_id":58155676,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155676","body_markdown":"I know there are some similar questions like [this one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47409734/display-shipping-cost-on-product-page-woocommerce), but in all of them the questioner tried to get a general solution. \r\n\r\nI know it is not easy because in Woocommerce the Shipping methods are only available when a customer adds a product to the cart.

This is a function that takes &#39;x&#39; as an input and then do a process on that &#39;x&#39; which is adding &#39;1&#39; to it and thing return the output to &#39;y&#39;. In this simple example the input type is a number, and the output type is also a number. However, in programming this might not always be the case. For example, you can have a function that takes a word as an input then counts how many character in that word and return the total number of character in that word. But maybe you don&#39;t need to know that number. Maybe you just need to store it in a database and come back to it later. In that case, you function would not have to return the number or return anything. It should just save it to the database. What about if you already have that word in the database and you don&#39;t have its length there. Your function in that case does not have to take the word as an input it should go to the database by itself, take the word, count the characters, and save the result in the database. You see, fundamentally we still have an input, process, and an output, but the input &amp; output are not being passed in or out to or from the function directly, the functions is taking care of getting its input and returning is output. So it really depends on what you want your function to do.\r\n\r\nAbout the code you posted. Look at the `play` function it takes `songNumber` as an input and its type is `int`, then it is doing some processing like creating a `Player` object and using the `songNumber` as part of the actual song file name. Then its output is the song being played from your speaker. The sound you hear is the actual output. You don&#39;t need any other output beside the sound. That is why in the code its returning `void`. In the other hand the output of the second function `buildKey` is a `widget` of type `Expanded` that can be used inside to code. `buildKey` function also takes a `color` &amp; a `songNumber` as an input. Inside `buildKey` `Expanded` widget is being created. Inside that widget `FlatButton` is being created also. The first input (`color`) is being used to specify the `FlatButton` Color while the second input (`songNumber`) is passed the `FlatButton` `onPressed` function. `onPressed` function when are triggered by pressing the button it will call `player` function giving it the `songNumber` previously passed.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155637/didnt-understand-where-to-use-void-function-and-return-type-function/58156578#58156578","title":"Didn&#39;t understand where to use Void function and Return type function"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3266714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98addcac148e75b561183cfaa880aea1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Akhil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3266714/akhil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569790322,"creation_date":1569763444,"question_id":58155637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155637","body_markdown":"I am really new to programming and while learning Dart function I come to a program which has but I couldn&#39;t understand what makes them to use different function one with return value and another without. \r\nBoth will called during main program and both subprograms complete the task without returning any value(at least I didn&#39;t see anything like that),\r\nCan anyone point out why one have to use return type function.\r\n\r\n    import (....)\r\n    \r\n    void main() =&gt; runApp(XylophoneApp());\r\n    \r\n    class XylophoneApp extends StatelessWidget {\r\n    \r\n    //Void Fuction\r\n      void player(int songNumber) {\r\n        final player = AudioCache();\r\n        player.play(&#39;note$songNumber.wav&#39;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    //Function with return\r\n      Expanded buildKey({colors, songNumber}) {\r\n        return Expanded(\r\n          child: FlatButton(\r\n            color: colors,\r\n            onPressed: () {\r\n              player(songNumber);\r\n            },\r\n          ),\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n    //Call in main function\r\n    buildKey(colors: Colors.red, songNumber: 1),","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155637/didnt-understand-where-to-use-void-function-and-return-type-function","title":"Didn&#39;t understand where to use Void function and Return type function"},{"tags":["react-native","axios","postman"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":657,"user_id":8182248,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/idgBb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kishan Bharda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8182248/kishan-bharda"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569772205,"creation_date":1569772205,"answer_id":58156823,"question_id":58155633,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58156823","body_markdown":"Nothing mistakes in your `axios` syntax but, your `imageData` variable should contain `uri`, `name` and `type` properties. \r\n\r\nExample :\r\n```lang-js\r\nformData.append(&quot;receipt&quot;, {\r\n\turi: imageUri, //uri of image\r\n\tname: imageName, //name of the image\r\n\ttype: typeOfImage //type of the image like &#39;image/jpg&#39; or  &#39;image/png&#39; \r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep everything as it is.

Or error means something different and problem is not here?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155606/problem-starting-nginx-which-is-unexpected","title":"problem starting nginx / which &#39;}&#39; is unexpected?"},{"tags":["html","css","pure-css"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":6218173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b57aebfb558423cd9efef0fef0be622a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6218173/majid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569763779,"post_id":58155657,"comment_id":102694063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155604/how-to-use-the-pure-css/58155657#comment102694063_58155657"},{"owner":{"reputation":175,"user_id":12020232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yc0xO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ObnoxiousNerd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12020232/obnoxiousnerd"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":61,"user_id":6218173,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b57aebfb558423cd9efef0fef0be622a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6218173/majid"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569765024,"post_id":58155657,"comment_id":102694400,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155604/how-to-use-the-pure-css/58155657#comment102694400_58155657"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":175,"user_id":12020232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yc0xO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ObnoxiousNerd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12020232/obnoxiousnerd"},"last_editor":{"reputation":175,"user_id":12020232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Yc0xO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ObnoxiousNerd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12020232/obnoxiousnerd"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569765069,"last_edit_date":1569765069,"creation_date":1569763526,"answer_id":58155657,"question_id":58155604,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58155657","body_markdown":"Well, it seems you are using a CSS which needs pre-processor, like Sass or Less.

From your error message, the function that causes this error is the ```maxret_opt()``` function. This is a function called by ```optimize.portfolio()```, as you can see from the steps, likewise ```optimize.portfolio()``` is called by ``` meanvar.efficient.frontier()```, itself called by ```create.EfficientFrontier()```, which is from your script. \r\n\r\nNow to the error. Looking at the source code of the ```maxret_opt()``` function, I find the following:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nfunction (R, moments, constraints, target, solver = &quot;glpk&quot;, \r\n  control = NULL) \r\n{\r\n  stopifnot(&quot;package:ROI&quot; %in% search() || requireNamespace(&quot;ROI&quot;, \r\n    quietly = TRUE))\r\n  plugin &lt;- paste0(&quot;ROI.plugin.&quot;, solver)\r\n  stopifnot(paste0(&quot;package:&quot;, plugin) %in% search() || requireNamespace(plugin, \r\n    quietly = TRUE))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe ```solver``` argument is passed as &quot;glpk&quot;. The object ```plugin``` is saved as the a string by concatenating the strings &quot;ROI.plugin.&quot; and &quot;glpk&quot; (saved in ```solver```). The ```search()``` function returns attached packages, in the form of &quot;package:PerformanceAnalytics&quot;. That is why in the ```stopifnot()``` call, &quot;package:&quot; is concatenated with the string in plugin, which gives the string &quot;package:ROI.plugin.glpk&quot;. This is then checked if this string is among the strings returned by ```search()```, it also tries to attach the package with the ```|| requireNamespace(plugin, quietly = TRUE))```. If the string isn&#39;t in the attached packages, it uses the string to attach the package. If both of these fail, then the function is stopped. \r\n\r\nTherefore, you need to install the ```ROI.plugin.glpk``` package. You should also install ```ROI.plugin.quadprog```. I installed both and the example efficient frontier works for me. This is a long winded answer, but hopely you can learn how to debug errors in the future using the logic above.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155569/portfolioanalytics-error-while-creating-efficient-frontier/58157393#58157393","title":"PortfolioAnalytics error while creating efficient frontier"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":11127541,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mcsaDH8wnZY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re9KnEdSI2st7JCr4Wk8lzwmGMEnQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Omar Omeiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11127541/omar-omeiri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58157393,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569776645,"creation_date":1569763024,"question_id":58155569,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155569","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to run portfolio optimization problems, everything runs smoothly, except when I try to create the efficient frontier. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried to mess around with all the function parameters, I&#39;ve installed all packages and plugins recommended by the documentation.

Can someone at least give me a hint on whats going on?\r\n\r\nThe code I have is pretty simple, but my main conclusion is that I don&#39;t have any problems in it since I get the same error while running the code located in: https://github.com/R-Finance/PortfolioAnalytics/blob/master/demo/demo_efficient_frontier.R\r\n\r\nmy code:\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- portfolio.spec(colnames(monthly_returns_with_rf[,-selic_col]))\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- add.constraint(portfolio = base_pf, type = &#39;full_investment&#39;)\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- add.constraint(portfolio = base_pf, type = &#39;long_only&#39;)\r\n\r\n    moments &lt;- set.portfolio.moments(monthly_returns_with_rf[,-selic_col], portfolio = base_pf, method = &#39;boudt&#39;, k = 3)\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- add.constraint(portfolio = base_pf, type = &#39;box&#39;, min = 0, max = 0.4)\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- add.objective(portfolio = base_pf, type = &#39;return&#39;, name = &#39;mean&#39;)\r\n\r\n    base_pf &lt;- add.objective(portfolio = base_pf, type = &#39;risk&#39;, name = &#39;var&#39;)\r\n\r\n    ef_fr &lt;- create.EfficientFrontier(R=monthly_returns_with_rf[,-selic_col], portfolio=base_pf, type=&quot;mean-StdDev&quot;, match.col = &#39;StdDev&#39;)\r\n\r\n    opt_base &lt;- optimize.portfolio(monthly_returns_with_rf[,- selic_col], portfolio = base_pf, optimize_method = &#39;ROI&#39;)\r\n    print(opt_base)\r\n\r\n\r\nth error message I get is:\r\n\r\n    Error in maxret_opt(R = R, constraints = constraints, moments = moments, : paste0(&quot;package:&quot;, plugin) %in% search() || requireNamespace(plugin,  .... is not TRUE\r\n    Traceback:\r\n\r\n    1. create.EfficientFrontier(R = monthly_returns_with_rf[, -selic_col], \r\n     .     portfolio = base_pf, type = &quot;mean-StdDev&quot;, match.col = &quot;StdDev&quot;)\r\n    2. meanvar.efficient.frontier(portfolio = portfolio, R = R, n.portfolios = n.portfolios, \r\n     .     risk_aversion = risk_aversion, ... = ...)\r\n    3. optimize.portfolio(R = R, portfolio = portfolio, optimize_method = &quot;ROI&quot;, \r\n     .     ... = ...)\r\n    4. maxret_opt(R = R, constraints = constraints, moments = moments, \r\n     .     target = target, solver = solver, control = control)\r\n    5. stopifnot(paste0(&quot;package:&quot;, plugin) %in% search() || \r\n    requireNamespace(plugin, \r\n     .     quietly = TRUE))\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!\r\nThank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155569/portfolioanalytics-error-while-creating-efficient-frontier","title":"PortfolioAnalytics error while creating efficient frontier"},{"tags":["flutter","carousel","gesturedetector"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":10469707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9a08T.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Milan Ciganović","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10469707/milan-ciganovi%c4%87"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569828891,"post_id":58160510,"comment_id":102708409,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155567/switch-images-with-gesturedetector-in-flutter/58160510#comment102708409_58160510"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569806720,"creation_date":1569806720,"answer_id":58160510,"question_id":58155567,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58160510","body_markdown":"You can reference package https://pub.dev/packages/swipedetector or use it directly. &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nit use onHorizontalDrag to detect and allow Velocity and Displacement &lt;br&gt;\r\ncode snippet of swipedetector &lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\n          onHorizontalDragStart: (dragDetails) {\r\n\t\t\tstartHorizontalDragDetails = dragDetails;\r\n\t\t  },\r\n\t\t  onHorizontalDragUpdate: (dragDetails) {\r\n\t\t\tupdateHorizontalDragDetails = dragDetails;\r\n\t\t  },\r\n\t\t  onHorizontalDragEnd: (endDetails) {\r\n\t\t\tdouble dx = updateHorizontalDragDetails.globalPosition.dx -\r\n\t\t\t\tstartHorizontalDragDetails.globalPosition.dx;\r\n\t\t\tdouble dy = updateHorizontalDragDetails.globalPosition.dy -\r\n\t\t\t\tstartHorizontalDragDetails.globalPosition.dy;\r\n\t\t\tdouble velocity = endDetails.primaryVelocity;\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif (dx &lt; 0) dx = -dx;\r\n\t\t\tif (dy &lt; 0) dy = -dy;\r\n\t\t\tdouble positiveVelocity = velocity &lt; 0 ?

Sass, `&amp;` is short-hand for &#39;the current selector up to this point`, which means you&#39;ll always get all the selectors you&#39;re nested in, up to the root.\r\n\r\nOne workaround would be to have `colorSet` take the selector as an argument, rather than mixing inside the :\r\n\r\n    .land{\r\n       @mixin colorSet($selector){\r\n   \r\n           #{$selector}__fruit{\r\n

this is a strong argument for minimizing nesting as much as possible (one of many). What you&#39;re expressing, if I understand it right, is: &quot;Any fruit of a yellow tree, _which is growing on land_ should be yellow&quot;. Maybe that&#39;s right, but are you anticipating trees which are not growing on land? Should &quot;Yellow trees growing in water have blue fruits&quot;, or does that not make any sense?\r\n\r\nIf you remove the nesting, so that anything which uses `colorSet` is at the top level, the problem goes away.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155563/how-to-select-self-but-not-full-compiled-parent-selector-using-scss/58155810#58155810","title":"how to select

mentioned by @ImaginaryHuman072889 in the comment section, parenthesis (or rather the lack of them) is the issue.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples:\r\n\r\n    =(B7-C6+A1)/(C6+A1)\r\n\r\nEvaluates to: `-0.47254000/155.5` which is `-0.003038842`\r\n\r\n    =(B7-C6+A1)/C6+A1\r\n\r\nEvaluates to: `(-0.47254000)/C6+A1` which evaluates to: `-0.47254000/154,5+A1` which evaluates to: `0.99694...`\r\n\r\nAnother option would be:\r\n\r\n    =(B7-(C6+A1))/(C6+A1)\r\n\r\nwhich evaluates to -0.0159.\r\n\r\nObviously the lesson here is that: `3-2+1` evaluates differently (answer = 2) to `3-(2+1)` which is zero.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nSo while the basic math would be:\r\n\r\n    Percentage = Part/Total\r\n\r\nYou will have to play around with the parenthesis because I can&#39;t tell if you meant to plus `A1` before or after the first deduction. The answer is either my first option included above or the third, but the one thing you don&#39;t have to do is do the `*100`.

make a formArray from data\r\n\r\nImagine you has a data like\r\n\r\n    [\r\n     {code: &#39;one&#39;,desc: &#39;One1&#39;,id: 1},\r\n     {code: &#39;two&#39;,desc: &#39;Two1&#39;,id: 2},\r\n     {code: &#39;three&#39;,desc: &#39;Three1&#39;,id: 3}\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nTo create a formArray it&#39;s useful has a function that, received an object and return a FormGroup\r\n\r\n    createFormGroup(data):FormGroup\r\n    {\r\n       data=data|| {code:&#39;&#39;,desc:&#39;&#39;,id:0}\r\n       return new FormGroup({\r\n           code:new FormControl(data.code,Validators.required),\r\n           desc:new FormControl(data.desc,Validators.required),\r\n           id:new FormControl(data.id,Validators.required)\r\n       })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nif we call to the function with an object return a formGroup, if we call the function with null, return also a FormGroup with the elements empty\r\n\r\nWhen you has the data you can do simple\r\n\r\n    this.myFormArray=new FormArray(this.data.map(x=&gt;this.createFormGroup(x)))\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s each element of data convert to a formGroup, the formArray will be an array with this elements. map transform each element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;this.createFormGroup(x)&quot;\r\n\r\nIf you has a service that return the data you subscribe\r\n   \r\n    this.myService.getData().subscribe(res=&gt;{\r\n         this.myFormArray=new FormArray(res.map(x=&gt;x.this.createFormGroup(x)))\r\n    })\r\n\r\n//your service has a method like\r\n\r\n    getData()\r\n    {\r\n         return this.httpClient(&quot;http:myUrl&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe good of this aproach is that to add a new element to the FormArray you only need make\r\n\r\n    this.formArray.push(this.createFormGroup(null)) \r\n\r\nTo remove\r\n\r\n    this.formArray.removeAt(index)\r\n\r\nIn [stackblitz][1] has a little example of all this. Well, in service I use the rxjs operator `of` normally was a httpClient.get(url). Only I put the part of create the formArray, \r\n\r\nNOTE: I use the contructor of FormGroup and the constructor of FormArray, but you can use BuilderForm like\r\n\r\n    createFormGroup(data):FormGroup\r\n    {\r\n       data=data|| {code:&#39;&#39;,desc:&#39;&#39;,id:0}\r\n       return this.fb.group({\r\n           code:[data.code,Validators.required],\r\n           desc:[data.desc,Validators.required],\r\n           id:[data.id,Validators.required]\r\n       })\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd use\r\n  \r\n    myFormArray=this.fb.array(res.map(x=&gt;x.this.createFormGroup(x)))\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-trnsnk?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58155551/mat-table-with-dynamically-adding-rows-and-editable-fields-in-a-row-with-validat/58157308#58157308","title":"mat table with dynamically adding rows and editable fields in a row with validatons"}],"owner":{"reputation":131,"user_id":3728092,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002144476570/picture?type=large","display_name":"AkRoy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3728092/akroy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58157308,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569775849,"creation_date":1569762887,"question_id":58155551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58155551","body_markdown":"I have just started working on the Angular reactive forms and i was trying to build a table which is inside a form. \r\n\r\nThe table has add new feature by clicking it new empty row will be inserted in the table. the existing rows will be in edit mode by default and they are validated.\r\nThe table data will be saved with a single save button which is out of the table but inside the form.\r\nI tried the below code\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    constructor(private router: Router, private fb: FormBuilder) { }\r\n      columnsToDisplay: string[];\r\n      dataList;\r\n      copyDataList;\r\n      rows: FormArray = this.fb.array([]);\r\n      formGroup: FormGroup = this.fb.group({ actualsVolumeData: this.rows });\r\n\r\n      ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.columnsToDisplay = [&#39;id&#39;, &#39;code&#39;, &#39;desc&#39;];\r\n\r\n        this.formGroup = this.fb.group({\r\n          columns: this.columnsToDisplay,\r\n        });\r\n        this.copyDataList = [];\r\n        this.dataList = [];\r\n        let list = [\r\n          {\r\n            code: &#39;one&#39;,\r\n            desc: &#39;One1&#39;,\r\n            id: 1\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            code: &#39;two&#39;,\r\n            desc: &#39;Two1&#39;,\r\n            id: 2\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            code: &#39;three&#39;,\r\n            desc: &#39;Three1&#39;,\r\n            id: 3\r\n          },\r\n        ];\r\n        this.copyDataList = new MatTableDataSource(list);\r\n        this.dataList = new MatTableDataSource(list);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      onAdd() {\r\n        let newRow = {\r\n          id: this.dataList.data.length + 1,\r\n          code: undefined,\r\n          desc: undefined\r\n        }\r\n        this.copyDataList.data.push(newRow);\r\n        this.dataList = new MatTableDataSource(this.copyDataList.data);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      onSubmit() {\r\n\r\n      }\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;form [formGroup]=`formGroup`&gt;\r\n      &lt;button mat-button (click)=`onAdd()`&gt;Add&lt;/button&gt;\r\n      &lt;table mat-table [dataSource]=`dataList` [formArrayName]=`actualsVolumeData` class=`mat-elevation-z8`&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;ng-container matColumnDef=`id`&gt;\r\n          &lt;th mat-header-cell *matHeaderCellDef&gt;
