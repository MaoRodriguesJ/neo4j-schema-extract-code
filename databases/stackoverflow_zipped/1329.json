This is with the assumption that initial start up is slow for your app to load this new model so you can&#39;t interrupt the running version because it will disrupt your traffic at that time.\r\n\r\nTo deploy versions, follow the official guide [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/deploying-apps#deploying_additional_versions_and_services) and then to warm up and migrate traffic use the guide [here](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/admin-api/migrating-splitting-traffic).\r\n\r\nTo automate this process you can use the Admin API -- the question will be how you get the model to a specific location for the new version. I would recommend using same file name for the model so that your actual code stays the same consistently per version. With that, you should be able to build that directory and deploy the app with the new version programmatically every day -- but it depends on the rest of your setup and how you are storing and automating any other part of the process.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225918/google-app-engine-automatically-re-deploy-once-a-day-to-update-machine-learning/58273801#58273801","title":"Google App Engine: Automatically re-deploy once a day to update machine learning model?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478,"user_id":11928088,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bfd5f5ed70a37e684199988a6973e4da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrei Tigau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11928088/andrei-tigau"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570533809,"creation_date":1570533809,"answer_id":58285426,"question_id":58225918,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58285426","body_markdown":"This sounds like a very complex process, but what I can told is that after you did all your previous settings for things to be right, you can also use Cloud Build in order to automate the deployments on App Engine.

I can upload the model somewhere (say, Google Cloud Storage) but, ultimately, each instance needs to find out about the existence of this new model, download it, and load it into memory/initialize it; this takes time, so I&#39;d like to only do this once per day/on start up. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m currently wondering - is there a way to auto-redeploy the App once a day or automatically restart the instances?

My requirement is that the type that is used under the hood, is the specified one, because it doesn&#39;t take the same time to multiply two `int` than two `double`. One option would be to have a function for each type, but I was exploring other approaches, like trying to reuse the same function. Since `c` is statically typed, this doesn&#39;t seem trivial to me.\r\n\r\nMy approach of reusing the same function is the following. Lets say for example, that I want to add two one dimensional vectors, which can be of any type:\r\n```c\r\nint a[] = {1, 2, 3};\r\nint b[] = {4, 5, 6};\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr it can also be:\r\n```c\r\nfloat a[] = {1, 2, 3};\r\nfloat b[] = {4, 5, 6};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I would like to add both vectors, but with a generic function that doesn&#39;t know on compile time the types. My first idea was to use `void*` in the function declaration, and once inside the function, cast the vectors to the correct type. However, my implementation looks quite nasty.\r\n\r\n```c\r\nvoid testVariableInput(void *a, void *b, void *out, int m, int type)\r\n{\r\n  int *aInt, *bInt, *outInt;\r\n  float *aFloat, *bFloat, *outFloat;\r\n  double *aDouble, *bDouble, *outDouble;\r\n\r\n  if (type == 1)\r\n  {\r\n    aInt = (int*)a;\r\n    bInt = (int*)b;\r\n    outInt = (int*)out;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)\r\n    {\r\n      outInt[i] = aInt[i] + bInt[i];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else if (type == 2)\r\n  {\r\n    aFloat = (float*)a;\r\n    bFloat = (float*)b;\r\n    outFloat = (float*)out;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)\r\n    {\r\n      outFloat[i] = aFloat[i] + bFloat[i];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  else if (type == 3)\r\n  {\r\n    aDouble = (double*)a;\r\n    bDouble = (double*)b;\r\n    outDouble = (double*)out;\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++)\r\n    {\r\n      outDouble[i] = aDouble[i] + bDouble[i];\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  if (type == 1)\r\n  {\r\n    out = (void*)outInt;\r\n  }\r\n  else if (type == 2)\r\n  {\r\n    out = (void*)outFloat;\r\n  }\r\n  else if (type == 3)\r\n  {\r\n    out = (void*)outDouble;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then just call the function. Not sure if the `(void*)` casting is needed though.\r\n```c\r\nfloat a[] = {1, 2, 3};\r\nfloat b[] = {4, 5, 6};\r\nfloat c[] = {0, 0, 0};\r\ntestVariableInput((void*)a, (void*)b, (void*)c, 3, 2);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the last parameter `2` is the type `1=int`, `2=float`, `3=double`\r\n\r\nI couldn&#39;t find any related example. Is there any design pattern for this? Or maybe there is a simpler way of archiving this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225901/variable-input-type-in-a-function","title":"Variable input type in a

A pattern of a fixed-number-of-lines explanation and a fixed-number-of-lines data regularly repeat in the file. How can I read the file in Dask Dataframe chunk by chunk in which the explanation lines are ignored?\r\n\r\nI successfully wrote a lambda function in the skiprows argument of the pandas.read_csv to ignore the explanation lines and only read the data lines. I converted the pandas-entered code to dask one but it does not work. Here you can see the dask code written by replacing pandas.read_csv with dd.read_csv:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# First extracting number of atoms and hence, number of data lines:\r\nwith open(filename[0],mode=&#39;r&#39;) as file: # The same as Chanil&#39;s code\r\n    line = file.readline()\r\n    line = file.readline() \r\n    line = file.readline()\r\n    line = file.readline() # natoms\r\n    natoms = int(line)\r\n\r\nskiplines = 9 # Number of explanation lines repeating after nnatoms lines of data\r\n\r\ndef logic_for_chunk(index):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;This function read a chunk &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    if index % (natoms+skiplines) &gt; 8:\r\n       return False\r\n    return True\r\ndf_chunk = dd.read_csv(&#39;trajectory.txt&#39;,sep=&#39; &#39;,header=None,index_col=False,skiprows=lambda x: logic_for_chunk(x),chunksize=natoms)\r\n\r\n```\r\nHere the indexes of the dataframe is line numbers of the file. Using above code, at the first chunk, lines 0 to 8 in file are ignored, then the lines 9 to 58 are read. At the next chunk, the line 59 to 67 are ignored and then a natoms-size chunk from line 68 to 117 are read. This happens until all the data snapshots are read.\r\nUnfortunately, while the above code works well in pandas, it does not works in dask. How can I implement a similar procedure in dask dataframe?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225846/filtering-input-file-with-chunksize-and-skiprows-using-line-number-as-index-in-d","title":"Filtering input file with chunksize and skiprows using line number as index in dask dataframe"},{"tags":["java","linked-list"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8734,"user_id":1326913,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ec6f3b4e7f3399ff8564b3538aee5e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ᴇʟᴇvᴀтᴇ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1326913/%e1%b4%87%ca%9f%e1%b4%87v%e1%b4%80%d1%82%e1%b4%87"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570131721,"post_id":58225844,"comment_id":102826784,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225844/how-to-implement-by-writing-own-addfirst-method-what-else-do-i-need-to-add#comment102826784_58225844"},{"owner":{"reputation":9708,"user_id":845414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fbe63f77ce3f9656c62b27db4d8583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Johannes Kuhn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/845414/johannes-kuhn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570131799,"post_id":58225844,"comment_id":102826816,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225844/how-to-implement-by-writing-own-addfirst-method-what-else-do-i-need-to-add#comment102826816_58225844"},{"owner":{"reputation":9708,"user_id":845414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fbe63f77ce3f9656c62b27db4d8583b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Johannes Kuhn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/845414/johannes-kuhn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570131822,"post_id":58225844,"comment_id":102826824,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225844/how-to-implement-by-writing-own-addfirst-method-what-else-do-i-need-to-add#comment102826824_58225844"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8734,"user_id":1326913,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ec6f3b4e7f3399ff8564b3538aee5e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ᴇʟᴇvᴀтᴇ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1326913/%e1%b4%87%ca%9f%e1%b4%87v%e1%b4%80%d1%82%e1%b4%87"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570131889,"creation_date":1570131889,"answer_id":58225920,"question_id":58225844,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58225920","body_markdown":"It looks to me like you have implemented the `addFirst` method, but you need to implement a `toString()` method so that you can print out the contents of the list.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public String toString() {\r\n        String s = &quot;&quot;;\r\n        Node n = first;\r\n        while (n != null) {\r\n            s += n.data + &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n            n = n.next;\r\n        }\r\n        return s;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPrints:\r\n\r\n&gt; c\r\n&gt; &lt;br /&gt;2\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225844/how-to-implement-by-writing-own-addfirst-method-what-else-do-i-need-to-add/58225920#58225920","title":"how to implement by writing own addFirst method?

Here is my main class:\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class MyApp {\r\n  private JFrame entireSwingApp;\r\n\r\n  // Dependency-injection module\r\n  private MyAppModule module = new MyAppModule();\r\n\r\n  public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n    new MyApp().run();\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  private void run() {\r\n    \r\n    entireSwingApp = module.injectEntireSwingApp();\r\n\r\n    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() -&gt; {\r\n      JFrame.setDefaultLookAndFeelDecorated(true);\r\n\r\n      entireSwingApp.pack();\r\n      entireSwingApp.setVisible(true);\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove, the `entireSwingApp: JFrame` property is the main window of the Swing app, and contains **everything** else that is inside the app (the menu, all the various screens, panels, components, **the event listeners**, etc..._everything_).\r\n\r\nSo the `run` method is executing from inside the main application thread, and so is the `MyAppModule#injectEntireSwingApp` DI injector method. Meaning that, the way I currently have it set up, everything (included event listeners) is _created_ on the main app thread, and hence, outside of the **Event Dispatcher Thread (EDT)**.\r\n\r\nHowever, I then invoke `entireSwingApp.setVisible(true)` from inside the `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` lambda. My hope here is that although I&#39;m _creating_ all the GUI code from outside the EDT, that by doing this I&#39;ll somehow be _running_ the GUI code on the EDT.\r\n\r\nIs this a pretty typical set up for Swing/GUI components and dependency injection? Given my setup above, will my GUI code correctly run on the EDT?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225843/swing-dependency-injection-and-the-edt-by-example","title":"Swing, Dependency Injection and the EDT by Example"},{"tags":["c++","mfc","ribbon","cmfcribbonpanel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570132697,"post_id":58225841,"comment_id":102827210,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon#comment102827210_58225841"},{"owner":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570135052,"post_id":58225841,"comment_id":102828147,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon#comment102828147_58225841"},{"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570147696,"post_id":58225841,"comment_id":102831411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon#comment102831411_58225841"},{"owner":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570150181,"post_id":58225841,"comment_id":102831888,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon#comment102831888_58225841"},{"owner":{"reputation":17003,"user_id":1312382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FL8Fg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Aconcagua","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1312382/aconcagua"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570179799,"post_id":58225841,"comment_id":102839860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon#comment102839860_58225841"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570201621,"post_id":58232790,"comment_id":102850562,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon/58232790#comment102850562_58232790"},{"owner":{"reputation":1503,"user_id":1284927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B4DBf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thomiel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1284927/thomiel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44185,"user_id":522663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":98,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OKOEw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jonathan Wood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/522663/jonathan-wood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570294155,"post_id":58232790,"comment_id":102871137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225841/hide-show-add-or-remove-buttons-from-ribbon/58232790#comment102871137_58232790"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1503,"user_id":1284927,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/B4DBf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thomiel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1284927/thomiel"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570178400,"creation_date":1570178400,"answer_id":58232790,"question_id":58225841,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58232790","body_markdown":"10 years ago, before ribbon resource files were introduced, adding buttons programmatically in ``CMainFrame::OnCreate`` was actually the only way, if you opted for a ribbon gui.

[This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13945777/7389264) provides a quick look at a few of them, if you don&#39;t want to read the documentation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225834/python-error-typeerror-input-expected-at-most-1-arguments-got-3-betting-si/58225902#58225902","title":"Python error: &quot;TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3&quot; (betting simulator)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":709,"user_id":1428102,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OEl5y.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"abhilb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1428102/abhilb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570132007,"creation_date":1570132007,"answer_id":58225955,"question_id":58225834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58225955","body_markdown":"```\r\ndeposit = int(input(&quot;How much would you like to deposit - you have $&quot; + str(bal) + &quot; on you right now:    &quot;))\r\n            \r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nwithdrawal = int(input(&quot;How much money would you like to withdraw - you have $&quot;+ str(credcard) + &quot; on your card&quot;))\r\n        \r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225834/python-error-typeerror-input-expected-at-most-1-arguments-got-3-betting-si/58225955#58225955","title":"Python error: &quot;TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3&quot; (betting simulator)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":5257980,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16d86579af100816eaa687ddefe7c03f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anilkumar Battaram","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5257980/anilkumar-battaram"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570132501,"creation_date":1570132501,"answer_id":58226067,"question_id":58225834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58226067","body_markdown":"change input line from \r\n\r\ndeposit = int(input(&quot;How much would you like to deposit - you have $&quot;, bal,&quot; on you right now:    &quot;))\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\ndeposit = int(input(&quot;How much would you like to deposit - you have $&quot;+str(bal)+&quot; on you right now:    &quot;))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225834/python-error-typeerror-input-expected-at-most-1-arguments-got-3-betting-si/58226067#58226067","title":"Python error: &quot;TypeError: input expected at most 1 arguments, got 3&quot; (betting simulator)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12161155,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCfHk3qOzFA6RBUNljH9iJZ7IsbvYaPYCkUONxhng=k-s128","display_name":"Bob Andrews","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161155/bob-andrews"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":4,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570362454,"creation_date":1570131460,"last_edit_date":1570362454,"question_id":58225834,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58225834","body_markdown":"I decided that I would write a code to simulate a betting game, where you guess the number the dice will land on.

went back to the problem today, and realized that the issue is not even limited to these booleans. Even if I ignore the booleans and try to use keycodes to register modifier keys being pressed, that does not work (using @samanime code), at least not on Firefox, because apparently my firefox does not trigger a keydown/keyup (or keypress) event when I press the modifier keys like ctrl or alt. It does trigger normally on other keys like the character keys for example.\r\n\r\nIt works on Chrome though.\r\n\r\nIs there some compatibility problem that I&#39;m not aware of?

can try to modify your code as follows\r\n\r\n1.replace\r\n\r\n    public static RecyclerView.Adapter mAdapter;\r\n\r\nwith\r\n\r\n    public RecyclerAdapter mAdapter;\r\n\r\n2.just init value of variable `mAdapter `, not recreate a new repeated variable mAdapter.\r\nSo replace the following code: \r\n\r\n      RecyclerAdapter mAdapter = new RecyclerAdapter(mEmails, this);\r\n\r\nwith \r\n\r\n     mAdapter = new RecyclerAdapter(mEmails, this);\r\n\r\n3.Remove code `RecyclerAdapter mAdapter = new RecyclerAdapter(mEmails, this);`,because variable `mAdapter ` has been initialized above.\r\n\r\n       switch (id)\r\n        {\r\n            case Resource.Id.bottomDelete:\r\n              // remove this code\r\n              //RecyclerAdapter mAdapter = new RecyclerAdapter(mEmails, this);\r\n              mAdapter.DeleteItem(RecyclerAdapter.listPosition);\r\n\r\n            break;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nThere are two `bottom_bar_menu.xml`  in your app, one is in  `layout` folder, another is in `menu` folder, accroding to your code , you can move `bottom_bar_menu.xml` file from `layout` folder to `menu` folder,just overwritting the original one in `menu` folder.Besides,delete the one in `layout` folder.In other words, only one such file is kept in folder `menu`.\r\n\r\nInder to prevent code crashes,you need to add a judgment condition in method `public void DeleteItem(int position)` as follows:\r\n\r\n     public void DeleteItem(int position)\r\n        {\r\n            if (mEmails!=null &amp;&amp; mEmails.Count&gt;0) {\r\n               mEmails.RemoveAt(position);\r\n               NotifyDataSetChanged();\r\n              NotifyItemChanged(listPosition);\r\n            }\r\n

I understand it may not be the best place to ask, but will appreciate any advice.\r\n\r\nThe way it works with slurm, I use the `sbatch` command to send a `script.sh` file for parallel computation with different parameters. My `script.sh` can be simplified to basically containing a single command ```srun python3 py_script.py```. I have omitted the unnecessary details.\r\n\r\nFinally the `py_script.py` contains the following infinite cycle (the number of runs is not known beforehand):\r\n```\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\n    try:\r\n        &lt;calculate condition&gt;\r\n        if condition == 0:\r\n            print(&quot;Finishing.&quot;)\r\n            sys.exit(0)\r\n        &lt;do stuff otherwise&gt;\r\n\r\n    except Exception as e:\r\n        print(&quot;Encountered error&quot; + e )\r\n        sys.exit(-1)\r\n\r\n    print(&#39;Calculating&#39;)\r\n    &lt;do calculations&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy problem is that when the `condition==0` is met (I checked it always happens), the script prints &quot;Finishing&quot; to the output file, but apparently continues running, as if `sys.exit(0)` was not processed by SLURM. I see the running code (R) in the `squeue` output.\r\nAt the same time, I&#39;m sure the cycle has stopped because I don&#39;t see &quot;Calculating&quot; printing any longer in the log, and the log is not updated anymore.\r\nSo it&#39;s not the issue mentioned in \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/29277082/sys-exit-not-exiting-in-python .\r\nI thought it might be due to that I&#39;m in the `try... catch...` block, but answers to the previous question \r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/21553327/why-is-except-pass-a-bad-programming-practice\r\nclearly indicate that `Exception` does not include things like `SystemExit`, so I should be able to exit. \r\nWhat annoys me even more is that this behavior does not always occur, but only on some runs from the batch (all similar). It also did not seem to happen before the last update of the `SLURM` system, but here I am not sure.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea of what may be going on?\r\n\r\nCan it be the same issue as here?\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081736/r-parallel-job-hangs\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225773/parallel-calculation-in-slurm-does-not-always-exit-after-sys-exit0-in-python","title":"Parallel calculation in SLURM does not always exit after sys.exit(0) in Python"},{"tags":["python","data-structures","mergesort"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10103,"user_id":1822698,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/725a332cc5b93972e715f071b631f4a8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"slider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1822698/slider"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570134851,"creation_date":1570134851,"answer_id":58226508,"question_id":58225771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58226508","body_markdown":"You&#39;re not returning the merged list in your `merge_sort` method in your `else` condition.

is a problem with the templated `std::function`. It&#39;s not *one* `std::function`, but *many*. The compiler will create more and more global data as you use more types.\r\n\r\nAlso, template argument deduction will not work, since the `std::function` variable is templated, not the `operator()` of the `std::function`.\r\n\r\nAlso, you don&#39;t need C++20 to have this problem, try this with C++14:\r\n    \r\n    // equivalent to the templated lambda, just different syntax\r\n    auto t = [](auto tmp){std::cout &lt;&lt; tmp &lt;&lt; std::endl;};\r\n\r\n&gt; But what if I need to specify the exact type via std::function&lt;&gt;? (don&#39;t rely on auto).\r\n\r\nThe thing is each lambdas has a unnamed unique type that cannot be written. `auto` is the *only* way to create a variable of a lambda type.\r\n\r\nUse `std::function` only when you need type erasure, when you need a variable of an unknown type but known interface (like a `operator()`). A `std::function` is *not free* and has *runtime* and *binary size* cost. It&#39;s a type erasure wrapper for callable type.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNow what if you really need the `std::function`?\r\n\r\nWell, `std::function` can only deal with known type. For example, this will work:\r\n\r\n    std::function&lt;void(int)&gt; t = []&lt;typename T&gt;(T arg) { /* ... */ }; \r\n\r\nBut will only calle the `int` version of the lambda.\r\n\r\nAsking `std::function` to have a templated `operator()` is like asking for a virtual templated function.

Same result.\r\n\r\nHowever, If I put the Google Analytics stuff in a function outside of the click, then it works. The GA code doesn&#39;t do anything but submit to google analytics, as per the GA documentation.

The user fills out a form on the previous page and then submits the Ajax form. The form validates that everything, including payment, is good. If it is not, it stays on the same page with an error (hence the AJAX), but if it is good, then it redirects to the confirmation page via:\r\n\r\n    var url = &#39;@Url.Action(&quot;PYGConfirmationPost&quot;, &quot;PYG&quot;)&#39;;\r\n\r\nWhich loads a view that looks like the image below. The drop-down consists of any emails that were added on the previous screen. So it&#39;s very simple. There are only 3 things of jQuery/JavaScript on the page. One is google analytics. the other two are below the image.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![Confirmation Page][1]][1]\r\n\r\n    //Prevents user from going back to the form. Used and works on many Views.\r\n    history.pushState(&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;../Home/Index&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    //auto submit in 30 seconds\r\n    $(document).ready(function () {\r\n    \r\n        setTimeout(function () {\r\n            $(&quot;#PreSubmit&quot;).trigger(&#39;click&#39;);\r\n        }, 30000);\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n    //After 30 seconds, submit GA and then submit the form.\r\n    $(&#39;#PreSubmit&#39;).click(function () {\r\n        //Submit google analytics here\r\n        $(&quot;#submit&quot;).trigger(&#39;click&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the method it calls. I put a break point at the top and the &#39;return RedirectToAction&#39;. For some reason, once it gets to the bracket ( } ) right below the return Redirect... it will jump back up to the top and start the method over.\r\n**EDIT:** I deleted everything except the return RedirectToAction and it is still doing the loop. \r\n\r\n\r\n        [RequireAuth]\r\n        [HttpPost]\r\n        public ActionResult PYGConfirmationPost(PYG SignUp)\r\n        {\r\n          //EDIT: The code in the controller isn&#39;t the issue. I deleted everything except for the return statement and it still does the strange loop.\r\n\r\n            return RedirectToAction(&quot;Index&quot;, &quot;Home&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\nIt consistently will run the method 2x, but if I step through it, it will do it anywhere from 2-6x. I usually give up after 6x, so it may do more. One time, it only did the method once.\r\n\r\nI have tried moving the RedirectToAction under OperationKillTheCookies() and it didn&#39;t fix it. I tried changing RedirectToAction to View and it didn&#39;t fix it. \r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe the time limit from jQuery was affecting it, but no matter how fast or how slow I allow the loop to go, it behaves the same.  \r\n\r\n**Edit** I created a test using selenium web driver (specifically, chrome driver). It does not loop the method when the test method is ran.\r\n\r\n**Edit 2** It does not do this from every computer. 2 other people have tried it and it worked as desired a couple times each. However, 2 other people have tried it and it fired off too many times. I have no idea what the issue could be.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

When using ```QTableView```, I have the subtree correctly displayed, however, only for the first level, as ```QTableView``` ignores nested indexes. With ```QTreeView``` no items are displayed.\r\n\r\nI know that ```QTreeView``` expects the children to be on the first column, but I would assume this to be relative to the ```rootIndex```. To add, setting the ```rootIndex``` to ```item2```, I get the intended behavior, although for the wrong column / subtree.\r\n\r\nOne solution would be to separate the model into two smaller models, but I want to understand what the problem is.\r\n\r\nI am thankful for any comments on how to display the ```subtree``` with a ```QTreeView```.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58225673/how-to-make-qtreeview-display-a-subtree-not-on-the-first-column","title":"How to make QTreeView display a subtree not on the first column"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8104}
