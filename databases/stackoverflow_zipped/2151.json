It was a little unclear to me the location of the `if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:`, but the point here is that you need to keep everything that needs to run once there. Put outside of it only important stuff shared between all processes. For example, a working code on windows could be:\r\n```\r\nimport time\r\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\r\nimport collections\r\n\r\ndef Alter(x):\r\n    vectx = x.vectx\r\n    vecty = x.vecty\r\n    Z = (vectx + vecty)\r\n    return Z\r\n\r\nvalue = collections.namedtuple(&#39;value&#39;, [&#39;vectx&#39;, &#39;vecty&#39;])\r\n    \r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:  \r\n    choice = input(&quot;Do you wish to start program?

I mean this is illegal:\r\n\r\n    public @interface Bar extends MyBaseAnnotation{\r\n    }\r\n\r\n That&#39;s I am not able to have a base `@interface` for all my custom annotation class `Foo` and `Bar`. So, if I have a new custom annotation created, I need to add more `else if` condition in above method checking code, which sucks!  Is there anyway to get rid of this problem? What I want to achieve is to generalize my method checking code to :\r\n\r\n    for (Method m : methods) {\r\n         if (m.isAnnotationPresent(MyBaseAnnotation.class)) {\r\n             ...\r\n

I&#39;ve played around with my ```$filter``` but can&#39;t seem to get any results out. I&#39;m using a similar aggregation for querying within just the ```subdomains``` array and it works fine, I&#39;m just struggling with the array within an array and wondering if I need a different approach.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029425/mongodb-aggregation-on-multiple-nested-arrays","title":"MongoDB Aggregation on multiple nested

results:\r\n\r\n[![seamless wrapped texture array][10]][10]\r\n\r\nIf bilinear filtering is enabled, there are still some artifacts at the borders of the textures. But these artifacts have to be zoomed in quite close to see.

And it can be applied to destructors as well. Destructors however are special, normal rules don&#39;t apply to them. For example destructor in `Derived`, named `~Derived()` is matched with destructor in `Base`, named `~Base()`, even though formally they have different names (or do they? what is a name here anyway?).\r\n\r\nAnother difference between destructors and typical functions is that destructors are always called up the inheritance chain, regardless of implementation. And so you cannot &quot;replace&quot; destruction, you can only &quot;extend&quot; it. Note that (unlike normal functions) calling base class destructor from derived destructor is a mistake.\r\n\r\nThe chained destruction call starts at the class you are refering to at the moment. What I mean is\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nBase* inst = new Derived();\r\ndelete inst;\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill call `~Base()` because the variable `inst` is `Base*` even though it was constructed from a derived class. At this point &quot;virtual logic&quot; applies: if `~Base()` is not virtual then normal destruction procedure fires for `Base` class, without being aware that the actual object is `Derived*`, i.e. `~Base()` and all its parent desctuctors (there are none in this particular case) are executed. Which is wrong. But if it is virtual then it will actually jump to the correct class, `Derived`, and the correct destruction procedure is invoked: first `~Derived()`, then `~Base()`. [See this godbolt.org][1] and play around: add and remove &quot;virtual&quot; in base destructor to see the difference (look at the left column only, lines with colored background are those that are actually called).\r\n\r\nAll in all: yes, you can use `~Derived() override {}`. I always use &quot;override&quot; where appropriate, it&#39;s nice to know which functions are derived from virtuals. Also the rule of thumb is: if `Base` is virtual (meaning any function is virtual) then its destructor should be virtual as well. Remember this well and it will help you avoid some problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/z/iC1JkL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029416/overriding-a-destructor-c/58030069#58030069","title":"Overriding a destructor - C++"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4130,"user_id":1964969,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0879c1954a7ee8660f80eafdf9f66776?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yury Schkatula","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1964969/yury-schkatula"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568989813,"creation_date":1568989813,"answer_id":58030344,"question_id":58029416,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030344","body_markdown":"As far as I know, some of C++ linter tools (like clang-tidy) already have a checking mode that could complain that your derived class doesn&#39;t mark derived virtual destructor with &quot;override&quot; clause.

Also note that trying to do something like using a variable to hold the application name will not work, since the scripting terminology for each application is looked up when the script is compiled.\r\n\r\n###(Edit from comments)###\r\n\r\nTo open the URL of the current **Safari** tab with **Firefox** (version 69.0.1 in Mojave), you can do something like:\r\n\r\n    tell application &quot;Safari&quot; to set theURL to (get URL of current tab of front window)\r\n    tell application &quot;Firefox&quot;\r\n        activate\r\n        open location theURL\r\n    end tell\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029412/why-does-script-editor-not-like-this-edit/58032401#58032401","title":"Why does Script editor not like this edit?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12095723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDMjIzKJYZ1MI8SwCXdMQmNWGoUTsgh_nDN2Two=k-s128","display_name":"Meadow Maker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095723/meadow-maker"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12095723,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDMjIzKJYZ1MI8SwCXdMQmNWGoUTsgh_nDN2Two=k-s128","display_name":"Meadow Maker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095723/meadow-maker"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569181975,"creation_date":1568986362,"last_edit_date":1569175315,"question_id":58029412,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029412","body_markdown":"I got his script:\r\n\r\n ```   tell application &quot;Safari&quot;\r\n\tset vURL to URL of current tab of window 1\r\nend tell\r\n\r\ntell application &quot;Google Chrome&quot;\r\n\tif windows ≠ {} then\r\n\t\tmake new tab at the end of window 1 with properties {URL:vURL}\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tmake new window\r\n\t\tset URL of (active tab of window 1) to vURL\r\n\tend if\r\n\t\r\n\tactivate\r\nend tell\r\n\r\n```\r\nI&#39;d really like to be able to just quickly open the tab I&#39;m using in Safari in Firefox beause... \r\n\r\nI&#39;m told have to add more text here so, Skip this paragraph. ... a site I use a lot has some great features in Firefox but it can be slow to load so I like to switch backwards and forwards between the two. \r\n\r\n\r\nWhy won&#39;t it work if I change &quot;Google Chrome&quot; to &quot;Firefox&quot;:\r\n```\r\ntell application &quot;Safari&quot;\r\n\tset vURL to URL of current tab of window 1\r\nend tell\r\n\r\ntell application &quot;Firefox&quot;\r\n\tif windows ≠ {} then\r\n\t\tmake new tab at the end of window 1 with properties {URL:vURL}\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tmake new window\r\n\t\tset URL of (active tab of window 1) to vURL\r\n\tend if\r\n\t\r\n\tactivate\r\nend tell\r\n```\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029412/why-does-script-editor-not-like-this-edit","title":"Why does Script editor not like this edit?"},{"tags":["sql-server","asp.net-core","hangfire"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5558,"user_id":1324741,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Awrr0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Derek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1324741/derek"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569332046,"creation_date":1569332046,"answer_id":58081549,"question_id":58029407,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58081549","body_markdown":"Try creating the database manually in production, without adding any tables.

of the things you can do to resolve this is to specifically request a json format on your response by adding the corrent request headers\r\n\r\n    Accept: application/json\r\ntry it like so \r\n\r\n\tclient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(&quot;application/json&quot;));\r\n\r\nNow if the server pays attentions to the request headers it will return a json back to you.\r\nIt might be defaulting to xml because there is no such header in your request OR the server only supports returning xml responses.\r\n\r\nEDIT: If you can not get the server to return json, you can convert your xml string response to json string. Take a look at this [example][1]. After the convertsion you can return your json string normally from your controller.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nOk, try out this sample below:\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\r\n    var content = new FormUrlEncodedContent(new[]\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;client_id&quot;, &quot;&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;scope&quot;, &quot;&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;grant_type&quot;, &quot;authorization_code&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;redirect_uri&quot;, &quot;&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;code&quot;, &quot;&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t\tnew KeyValuePair&lt;string, string&gt;(&quot;client_secret&quot;,&quot;&quot;)\r\n    \t\t\t});\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\tAADTokenResponse TokenResponse = null;\r\n    \t\t\tstring _baseAddress = string.Format(&quot;https://yourTargetDomain.com/&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\tusing (var client = new HttpClient())\r\n    \t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\tclient.BaseAddress = new Uri(_baseAddress);\r\n    \t\t\t\tclient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();\r\n    \t\t\t\tclient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue(&quot;application/json&quot;));\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tvar responseMessage = await client.PostAsync(&quot;targetApiSegment&quot;, content);\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\t\tif (responseMessage.IsSuccessStatusCode)\r\n    \t\t\t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tvar responseString = await responseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n    \t\t\t\t\tTokenResponse = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;AADTokenResponse&gt;(responseString);\r\n    \t\t\t\t}\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/ConvertXmlToJson.htm\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029378/returning-json-via-webapi/58029571#58029571","title":"Returning JSON via WebApi"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11427197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eeaa0f727a62333b799d48774930cc7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AW Kingston","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11427197/aw-kingston"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568989269,"post_id":58030041,"comment_id":102462814,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029378/returning-json-via-webapi/58030041#comment102462814_58030041"},{"owner":{"reputation":1042,"user_id":1946260,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28108e71072d1faede871a5ed7c45508?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Unicorno Marley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946260/unicorno-marley"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11427197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eeaa0f727a62333b799d48774930cc7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AW Kingston","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11427197/aw-kingston"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568990748,"post_id":58030041,"comment_id":102463623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029378/returning-json-via-webapi/58030041#comment102463623_58030041"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1042,"user_id":1946260,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28108e71072d1faede871a5ed7c45508?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Unicorno Marley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946260/unicorno-marley"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":11427197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/eeaa0f727a62333b799d48774930cc7e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"AW Kingston","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11427197/aw-kingston"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568990071,"last_edit_date":1568990071,"creation_date":1568988726,"answer_id":58030041,"question_id":58029378,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030041","body_markdown":"I think in this case, `FormUrlEncodedContent` is the wrong choice, and you&#39;d want to use `StringContent` instead, similar to this:\r\n\r\n    var content = new StringContent(HttpUtility.UrlEncode(values), Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n\r\n    var response = await client.PostAsync(&quot;https://URL.com/Token&quot;, content);\r\n\r\nThe reason being, I dont think FormUrlEncodeContent has an overload to accept adding content type.\r\n\r\nAnother alternative would be to switch to using SendAsync rather than PostAsync, as SendAsync has some additional flexibility.

Enumeration happens automatically in that case as it still has context to the database to retrieve the properties.\r\n\r\n    var posts = new List&lt;Posts&gt;();\r\n    using (var context = new BloggingContext())\r\n    {\r\n        var blogs = context.Blogs.Include(blog =&gt; blog.Posts).ToList();\r\n        foreach(var p in blogs.Posts)\r\n        {\r\n           posts.add(p);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nEntity Framework does not automatically load navigation properties (ie you wont automatically get the child objects of your object) due to a concept called Lazy Loading which is enabled by default.\r\n\r\nImaging you have a massive relational database and it automatically pulled all related objects when you did a simple query. Your very simple query could have huge implications if it auto loaded all relations. Could be a potential nightmare. Now there is a way to turn off lazy loading by that is out of the context of this question. Please refer to the following link for some more light reading and more detailed explanation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data\r\n\r\nIn kind of a real world example to model, Imagine you had an interaction with two friends, John and Jane.\r\n\r\nYou talk with John on the phone and ask him what his plans are in the morning. He is attending a meeting at 9:30.\r\n\r\nYou then hangup and call Jane and tell her about John&#39;s plans for the day. You tell Jane about the 9:30 meeting and then she asks &quot;Who all will be in the meeting?&quot;\r\n\r\nYou have no clue because you didn&#39;t asks John when you talked to him. You KNOW that meetings have attendees but you have no idea who they are because you didn&#39;t ask John when you talked to him. You also know that meetings have agendas, locations, call in numbers, ect. It would be pretty inefficient to get all the explicit details of the meeting if you did not care about every detail. John would probably stop answering your phone calls if you operated this way every time you interacted with him.\r\n\r\nBUT in a different scenario you had asked John who will be there (aka included the properties then you would have the answer) because you know that Jane will want to know when you talk to her later that day.\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\nIf you were on a conference call with John and Jane and the question was asked (still within the database context when we wanted to find additional info) then the info would be readily available because John is on the call.\r\n\r\nHope this makes sense.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029337/getting-null-values-while-iterating-though-list/58029812#58029812","title":"getting null values while iterating though list"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12094308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd42ae219a3ccec5aaa58dc376149c2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashu_Rjt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12094308/ashu-rjt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2148,"user_id":1466583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/g26DN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maximilian Ast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466583/maximilian-ast"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568988516,"creation_date":1568986085,"last_edit_date":1568986239,"question_id":58029337,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029337","body_markdown":"``` cs\r\nEntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_Consumer, Models.ConsumerBio&gt; entObject = new EntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_Consumer, Models.ConsumerBio&gt;();\r\nEntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_Address, Models.ConsumerAddress&gt; entObjectAdd = new EntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_Address, Models.ConsumerAddress&gt;();\r\nEntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_CardDetails, Models.ConsumerCardDetails&gt; entObjectcard = new EntityMapper&lt;Datahub.Test_CardDetails, Models.ConsumerCardDetails&gt;();\r\n\r\nList&lt;Models.ConsumerBio&gt; lstModConsumer = new List&lt;Models.ConsumerBio&gt;();           \r\nList&lt;Models.ConsumerAddress&gt; lstobjConAdd = new List&lt;Models.ConsumerAddress&gt;();\r\nList&lt;Models.ConsumerCardDetails&gt; lstobjConcard = new List&lt;Models.ConsumerCardDetails&gt;();\r\n\r\nList&lt;Datahub.Test_Consumer&gt; lstDBConsumer = Datahub.DataLayer.GetAllConsumerList();\r\n//  Models.ConsumerFamilyMember objConFMembers = new Models.ConsumerFamilyMember();           \r\n\r\nforeach (var item in lstDBConsumer)\r\n{\r\n\tforeach (var itemadd in item.Test_Address)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tlstobjConAdd.Add(entObjectAdd.translate(itemadd));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tforeach (var itemcard in item.Test_CardDetails)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tlstobjConcard.Add(entObjectcard.translate(itemcard));                   \r\n\t}                \r\n\r\n\tlstModConsumer.Add(entObject.translate(item));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, in above lstDBConsumer object I am getting all db values , but while iterating and assigning values to  lstModConsumer , I am getting all null values except my DOB filed.

your django settings, you leave database host as EMPTY, then the default value would be `localhost`. When use `localhost`, mysql client driver will connect mysql server with `unix socket` not `tcp`.\r\n\r\nSo, for your case you need to export `unix socket` in your mysql container to volume, then your django app container utilize this volume to share the `unix socket`.\r\n\r\nNext is what you needed to do:\r\n\r\n1. Manual new a folder which later as volume to share your unix socket file \r\n\r\n    (IMPORTANT: you could not rely on docker-compose to new this folder, you will encountered permission error) \r\n\r\n        mkdir -p /tmp/slack_bot/mysqld &amp;&amp; chmod -R 777 /tmp/slack_bot/mysqld\r\n\r\n2.

using a wrapper to let me run Scikit-Learn&#39;s RandomizedSearchCV() over an LSTM model built in Keras as a means of tuning said model&#39;s hyperparameters.\r\n\r\nI defined a function create_model() to create this model in Keras, and then passed this function to the KerasClassifier before passing the Keras classifier to RandomizedSearchCV, as shown here:\r\n\r\n    model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model)\r\n    params = {&#39;activation&#39;:[&#39;relu&#39;], &#39;batch_size&#39;:[256], &#39;epochs&#39;:[200], &#39;learning_rate&#39;:[0.001]}\r\n    random_search = RandomizedSearchCV(model, param_distributions=params, cv=TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits = 3), scoring = &#39;accuracy&#39;)\r\n\r\nHaving specified metrics = [&#39;accuracy&#39;] when compiling the LSTM in create_model, not to mention setting scoring = &#39;accuracy&#39; in accordance with the RandomizedSearchCV documentation, I figured my model would be scored and tuned according the accuracy of my classifier. I was thus encouraged when RandomizedSearchCV began running and I saw that the &quot;acc&quot; of each epoch was generally around .63, sometimes reaching as high as .8- here is an example of the output:\r\n\r\n    Epoch 162/200\r\n    1861/1861 [==============================] - 1s 588us/step - loss: 0.6334 - acc: 0.6319\r\nHowever, when the random search concluded, I saw that my mean_test_score was .48 (and indeed the split_test_scores comprising this mean score averaged out to .48).\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand why this would be, as the &quot;acc&quot; seen in the sample output included above never went as low as this .48 number in any of its epochs. I&#39;m stumped as to what is going on- have I failed to set the scoring function correctly? Is something else being used as the scoring function (for instance, I saw that the &quot;loss&quot; in the random search output WOULD go as low and even lower than the .48 mean_test_score. But then again, I followed the documentation when setting accuracy as the scoring function. Does the .48 come from a validation set that is not the subject of any of RandomSearchCV()&#39;s output? Just what am I missing here?\r\n\r\nThanks so much!\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029313/why-is-the-mean-test-score-of-my-randomizedsearchcv-lower-than-the-accuracy","title":"Why is the &#39;mean_test_score&#39; of my RandomizedSearchCV() Lower than the Accuracy of all of my Individual Runs?"},{"tags":["nginx","url-rewriting","location"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":381,"user_id":5977709,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Wp5WfpAAGHo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAASc/-Lw55LJlMJ8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dusan Gligoric","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5977709/dusan-gligoric"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568990968,"creation_date":1568990968,"answer_id":58030688,"question_id":58029307,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030688","body_markdown":"you can do it like this:\r\n~~~\r\nserver {\r\n  listen 80;\r\n  server_name test.com;\r\n\r\n  location = /whois.php {\r\n    proxy_pass http://your_origin_host.com\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  location ~ \\/(.*) {\r\n    set $domain_query $1;\r\n    set $args &quot;d=${domain_query}&quot;;\r\n    rewrite ^ /whois.php last;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n~~~","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029307/nginx-location-domain-ltd-regex/58030688#58030688","title":"Nginx location domain.ltd regex"}],"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":1082554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/63f0f3d051bcc044ed549c73479dadf2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ekrem OĞUL","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1082554/ekrem-o%c4%9eul"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568990968,"creation_date":1568985979,"question_id":58029307,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029307","body_markdown":"i need rewrite for domain whois for example `http://domainname.ltd/example.com` must be call `http://domainname.ltd/whois.php?d=example.com`\r\n\r\ni try location examples but not working.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029307/nginx-location-domain-ltd-regex","title":"Nginx location domain.ltd regex"},{"tags":["ios","xcode","wifi","ios13","wificonfiguration"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12095692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MwIPTaFm2R4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdLBf6eiB5AzYuo9b_WlCRtfLrv1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Henry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095692/henry"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569142612,"post_id":58029300,"comment_id":102494086,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029300/ios-13-using-the-new-nehotspotconfiguration-initssidprefix-string-does-not-s#comment102494086_58029300"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12095692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MwIPTaFm2R4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdLBf6eiB5AzYuo9b_WlCRtfLrv1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Henry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095692/henry"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12095692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MwIPTaFm2R4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdLBf6eiB5AzYuo9b_WlCRtfLrv1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Henry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095692/henry"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569419196,"last_edit_date":1569419196,"creation_date":1569406997,"answer_id":58096248,"question_id":58029300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58096248","body_markdown":"Not setting `configuration.joinOnce = true` or setting it to `false` makes it work.\r\n\r\nA bug-report is already filed to Apple.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029300/ios-13-using-the-new-nehotspotconfiguration-initssidprefix-string-does-not-s/58096248#58096248","title":"iOS 13: Using the new NEHotspotConfiguration.init(ssidPrefix: String) does not seem to work"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12095692,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MwIPTaFm2R4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdLBf6eiB5AzYuo9b_WlCRtfLrv1g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Henry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095692/henry"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":104,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58096248,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569419196,"creation_date":1568985965,"question_id":58029300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029300","body_markdown":"I am currently running Xcode 11.0 and iOS 13.1 (beta).

I don&#39;t want to reinvent the wheel, so I was hoping I could inherit from Java Sun&#39;s implementation of PKIX.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can&#39;t find the source code. Apparently it&#39;s an engine class, and a validator is obtained with `getInstance(&quot;PKIX&quot;)`. The closes I came to find was `PKIXValidator` in `$JAVA_HOME\\lib\\src.zip\\java.base\\sun\\security\\validator\\PKIXValidator`.\r\n\r\nI feel this isn&#39;t the right file though, as the class itself has the following method:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nprivate X509Certificate[] doValidate(X509Certificate[] chain,\r\n            PKIXBuilderParameters params) throws CertificateException {\r\n\r\n            CertPathValidator validator = CertPathValidator.getInstance(&quot;PKIX&quot;);\r\n            CertPath path = factory.generateCertPath(Arrays.asList(chain));\r\n            certPathLength = chain.length;\r\n            PKIXCertPathValidatorResult result =\r\n                (PKIXCertPathValidatorResult)validator.validate(path, params);\r\n\r\n            return toArray(path, result.getTrustAnchor());\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs this class doesn&#39;t implement the `validate()` method, I assume there&#39;s another file which actually validates the certificate. And I don&#39;t mean only the signature, I mean KeyUsage, Extensions, correct Issuer/Subject, the whole package.\r\n\r\nSo, to sum up. I am looking for the implementations to check correct KeyUsage, Subject and Issuer, Critical Extensions, etc.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029284/where-can-i-find-the-source-code-of-javas-pkixvalidator-implementation","title":"Where can I find the source code of Java&#39;s PKIXValidator implementation?"},{"tags":["nlp","statistics","probability","ranking","question-answering"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":12012507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/37e6ae64825b77e646c0463355293251?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vineet Kulkarni","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12012507/vineet-kulkarni"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568988473,"post_id":58029282,"comment_id":102462380,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029282/how-to-combine-multiple-metrics-effectively-for-ranking-paragraphs#comment102462380_58029282"}],"owner":{"reputation":144,"user_id":10472356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a994bfde4f567bde91eb185175c38729?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arjun Sankarlal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10472356/arjun-sankarlal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":144,"user_id":10472356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a994bfde4f567bde91eb185175c38729?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Arjun Sankarlal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10472356/arjun-sankarlal"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568988554,"creation_date":1568985897,"last_edit_date":1568987715,"question_id":58029282,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029282","body_markdown":"I am trying to rank paragraphs based on a query, for which I use three different layers, of course TF-IDF is one among them.\r\n\r\nHere I have scores from three different layers for ranking the paragraphs, one is for document specific score, one is paragraph specific score, and the other is answer span specific score.\r\n\r\nThese metrics rank different answers at the top when used individually.

Is there any way I can do this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029259/limit-to-amount-of-data-passed-through-redirect-in-django","title":"Limit to amount of data passed through redirect in django?"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":193,"user_id":11990391,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47609bea87d0a81a577fc6cd6f937978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jihuuNI","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11990391/jihuuni"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568986027,"post_id":58029258,"comment_id":102460964,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029258/how-to-change-top-image-once-every-time-user-scrolls-back-to-the-top#comment102460964_58029258"},{"owner":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568986201,"post_id":58029258,"comment_id":102461042,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029258/how-to-change-top-image-once-every-time-user-scrolls-back-to-the-top#comment102461042_58029258"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12095632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3-jzkBNFPco/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdCqLjx4yoZRpx2hPXquVQ4KIX3jg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zhe tng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095632/zhe-tng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569069644,"post_id":58029258,"comment_id":102481322,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029258/how-to-change-top-image-once-every-time-user-scrolls-back-to-the-top#comment102481322_58029258"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12095632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3-jzkBNFPco/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdCqLjx4yoZRpx2hPXquVQ4KIX3jg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"zhe tng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095632/zhe-tng"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97949,"user_id":295783,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da548667c834109a7059b51060e53dff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mplungjan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/295783/mplungjan"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568986168,"creation_date":1568985828,"last_edit_date":1568986168,"question_id":58029258,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029258","body_markdown":"Im creating a website and one of the function is to change the display image in the section every time user scrolls back to that section\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried using the carousel method whereby image changes once when scroll value reaches (lets say) 100.

The goal is to determine how many different ways there are to assign tasks to students in a way, that all tasks can be accomplished and single student completes only 1 task. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ll appreciate any hints on how to approach this problem in a dynamic programming way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029253/dynamic-programming-algorithm-for-assigning-tasks","title":"Dynamic programming algorithm for assigning tasks"},{"tags":["django","search","filter","view","searchbar"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":258,"user_id":8895630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBdU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jordan M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895630/jordan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568991202,"post_id":58029251,"comment_id":102463845,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029250/how-to-implement-a-button-of-the-searchbar-erasing-the-query-django-environment/58029251#comment102463845_58029251"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":199,"user_id":7658051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hb7iZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tms91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7658051/tms91"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568985785,"creation_date":1568985785,"answer_id":58029251,"question_id":58029250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58029251","body_markdown":"I solved it by implementing a Javascript function erasing the text inside the searchbox as soon as the trash buttn is clicked, then the button executes the query (that has void argument).\r\n\r\nin *glossario.html*:\r\n\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- questo fa apparire il pulsantino di ricerca --&gt;\r\n    &lt;!-- questo fa apparire il pulsantino di ricerca --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;topnav&quot;&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;a id=&quot;pulsante_ricerca_avanzata&quot; href=&quot;#Ricerca_avanzata&quot;&gt;Ricerca avanzata&lt;/a&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;div id=&quot;blocco_ricerca_semplice&quot; class=&quot;search-container&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;form method=&quot;GET&quot; action=&quot;{% url &#39;glossario&#39; %}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;input id=&quot;testo_slot_ricerca_semplice&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; placeholder=&quot;Ricerca terminologia...&quot; name=&quot;q&quot; value=&quot;{{request.GET.q}}&quot;&gt;  &lt;!-- &#232; il nome che ho dato anche nella views.py --&gt;\r\n            &lt;!-- name dentro input text vuol dire il sintagma che viene dato all&#39;url di tutte le query, seguito da un = per indicarne il bersaglio&#39;  --&gt;\r\n            \r\n            &lt;button id=&quot;cancel_search_button&quot; onclick=&quot;Delete_simple_search()&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-trash&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n            \r\n            &lt;button id=&quot;search_button&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-search&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n          &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!--at the end of the page--&gt;\r\n    \r\n    {% load static %}\r\n    \r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src={% static &quot;js/Delete_simple_search.js&quot; %}&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nIn *delete_simple_search.js*, at path *static/js/delete_simple_search.js*:\r\n\r\n    function Delete_simple_search() {\r\n    \r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;testo_slot_ricerca_semplice&quot;).value=&quot;&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDoes anybody know if there is a more efficient way to erase the query?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029250/how-to-implement-a-button-of-the-searchbar-erasing-the-query-django-environment/58029251#58029251","title":"How to implement a button of the searchbar erasing the query?

observations:\r\n\r\n1.

At some point you have to flip the most significant bit that doesn&#39;t match\r\n\r\nThis gives us a handy greedy argument. We will always get the optimal solution by flipping the leftmost bit that needs to be flipped. At some point we have to flip that bit, and the order doesn&#39;t matter so we might as well do it first. \r\n\r\nImplementing this to be `O(N)` can be tricky - if we flip everything naively we end up with an `O(N)` flip which gives an `O(N^2)` solution. We can note that in determining the true value of the current bit, we only care about the number of flips that have already occurred. If this number is odd then the value of that bit is flipped. Otherwise it is unchanged.\r\n\r\nWe can then make a final observation to make life a lot easier:\r\n\r\n3. Flips cancel each other out. Instead of asking how many flips it takes to get from 0 to the target, let&#39;s ask how many flips it takes to get from the target to 0.

usually occurs when classes are dependency injecting each other, hence the circular reference. \r\n\r\nGiven you above example, your class `MatchService` injects `Collection` and `Calculator`. One of these (would assume calculator as collection is probably a doctrine class) dependency injects your `MatchService`.\r\n\r\nHere is how I imagine your classes are supt:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nclass MatchService \r\n{\r\n    public $users;\r\n    private $collection;\r\n    private $calculator;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(Collection $collection, Calculator $calculator) {\r\n        $this-&gt;collection = $collection;\r\n        $this-&gt;calculator = $calculator;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nclass Calculator\r\n{\r\n    private $matchService;\r\n    \r\n    public function __construct(MatchService $matchService)\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;matchService = $matchService;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou have a couple of options:\r\n\r\n - More services with fewer dependencies\r\n - Using statics\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s hard for us to solve for you as it&#39;s dependent on how you architect your application.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029229/circular-reference-detected-for-service/58029540#58029540","title":"Circular reference detected for service"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":523,"user_id":7588829,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1LgDJ7tn7E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN8/lBKB7lFMv-Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza Saadati","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7588829/reza-saadati"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568991068,"post_id":58030485,"comment_id":102463781,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029229/circular-reference-detected-for-service/58030485#comment102463781_58030485"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":37711,"user_id":1146363,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/071bc4c7c6229920fd24f2f37d42b382?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cerad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1146363/cerad"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568990274,"creation_date":1568990274,"answer_id":58030485,"question_id":58029229,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58030485","body_markdown":"As several people have pointed out, the circular dependency comes from that fact that you are trying to inject the Calculator into MatchService and at the same time, injecting MatchService into the Calculator.  No way to create one before creating the other.\r\n\r\nLooking a bit more deeply, it appears that Calculator is using the MatchService to get list of users.  As a second problem, Calculator is trying to get the users before MatchService has generated them.  \r\n\r\nHere is one possible refactoring:\r\n```\r\nclass Calculator\r\n{\r\n    private $matchDao;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(MatchDao $matchDao)\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;matchDao = $matchDao;\r\n    }\r\n    public function getHourlyRate($users) // Added argument\r\n    {\r\n        $query = $this-&gt;matchDao-&gt;getSingleColumn(&#39;Payment&#39;, &#39;hourly_rate&#39;, 32);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nclass MatchService\r\n{\r\n    private $collection;\r\n    private $calculator;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(Collection $collection, Calculator $calculator)\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;calculator = $calculator;\r\n        $this-&gt;collection = $collection;\r\n    }\r\n    public function getMatch($data)\r\n    {\r\n        $users = $this-&gt;collection-&gt;getAllUsers($data);\r\n        $this-&gt;calculator-&gt;getHourlyRate($users);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nRemoving MatchService from the Calculator&#39;s constructor solves the circular dependency problem.  Passing $users to getHourlyRate solves the problem of trying to get users before they are available.  \r\n\r\nThis is course is just one possible solution.  It&#39;s not clear from your posted code if Calculator really needs $users or not.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029229/circular-reference-detected-for-service/58030485#58030485","title":"Circular reference detected for service"}],"owner":{"reputation":523,"user_id":7588829,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1LgDJ7tn7E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN8/lBKB7lFMv-Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza Saadati","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7588829/reza-saadati"},"last_editor":{"reputation":523,"user_id":7588829,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I1LgDJ7tn7E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAN8/lBKB7lFMv-Y/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Reza Saadati","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7588829/reza-saadati"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58030485,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568990274,"creation_date":1568985708,"last_edit_date":1568986192,"question_id":58029229,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58029229","body_markdown":"I have a simple class which looks like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    namespace App\\Algorithm;\r\n    \r\n    use App\\Dao\\MatchDao;\r\n    use App\\Service\\MatchService;\r\n    \r\n    class Calculator {\r\n        private $users;\r\n        private $matchDao;\r\n    \r\n        function __construct(MatchService $matchService, MatchDao $matchDao) {\r\n            $this-&gt;users = $matchService-&gt;users;\r\n            $this-&gt;matchDao = $matchDao;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public function hourlyRate() {\r\n            $query = $this-&gt;matchDao-&gt;getSingleColumn(&#39;Payment&#39;, &#39;hourly_rate&#39;, 32);\r\n            var_dump($query);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut I get the following error message:\r\n&gt; Circular reference detected for service &quot;App\\Algorithm\\Calculator&quot;,\r\n&gt; path: &quot;App\\Algorithm\\Calculator -&gt; App\\Service\\MatchService -&gt;\r\n&gt; App\\Algorithm\\Calculator&quot;.\r\n\r\n**MatchService.php**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    namespace App\\Service;\r\n    \r\n    use App\\Algorithm\\Calculator;\r\n    use App\\Algorithm\\Collection;\r\n    \r\n    class MatchService {\r\n        public $users;\r\n        private $collection;\r\n        private $calculator;\r\n    \r\n        function __construct(Collection $collection, Calculator $calculator) {\r\n            $this-&gt;collection = $collection;\r\n            $this-&gt;calculator = $calculator;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public function getMatch($data) {\r\n            $this-&gt;users = $this-&gt;collection-&gt;getAllUsers($data);\r\n            $this-&gt;calculator-&gt;hourlyRate();\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe problem would be `MatchService` but what exactly am I doing wrong?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58029229/circular-reference-detected-for-service","title":"Circular reference detected for service"},{"tags":["jmeter"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1661,"user_id":9574885,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ebe96ed2a2b7fb08d1cd70a1e3a2108?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sunny_teo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9574885/sunny-teo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568988046,"creation_date":1568988046,"answer_id":58029867,"question_id":58029225,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58029867","body_markdown":"It seems there is a redirection happening and in your HTTP sampler and &quot;follow redirection&quot; option is checked.
