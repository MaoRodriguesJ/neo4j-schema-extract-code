is a **checked** error and actually it *should* be impossible to throw such errors, except of cases when it is a RuntimeException or an Error.\r\n\r\nBut actually it is possible. Here is an example.\r\n\r\nHere is a utility that throws **any** unchecked exception as checked:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\npackage org.mentallurg;\r\n\r\npublic class ExceptionUtil {\r\n\r\n\tprivate static class ThrowableWrapper extends Throwable {\r\n\r\n\t\tprivate Throwable throwable;\r\n\r\n\t\tpublic ThrowableWrapper(Throwable throwable) {\r\n\t\t\tsuper();\r\n\t\t\tthis.throwable = throwable;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t@SuppressWarnings(&quot;unchecked&quot;)\r\n\t\tpublic &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; T throwNested() throws T {\r\n\t\t\tthrow (T) throwable;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tprivate static &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; T throwThis(T throwable) throws T {\r\n\t\tthrow throwable;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic static &lt;T extends Throwable&gt; void throwUnchecked(T throwable) {\r\n\t\tnew ThrowableWrapper(throwable).throwNested();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of usage:\r\n\r\n```Java\r\npackage org.mentallurg;\r\n\r\npublic class Test {\r\n\r\n\tprivate static void doSomething() {\r\n\t\tException checkedException = new Exception(&quot;I am checked exception&quot;);\r\n\t\tExceptionUtil.throwUnchecked(checkedException);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\tdoSomething();\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nPay attention that there is no `throws Throwable` clause, neither in `main` not in `doSomething`. And there is no compile error. In case of `RuntimeException` it would be understandable, but not in case of `Throwable`.\r\n\r\nIf we execute it, we get following:\r\n```\r\nException in thread &quot;main&quot; java.lang.Exception: I am checked exception\r\n\tat org.mentallurg.Test.doSomething(Test.java:6)\r\n\tat org.mentallurg.Test.main(Test.java:11)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow it works?\r\n\r\nThe most important part is this one:\r\n```Java\r\nnew ThrowableWrapper(throwable).throwNested();\r\n```\r\n\r\nActually method `throwNested` here *can* throw a `Throwable`. That&#39;s why Java compiler *should* raise an error and *should* require that this line of code is either surrounded with try/catch or `Throwable` clause should be added. But it doesn&#39;t. Why? I believe this is a flaw in Java compiler. Some comments on SO in other threads refer to type erasure, but they are incorrect, because type erasure is relevant during the *run* time, where as we are talking about the *compile* time.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that the decompiled code shows that here a `Throwable` (not `RuntimeException`, not `Error`) will be thrown:\r\n```\r\n  public static &lt;T extends java.lang.Throwable&gt; void throwUnchecked(T);\r\n    Code:\r\n       0: new           #28                 // class org/mentallurg/ExceptionUtil$ThrowableWrapper\r\n       3: dup\r\n       4: aload_0\r\n       5: invokespecial #30                 // Method org/mentallurg/ExceptionUtil$ThrowableWrapper.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:(Ljava/lang/Throwable;)V\r\n       8: invokevirtual #32                 // Method org/mentallurg/ExceptionUtil$ThrowableWrapper.throwNested:()Ljava/lang/Throwable;\r\n      11: pop\r\n      12: return\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behaviour is not specific for `Throwable`. We can replace it with a checked `Exception` and will get the same result:\r\n```Java\r\npublic &lt;T extends Exception&gt; T throwNested() throws T {\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all such cases if we replace generics with particular classes, then Java compiler will report an error, which is correct.

The next release of the compiler might pack the data differently and break compatibility with all your data files.  And more than one big company has found out that they accidentally created two data formats, big-endian and little-endian, by compiling on another CPU and not normalizing.  Often, there wasn’t any easy way to tell which one an old file was saved in.  Remember, data outlives code!\r\n\r\nThis assumes that you want to use the `ip_header` structure within your program, it should be padded for efficient access, and that its purpose is not merely to shadow the file layout.\r\n\r\nWhen the fields have different sizes interspersed together, there’s not a good way around setting them individually.  You cannot assume that the implementation can use an arbitrary, unaligned address as a pointer.  In this case, I also didn’t assume that the file has the same endianness as your CPU; I defined the byte order as big-endian.

Most modern compilers are smart enough to combine consecutive `memcpy()` calls to consecutive locations, to compile unneeded byte-swaps to no-ops, and to only `memset()` bytes that won’t be overwritten immediately after, so, if you could get away with just copying the bytes, this way should be just as efficient.  (For your purposes, you could even skip zeroing-out the padding bytes and doing endian-conversion.)\r\n\r\nRemember, the read operation will take much, much longer than any of the bit-twiddling to deal with alignment endianness, or padding.  Trying to optimize those is not a good use of your time.  Especially if it compiles to an incompatible program on another compiler!\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.62/glib-Byte-Order-Macros.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998948/what-is-the-best-way-to-read-a-structure-from-a-binary-file-containing-ip-header/58002469#58002469","title":"What is the best way to read a structure from a binary file containing IP header fragments?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9943,"user_id":7582247,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-OH0qZNY40Y4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABbc/xAoU3i299E0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ted Lyngmo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7582247/ted-lyngmo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568913933,"creation_date":1568913933,"answer_id":58016160,"question_id":57998948,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58016160","body_markdown":"If your IPv4 headers are stored in the same format as &quot;they came in&quot; (which is the usual way to store them) - with source and destination address being the last fields in the header, this should do it:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;netinet/ip.h&gt; // a common place to find a &quot;iphdr&quot; definition\r\n\r\n// add a streaming operator for reading an iphdr\r\nstd::istream&amp; operator&gt;&gt;(std::istream&amp; is, iphdr&amp; ip) {\r\n    return is.read(reinterpret_cast&lt;char*&gt;(&amp;ip), sizeof(iphdr));\r\n}\r\n\r\n// add a streaming operator for writing an iphdr\r\nstd::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; os, const iphdr&amp; ip) {\r\n    return os.write(reinterpret_cast&lt;const char*&gt;(&amp;ip), sizeof(iphdr));\r\n}\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    std::ifstream ips(&quot;ipheaders&quot;);\r\n    if(ips) {\r\n        iphdr h;\r\n        while(ips &gt;&gt; h) {\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; h.version &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.ihl &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.tos &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.tot_len &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.id &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.frag_off &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.ttl &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.protocol &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.check &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.saddr &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n                      &lt;&lt; h.daddr &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe first 4 bits in the physical header is always `version` but as @Mirco showed, the endianness of the computer you compile the program for matters when you fiddle with bit fields.

To get the image with that rotation we will need the axis to be located in the head.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998937/in-gcp-face-detection-where-should-we-assume-to-be-the-axis-to-measure-the-roll","title":"In GCP face detection, where should we assume to be the axis to measure the roll angle?"},{"tags":["c++","class","object","reference"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9704219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f6bfa4b2e8698387a63b2fe7629435a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew Cina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9704219/andrew-cina"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18285,"user_id":7359094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxJgU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fran&#231;ois Andrieux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7359094/fran%c3%a7ois-andrieux"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568832336,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102403991,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102403991_57998934"},{"owner":{"reputation":18285,"user_id":7359094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxJgU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fran&#231;ois Andrieux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7359094/fran%c3%a7ois-andrieux"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568832461,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102404039,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102404039_57998934"},{"owner":{"reputation":18285,"user_id":7359094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxJgU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fran&#231;ois Andrieux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7359094/fran%c3%a7ois-andrieux"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568832615,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102404098,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102404098_57998934"},{"owner":{"reputation":1203,"user_id":5105949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbd9d7ecb21c40f7a4256317fd80cecc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"churill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5105949/churill"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568837418,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102406011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102406011_57998934"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9704219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f6bfa4b2e8698387a63b2fe7629435a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew Cina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9704219/andrew-cina"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":18285,"user_id":7359094,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HxJgU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fran&#231;ois Andrieux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7359094/fran%c3%a7ois-andrieux"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568838088,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102406259,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102406259_57998934"},{"owner":{"reputation":1203,"user_id":5105949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cbd9d7ecb21c40f7a4256317fd80cecc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"churill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5105949/churill"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568873372,"post_id":57998934,"comment_id":102414226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998934/c-how-do-i-pass-object-by-reference-to-access-its-methods#comment102414226_57998934"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9704219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f6bfa4b2e8698387a63b2fe7629435a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew Cina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9704219/andrew-cina"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":9704219,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f6bfa4b2e8698387a63b2fe7629435a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew Cina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9704219/andrew-cina"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568838382,"creation_date":1568831619,"last_edit_date":1568838382,"question_id":57998934,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57998934","body_markdown":"I&#39;m exercising with understanding classes better.

With this change, we’re limiting the pool of schema types that\r\n&gt; can potentially trigger review rich results in search. Specifically,\r\n&gt; we’ll only display reviews with those types (and their respective\r\n&gt; subtypes)...\r\n\r\nEarlier, `CreativeWork`, `Article`, `BlogPosting`, `Service` were all supported and there was no error message on the structured data testing tool.\r\n\r\nNow, any schema other than the list below will trigger a &#39;_______  is not a known valid target type for the itemReviewed property.&#39; error.\r\n\r\nThe valid types for the `itemReviewed` property are:\r\n\r\n - `Book`\r\n - `ListItem`\r\n - `Course`\r\n - `CreativeWorkSeason` \r\n - `CreativeWorkSeries` \r\n - `Episode` \r\n - `Event` \r\n - `Game`\r\n - `HowTo`\r\n - `LocalBusiness` \r\n - `MediaObject` \r\n - `Movie` \r\n - `MusicPlaylist` \r\n - `MusicRecording`\r\n - `Organization` \r\n - `Product` \r\n - `Recipe` \r\n - `SoftwareApplication`\r\n\r\n**Note :** There are other schema types that are valid and may not trigger an error message on the testing tool for aggregateRating or itemReviewed.

how do I correctly use jquerys nth-child to change the text of a specific link\r\n\r\n`nth-child` is not the best solution for this scenario.\r\n\r\nIf you know the specific item to change (and don&#39;t want to change any others), then target that item directly:\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;#athletic-group-dropdown ul:eq(1) li:eq(2) a&quot;)\r\n        .text(&quot;not peaches&quot;)\r\n

Here&#39;s the simple loop I use to get the DOMDocuments :\r\n\r\n```php\r\nforeach ($links as $link) {\r\n    $docImg = new DOMDocument();\r\n    $ok = $docImg-&gt;loadHTMLFile($link);\r\n\tif(!$ok) {\r\n\techo $link;\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998881/domdocument-loadhtmlfile-not-fully-working-in-loop","title":"DOMDocument-&gt;loadHTMLFile not fully working in loop"},{"tags":["sql"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24910,"user_id":6808583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10154261199276585/picture?type=large","display_name":"Zaynul Abadin Tuhin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6808583/zaynul-abadin-tuhin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568831465,"creation_date":1568831465,"answer_id":57998899,"question_id":57998876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57998899","body_markdown":"try like below\r\n\r\n    select distinct a.membid\r\n    from a\r\n     left join b on a.membid = b.membid\r\n    where b.membid is null","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998876/comparing-two-tables-and-removing-ones-that-match/57998899#57998899","title":"comparing two tables and removing ones that match"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568831486,"creation_date":1568831486,"answer_id":57998907,"question_id":57998876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57998907","body_markdown":"&gt; The MembID can be in both tables but I would like to remove the ones that are in both from the results.\r\n\r\nIf you want members in only one table, here is one method:\r\n\r\n    select memberid\r\n    from ((select memberid, 1 as in_a, 0 as in_b from a\r\n          ) union all\r\n          (select memberid, 0, 1 from b\r\n          )\r\n         ) ab\r\n    group by memberid\r\n    having max(in_a) + max(in_b) = 0;\r\n\r\nNote that this version allows duplicates within each table.\r\n\r\nIn databases that support set-based operators, you can also do:\r\n\r\n    (select memberid from a union\r\n     select memberid from b\r\n    ) except -- sometimes this is minus\r\n    (select memberid from a intersect\r\n     select memberid from b\r\n    );\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nYour description of the problem doesn&#39;t match your data.

I.e, I have an Api that is able to call the SSR app, get the full HTML and print it into a PDF.\r\n\r\n**Why Angular?**\r\n\r\nThe entire project is build on Angular and I need to be able to reuse the component that renders the PDF-look-alike HTML for direct editing within the HTML.\r\n\r\n**Now that you are up to speed, back to the problem at hand**\r\n\r\nThe HTML consists of multiple templates which height changes according to the data added. In order to push sections down (or up) to a corresponding page I need the height of each template (after data is added) to know if the content exceeds the page height.\r\n\r\nWhen navigating to the SSR app via a browser everything is rendered fine because I am able to make use of the DOM and query into each template to get the height of the element. But when accessing the app via an Api or Postman I get the HTML back but the logic that handles the section placements are broken because it doens&#39;t have the height - **SO** I need to get/calculate the height of each template **WITHOUT** the use of the DOM.\r\n\r\n**What I have found so far**\r\n\r\nI am pretty new at SSR but everything that manipulates the DOM or something that only a browser engine has doesn&#39;t seem to be a viable way - so `@ViewChild`, `ngAfterViewInit`, `setTimeout` and other DOM Api&#39;s or functionalities cannot be used in this case. I need to be able to prerender each template at the lifecycle step NgOnInit (at the latest).\r\n\r\nUsing libraries like **[Mustache][1]** or **[HandleBars][2]** renders the HTML fine from the data that I give it but I **ONLY** get the Html - no dimensions at all.\r\n\r\nI have also tried to use `createElement(&#39;div&#39;)` after Mustache or HandleBars creates the element and add it into the newly created `div`. This adds the element fine to the `div`&#39;s `childnodes` but it doesn&#39;t calculate the height.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am missing something using one of these libraries?\r\n\r\n**Is it even possible?**\r\n\r\nSo far I am getting the impression that it is not possible to get an element dimensions from code without entering the DOM?\r\n\r\n**Headless Chrome?**\r\n\r\nIs running a Headless Chrome the only way to create a sort-of virtual DOM that I can manipulate from code?\r\n\r\nSorry for all the text and minimal amount of code but this question is more on how my approach should be and if I am heading in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js/\r\n  [2]: https://handlebarsjs.com/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998862/how-to-get-element-height-without-dom","title":"How to get element height without DOM?"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","sparse-matrix","tensorflow2.0"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568832875,"post_id":57999172,"comment_id":102404201,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998859/efficient-boolean-masking-with-tensorflow-sparsetensors/57999172#comment102404201_57999172"},{"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":7519842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/819bfaa9b05c82b5fcff7f0f7d9423e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"porgull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7519842/porgull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568833056,"post_id":57999172,"comment_id":102404285,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998859/efficient-boolean-masking-with-tensorflow-sparsetensors/57999172#comment102404285_57999172"},{"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":7519842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/819bfaa9b05c82b5fcff7f0f7d9423e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"porgull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7519842/porgull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568833682,"post_id":57999172,"comment_id":102404571,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998859/efficient-boolean-masking-with-tensorflow-sparsetensors/57999172#comment102404571_57999172"},{"owner":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":38,"user_id":7519842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/819bfaa9b05c82b5fcff7f0f7d9423e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"porgull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7519842/porgull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568888078,"post_id":57999172,"comment_id":102421713,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998859/efficient-boolean-masking-with-tensorflow-sparsetensors/57999172#comment102421713_57999172"},{"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":7519842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/819bfaa9b05c82b5fcff7f0f7d9423e6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"porgull","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7519842/porgull"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568893829,"post_id":57999172,"comment_id":102424880,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998859/efficient-boolean-masking-with-tensorflow-sparsetensors/57999172#comment102424880_57999172"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36490,"user_id":1782792,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e8dde1ee800b9687983617bbea3cb9b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jdehesa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1782792/jdehesa"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568888043,"last_edit_date":1568888043,"creation_date":1568832732,"answer_id":57999172,"question_id":57998859,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999172","body_markdown":"You can do that like this:\r\n\r\n    import tensorflow as tf\r\n    \r\n    def boolean_mask_sparse_1d(sparse_tensor, mask, axis=0):  #

This would be easy to do with `tf.boolean_mask`, but there isn&#39;t an equivalent for `SparseTensor`s. Currently, something that is possible is for me to just go through all of the indices in `SparseTensor.indices` and filter out all of the ones that aren&#39;t a masked row, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmasked_indices = list(filter(lambda index: masked_rows[index[0]], indices))\r\n```\r\nwhere masked_rows is a 1D array of whether or not the row at that index is masked.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is really slow, since my SparseTensor is fairly large (it has 90k indices, but will be growing to be significantly larger). It takes quite a few seconds on a single data point, before I even apply `SparseTensor.mask` on the filtered indices. Another flaw of the approach is that it doesn&#39;t actually remove the rows, either (although, in my case, a row of all zeros is just as fine).\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to mask a SparseTensor by row, or is this the best approach?

Handling error from outside _exports.handler_.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve developed all my code, it&#39;s all working fine, however, I&#39;m struggling to handle errors. I&#39;m using _async/await_, no callback.\r\n\r\nBasically, my code looks like something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nexports.handler = async (event, context) =&gt; {\r\n  const sampleVar = await sampleFunction();\r\n\r\n  const response = {\r\n    statusCode: 200,\r\n    body: JSON.stringify(sampleVar),\r\n    isBase64Encoded: false\r\n  };\r\n  return response;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGreat, right? My problem is that all my &quot;real code&quot; is being developed outside the exports.handler in different functions, something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function sampleFunction() {\r\n  const test = 123;\r\n  return anotherFunction(test);\r\n}\r\n\r\nasync function anotherFunction() {\r\n  const test2 = &#39;blablabla&#39;;\r\n  return test2;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, let&#39;s suppose that an error happens on my sampleFunction and I need to throw the error right away. I could just go ```throw { statusCode: 400, etc, etc };```, however, if I throw the error, I get a &quot;*500 Internal Server Error*&quot; as my response, no matter what. I can only proper break my code if I handle the error from within my exports.handler function. In that case, I could go ```return { statusCode: 400, etc, etc };``` or ```context.fail()```, etc, and everything would be alright.\r\n\r\nMy question is: is there any way to &quot;break&quot; my code and send a proper response from outside my _exports.handler_? Or maybe externally call my _exports.handler_ to return a specific response?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998855/throwing-errors-response-outside-exports-handler","title":"Throwing errors/response outside exports.handler"},{"tags":["asp.net","iis","ip","hostname"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568831710,"post_id":57998854,"comment_id":102403731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998854/how-do-i-assign-a-hostname-to-my-ip-address-when-publishing-asp-net-app-to-rdp-s#comment102403731_57998854"},{"owner":{"reputation":673,"user_id":3437688,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd1ae144fcd4cee87689c0e64542dd00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Barrosy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3437688/barrosy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568831883,"post_id":57998854,"comment_id":102403810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998854/how-do-i-assign-a-hostname-to-my-ip-address-when-publishing-asp-net-app-to-rdp-s#comment102403810_57998854"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568832058,"post_id":57998854,"comment_id":102403886,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998854/how-do-i-assign-a-hostname-to-my-ip-address-when-publishing-asp-net-app-to-rdp-s#comment102403886_57998854"},{"owner":{"reputation":45122,"user_id":11182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/842cd81474e74828f6afc3760766c7a4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Lex Li","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11182/lex-li"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568832614,"post_id":57998854,"comment_id":102404096,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998854/how-do-i-assign-a-hostname-to-my-ip-address-when-publishing-asp-net-app-to-rdp-s#comment102404096_57998854"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568832526,"creation_date":1568832526,"answer_id":57999123,"question_id":57998854,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999123","body_markdown":"This part of the operation of the internet, is a DNS Servers job.

When you click on that it takes you to a page that has their stats (the page itself is created essentially every time that you click on it with the basic html being the same but the data being filled in with the response from json ). my question is : is there a way to create a function in java script that will add an (&quot;about this person&quot;) place to the page if there is one for them...so essentially the individual pages for each member are created by java script after the json data is parsed so for instance ...... say i got the json response \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &quot;Response&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;results&quot;: [{\r\n            &quot;memberType&quot;: 1,\r\n            &quot;isOnline&quot;: false,\r\n            &quot;lastOnlineStatusChange&quot;: &quot;1550876089&quot;,\r\n            &quot;groupId&quot;: &quot;699392&quot;,\r\n            &quot;destinyUserInfo&quot;: {\r\n              &quot;LastSeenDisplayName&quot;: &quot;AMonkeyFlingnPoo&quot;,\r\n              &quot;LastSeenDisplayNameType&quot;: 2,\r\n              &quot;iconPath&quot;: &quot;/img/theme/destiny/icons/icon_psn.png&quot;,\r\n              &quot;crossSaveOverride&quot;: 0,\r\n              &quot;applicableMembershipTypes&quot;: [\r\n                2\r\n              ],\r\n              &quot;isPublic&quot;: false,\r\n              &quot;membershipType&quot;: 2,\r\n              &quot;membershipId&quot;: &quot;4611686018428817186&quot;,\r\n              &quot;displayName&quot;: &quot;AMonkeyFlingnPoo&quot;\r\n            },\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe javascript handles the data and creates a link on the page that takes us to : https://beatsbycayde.com/player/?bungieId=15951432&amp;destinyId=4611686018428817186&amp;joined=2018-12-28&amp;rank=1\r\n\r\nso would there be a way to (if i created the Html) and wrote something like: &quot;user&quot; is an integral part of our team and likes to focus on blah blah activities ect. &quot; saved it as an html file. \r\nwould their be a way to have java script search through a list of numbers and if their number was in that list then add a specific portion of html into the page based off their id number.

the last comments,&lt;/sup&gt; the **`numpy`**-based problem solution is doable:\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhile there may be smarter `numpy`-vectorised trics doable, the non-interfering adding of many 1D-&quot;diffusion&quot;-kernels over a **`.view`**-based strided-tricks data seems uncertain ATM not to introduce unwanted side-effects of skewed-superposition(s) of both original plus kernel-added values from re-propagation of superposed values instead of 1D-&quot;diffusion&quot;-kernel propagations of just the original tensor values ( before any kernel-added products get added as these may reach the same tensor-cell location )\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**- step 0:** create a constant, Q-learning gamma-based &quot;kernel&quot;-vector **`kernel`** and a zeroed-copy of the `ORIGINAL_TENSOR` in `RESULT_TENSOR`\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; N_STEPS  = 2\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; Q_FACTOR = 0.99\r\n

current-column-wise mapping, so as to minimise the overall RAM-footprint.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**- step 1:** for each tensor-column, use the `numpy` striding-tricks for forming a 2D-meta-view of each of the such tensor-column, that has depth equal to n-steps ( for reversed-propagated q-rewards ) - like was used in this `rolling_window()` example for 2D-matrix&lt;sub&gt; (needs adapting for

scalar - by each current column&#39;s 2D-meta-view matrix &quot;rows&#39;&quot;[-1] value and **`+=` store** such produced &quot;scaled&quot;-kernel into a separate, `RESULT_TENSOR` (or the above explained `[SPACE]`-domain motivated re-useable/re-erased interim column-adder ) accumulating additive results ( IMHO this cannot be in-place, as the kernel-&quot;back-propagated&quot; rewards must not &quot;increase&quot; the other (though additive in result) Q-rewards, not yet processed by the `kernel`, as the strided-tricks are just a view and storing in-place would interfere with the not yet processed sections of the `ORIGINAL_TENSOR`.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**- step 3:** you are done, use the `RESULT_TENSOR` accumulated result, as it now holds all the Q-learning n-steps deep propagations of all non-zero values summed up with any cross-interfering side-effects avoided.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998816/how-to-exponentially-decay-a-value-along-an-axis/58000959#58000959","title":"How to exponentially decay a value along an

When the task leaves I decrease it a unit.\r\n\r\nI write those values to a file. That means I have to consider race conditions when two tasks start at the same time under the same worker and the `task_prerrun` signals trigger simultaneously and the same file is accessed.\r\n\r\nHow would I approach that? **Can I have a `threading.Lock` object living on the global scope?** This lock has to work under a per-worker basis so I guess it would be OK to have it declared globally despite not being very good practice.\r\n\r\nI **don&#39;t** want to get the **total number of tasks being processed**, I want to get **the number of tasks being processed by that worker**.\r\n\r\n&gt; The reason why is to protect the instances from being removed when the\r\n&gt; autoscaling group minimum size changes in an AWS stack...

doesn&#39;t seem to be a direct way to do this as per the docs. There is a `completed` and `state` input though which we can use on the final `mat-step`.\r\n\r\nIf you see the code for the `stepper` on [GitHub][1], you can see the following condition\r\n```js\r\nif (step._showError &amp;&amp; step.hasError &amp;&amp; !isCurrentStep) {\r\n    return STEP_STATE.ERROR;\r\n} else if (step.completed &amp;&amp; !isCurrentStep) {\r\n    return STEP_STATE.DONE;\r\n} else if (step.completed &amp;&amp; isCurrentStep) {\r\n    return state;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that setting `completed` alone is not sufficient since the final step will still be the current step. But as we can see from the condition, all we need to do now is change `state` as well.\r\n\r\nIn your last `mat-step`, add `completed` and `state`\r\n```html\r\n&lt;mat-step [completed]=&quot;completed&quot; [state]=&quot;state&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;ng-template matStepLabel&gt;Done&lt;/ng-template&gt;\r\n        You are now done.\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-button matStepperPrevious&gt;Back&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;button mat-button (click)=&quot;done()&quot;&gt;Confirm&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/mat-step&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen control this in your component when the button is clicked.\r\n```js\r\ncompleted: boolean = false;\r\nstate: string;\r\n\r\ndone() {\r\n    this.completed = true;\r\n    this.state = &#39;done&#39;;\r\n    console.log(this.firstFormGroup.valid);\r\n    console.log(this.secondFormGroup.valid);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: You can use the validity of the forms to conditionally set these two variables or show an error message to prompt the user to complete the rest of the steppers.\r\n\r\nHere is a working example on [StackBlitz][2].\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/angular/components/blob/master/src/cdk/stepper/stepper.ts\r\n  [2]: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-mat-stepper-complete","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998794/how-to-show-that-the-last-mat-step-is-complete-in-mat-stepper/58001416#58001416","title":"How to show that the last mat-step is complete in mat-stepper?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":6637167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-KoFx52_1E6g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAGU/RDmZbf3wwoQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Andrew Medhurst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6637167/andrew-medhurst"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4016,"user_id":9739129,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1264b7591b5bd70e6284cc120b5c0d96?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nash11","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9739129/nash11"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58001416,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568873892,"creation_date":1568831044,"last_edit_date":1568845540,"question_id":57998794,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57998794","body_markdown":"Okay. I can&#39;t believe that I&#39;m posting a question for the first time over something that should be so simple to accomplish, but here we are.\r\n\r\nI would like for the final step in my mat-horizontal-stepper to display a checkmark icon and green background once a specific button is clicked, just like the icons for the steps prior to it. That button would be the &#39;Yes, confirm&#39; button in the following image.\r\n\r\n[![Confirmation page][1]][1]\r\n\r\nOnce clicked, I would like the blue icon with the number three to change into the checkmark icon that I previously described, indicating that all steps are now completed. Steps 1 &amp; 2 do it automatically because it seems as if the &#39;mat-step-icon-state-done&#39; class gets applied to them once a button marked as **&#39;matStepperNext&#39;** is pressed. Sadly, Step 3 does not have such a button, so it must be done manually.\r\n\r\nNow, I&#39;ve tried everything that would come up for a search regarding this. Many posts suggest using custom icons with states using [```&lt;ng-template&gt;&lt;/ng-template&gt;```](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48182215/css-for-completed-mat-step-in-mat-vertical-stepper), but that has not worked. Others have suggested marking the step with [```completed=true; editable=false;```](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-stepper-custom-icons?file=src%2Fapp%2Fapp.component.ts), but this only works when moving to the next step as well, which means it won&#39;t apply to the final step. My hypothesis is that there must be some way to add the &#39;mat-step-icon-state-done&#39; class to the mat-icon somehow, but I&#39;m not really sure how to go about doing that. Also, please feel free to point me in the correct direction if my hunch is completely off.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/dN3MH.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998794/how-to-show-that-the-last-mat-step-is-complete-in-mat-stepper","title":"How to show that the last mat-step is complete in mat-stepper?"},{"tags":["java","jax-rs","swagger","openapi","quarkus"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3198,"user_id":331747,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08d311db9b4893455102265ceed010b2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shadowman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/331747/shadowman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569507331,"post_id":58001132,"comment_id":102626506,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998793/openapi-swagger-ui-annotations-beanparam/58001132#comment102626506_58001132"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3937,"user_id":5043585,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec96387a1a8295b6fd6dffb68f80c352?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Guillaume Smet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5043585/guillaume-smet"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568843184,"creation_date":1568843184,"answer_id":58001132,"question_id":57998793,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58001132","body_markdown":"I know they improved all that in SmallRye OpenAPI 1.1.5 with this PR: https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-open-api/pull/138 .\r\n\r\nQuarkus 0.22.0 still uses 1.1.3.

My form object looks like this:\r\n\r\n    public class CommunityRequestForm extends AbstractRequestForm {\r\n    \r\n    \tprivate static final long serialVersionUID = 6007695645505404656L;\r\n    \r\n    \t@FormParam(&quot;description&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate String description = null;\r\n    \r\n    \t@FormParam(&quot;name&quot;)\r\n    \tprivate String name = null;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic String getDescription() {\r\n    \t\treturn description;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic String getName() {\r\n    \t\treturn name;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic void setDescription(String description) {\r\n    \t\tthis.description = description;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic void setName(String name) {\r\n    \t\tthis.name = name;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy `POST` method looks like this:\r\n\r\n    \t@Path(&quot;/&quot;)\r\n    \t@POST\r\n    \t@Consumes({ MediaType.APPLICATION_FORM_URLENCODED })\r\n    \t@Operation(summary = &quot;Create a community&quot;, description = &quot;Creates a new community within a security realm&quot;)\r\n    \t@APIResponses({\r\n    \t\t\t@APIResponse(responseCode = &quot;201&quot;, description = &quot;The community details&quot;, content = @Content(schema = @Schema(ref = &quot;community&quot;))),\r\n    \t\t\t@APIResponse(name = &quot;401&quot;, responseCode = &quot;401&quot;, description = &quot;Authentication required&quot;),\r\n    \t\t\t@APIResponse(name = &quot;403&quot;, responseCode = &quot;403&quot;, description = &quot;Permission denied - you do not have access to access this resource&quot;, content = @Content(schema = @Schema(ref = &quot;baseError&quot;))),\r\n    \t\t\t@APIResponse(name = &quot;404&quot;, responseCode = &quot;404&quot;, description = &quot;Resource not found&quot;, content = @Content(schema = @Schema(ref = &quot;baseError&quot;))),\r\n    \t\t\t@APIResponse(name = &quot;500&quot;, responseCode = &quot;500&quot;, description = &quot;Internal service error&quot;, content = @Content(schema = @Schema(ref = &quot;baseError&quot;))) })\r\n    \tpublic Response createCommunity(\r\n    \t\t\t@PathParam(&quot;securityRealm&quot;) @Parameter(name = &quot;securityRealm&quot;, description = &quot;The security realm name&quot;, required = true) String securityRealmName,\r\n    \t\t\t@BeanParam CommunityRequestForm communityForm) {\r\n      // Stuff\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far, so good.  However, I have not been able to figure out how to annotate the `name` and `description` parameters so they are documented by OpenAPI/Swagger-UI.  I tried changing the parameter annotations and definition to look like this:\r\n\r\n\t@FormParam(&quot;description&quot;)\r\n\t@Parameter(name = &quot;description&quot;, required = true, style = ParameterStyle.FORM)\r\n\tprivate String description = null;\r\n\r\nThat did nothing.  I tried changing my method signature to look like this:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n    public Response createCommunity(\r\n    \t\t\t@PathParam(&quot;securityRealm&quot;) @Parameter(name = &quot;securityRealm&quot;, description = &quot;The security realm name&quot;, required = true) String securityRealmName,\r\n    \t\t\t@Parameter(style = ParameterStyle.FORM) @BeanParam CommunityRequestForm communityForm)\r\n\r\nStill nothing.  My question is, is there a way to get the OpenAPI/Swagger-UI annotations to play nicely and document a `@BeanParam` annotated object?  Or is this approach not supported at all?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998793/openapi-swagger-ui-annotations-beanparam","title":"OpenAPI/Swagger-UI Annotations &amp;

this is homework, I will advise about the algorithm but not provide code (that would remove the point of the exercise).\r\n\r\nBlank lines at the beginning and at the end must be removed, but blank lines in the middle must be kept. You can only cache one line of input. Think about it: do you need to cache an empty line to print it? Or can you print such a line (or many such lines) without caching them? And what necessarily follows after a block of one or more blank lines?\r\n\r\nIf these hints are not enough for you, here&#39;s the algorithm:\r\n\r\n&gt;! Read from `cin` one line at a time. If it&#39;s not empty, print it. If it&#39;s empty, remember that you&#39;ve encountered one blank line. Keep reading, and as long as successive lines are blank, keep incrementing the blank line counter. Eventually, you will either hit a non-empty lone, or EOF. If EOF, simply end. If a non-empty line, output `counter` empty lines, and reset `counter`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding the other question: C++ abstracts files as *streams* of input (or output). A stream ends by reaching the EOF (end-of-file). `std::cin` is just one specific stream (subclassed from `std::istream`), as is `std::ifstream`. You also never know whether `std::cin` comes from the keyboard, or from a file (using e.g. shell redirection), and neither should you care. Simply write your code to the stream interface. Note that it *is* possible to send an EOF on interactive input too; in Linux for example, it&#39;s done by pressing &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt;+&lt;kbd&gt;D&lt;/kbd&gt;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998746/c-how-to-remove-blank-lines-at-the-end-of-input/57998868#57998868","title":"C++ how to remove blank lines at the end of input?"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":7667468,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/578230882361538/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7667468/brian"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":57998868,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568831709,"creation_date":1568830880,"question_id":57998746,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57998746","body_markdown":"I have a homework exercise where I need to create a filter that removes blank lines at the beginning and end of *cin*. Obviously the beginning is easy but I&#39;m stumped on the end. I wanted to use a dynamic array but that&#39;s not allowed... \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the exercise text: \r\n\r\n&gt; In this exercise develop a filter that removes empty lines existing at\r\n&gt; the beginning of cin and at the end of cin. A line is not empty if it\r\n&gt; contains at least one non-blank character. If an empty line contains\r\n&gt; blank characters then those characters can be ignored when writing\r\n&gt; that empty line to the standard output stream.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Caveats: we haven&#39;t covered arrays of undetermined sizes yet, so you\r\n&gt; can&#39;t store lines in an array, and you&#39;re not supposed to adopt the\r\n&gt; Perl approach, where you first read in the full file, and then process\r\n&gt; what you&#39;ve got. Using a std::string variable is OK, but that variable\r\n&gt; may never contain more than one line read from the standard input.\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no idea how you can know it&#39;s a blank line at the end without knowing what input is still to come. I&#39;d appreciate any help or tips pointing me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nI have a second, smaller, question. It&#39;s says file but does that mean it only need to work with an input file? As of now I can only make it work for either manual typing (ending input by some special combination of characters) or just scanning for a new line (which only works with files). Is there any way to end scanning the same way in both scenarios? (I&#39;m just using a while loop atm)\r\n\r\nAnd while we&#39;re at it, I&#39;m kind of confused by the wording. Are lines containing only blank characters supposed to be printed, or treated as a blank line and skipped? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!

think it depends on the library you&#39;re using for navigation, but, generally speaking, I agree with @Jin that using a `willBlur` event, or whatever your library&#39;s equivalent is, would be a better place for it.\r\n\r\nThe reason that I recommend this over `componentWillUnmount` is that some navigation libraries (such as react-navigation) will mount all components at once and keep them mounted until the app is closed, so even though you change screens, the component won&#39;t unmount and it wouldn&#39;t save your users data. There are options to change this functionality (e.g. setting `lazyLoad = false`), but it would probably be easier and more performant to leave the default settings and just use `willBlur` or the equivalent.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998722/is-componentwillunmount-good-place-to-automatically-save-user-input-when-user-mo/57999345#57999345","title":"Is componentWillUnmount good place to automatically save user input when user moves away from the current screen?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2672,"user_id":938363,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23d75d7db4d98e9004cc9988c4b3a67f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user938363","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/938363/user938363"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2672,"user_id":938363,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/23d75d7db4d98e9004cc9988c4b3a67f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user938363","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/938363/user938363"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57998927,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568834145,"creation_date":1568830790,"last_edit_date":1568834145,"question_id":57998722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57998722","body_markdown":"In my react native 0.59 app and react navigation 3.7, the `save` is triggered by clicking the `Save` button to execute the save():\r\n\r\n      save = async () =&gt; {\r\n       ....\r\n      }\r\n\r\nThen the app will save the user input data into the database.
