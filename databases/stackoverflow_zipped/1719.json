If more than one classpath entry contains a resource with the same path, then the resource belonging to entry that appears first on the classpath will be returned. From the [URLClassLoader documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URLClassLoader.html#%3Cinit%3E(java.net.URL%5B%5D,java.lang.ClassLoader)):\r\n\r\n&gt; The URLs will be searched in the order specified for classes and resources after first searching in the specified parent class loader.\r\n\r\nIn your case, `my-api` must be appearing first on the classpath, so whenever it contains a `config.properties` resource, that will be loaded in preference to the one contained in `my-project`.\r\n\r\nYou appear to want to load the `config.properties` that resides in the same classpath entry as a particular calling class. This _is_ possible, but it requires you to manually determine the root of the classpath entry the calling class is in. It involves quite a lot of code, and it&#39;s very difficult to cover all possible class-loading cases (i.e. class folders vs jars vs shaded jars built by downstream projects vs classes loaded over the network vs custom classloaders used downstream vs security managers, etc). So, I&#39;m not going to post details of how to do this here, as I think it&#39;s a bad idea. If you really want to go down this route, start by looking at:\r\n```\r\nFoo.class.getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, what are the alternatives?\r\n\r\nYou have several options, but my preference would simply be to put the various `config.properties` files in different packages. It&#39;s gnerally good practice to have a different base package for each project, so you could do something like this:\r\n```\r\nparent\r\n |\r\n + - - my-api\r\n |     |\r\n |      ` - - com.my.api\r\n |            |\r\n |             ` - config.properties\r\n |\r\n ` - - my-project\r\n       |\r\n        ` - - com.my.project\r\n              |\r\n               ` - config.properties\r\n```\r\nThen, you&#39;ve got 2 choices for how to load these files. If you have a class that you know is in the same package as each properties file, you can load it using that class:\r\n```\r\nvoid loadConfig(Class&lt;?&gt; sibling) {\r\n    InputStream config = sibling.getResourceAsStream(&quot;config.properties&quot;);\r\n    //...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAlternatively, you can simply pass in the package name:\r\n```\r\nvoid loadConfig(String packageName) {\r\n    String path = &quot;/&quot; + packageName.replace(&quot;.&quot;, &quot;/&quot;) + &quot;/config.properties&quot;;\r\n    InputStream config = this.getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(path);\r\n    //...\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you _really_ want to determine the package from the callee, you can use the first method along with an ugly hack:\r\n```\r\nvoid loadConfig() {\r\n    try {\r\n        StackTraceElement[] stackTrace = new Throwable().getStackTrace();\r\n        Class&lt;?&gt; sibling = Class.forName(stackTrace[1].getClassName());\r\n        InputStream config = sibling.getResourceAsStream(&quot;config.properties&quot;);\r\n        //...\r\n    } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {\r\n        // Calling class must have been loaded using a different ClassLoader.\r\n        // There&#39;s might be some complex code that could be used to recover here,\r\n        // but this should happen rarely, so maybe just propogate Exception\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don&#39;t recommend this last approach.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133494/classloader-resources-from-callee/58167346#58167346","title":"ClassLoader: Resources from Callee"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8693788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e65a324ff16da5bc4463ac2c99a4c514?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kenneth De Leon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8693788/kenneth-de-leon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":8693788,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e65a324ff16da5bc4463ac2c99a4c514?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kenneth De Leon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8693788/kenneth-de-leon"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569844222,"creation_date":1569583098,"last_edit_date":1569821580,"question_id":58133494,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58133494","body_markdown":"I have a project which contains two sub-projects.\r\n\r\n    parent\r\n     |\r\n     + - - my-api\r\n     |     |\r\n     |      ` - config.properties\r\n     |\r\n     ` - - my-project\r\n           |\r\n            ` - config.properties\r\n\r\nmy-api contains methods which loads resources using\r\n\r\n    ClassLoader loader = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\r\n    InputStream input = loader.getResourceAsStream(name);\r\n\r\nmy-project calls my-api&#39;s method to load config.properties stored in ````my-project/src/test/resources````\r\n\r\nWhen I delete ````my-api/src/test/resources/config.properties````, the config.properties from my-````project```` is loaded correctly.

I can read and understand enough code to change style things like colour, backgrounds, opacity, add images etc. I used a free to download website code package (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) which is available on codepen and it says it is responsive. If link changes, the template is called Sticky Slider Navigation by Ettrics. Let me know if I should post full code here:  \r\nhttps://codepen.io/ettrics/pen/WRbGRN\r\n\r\nThe text is on a grey background which is in turn on a white background.  \r\nI changed the text in the very first heading (where it says &quot;Sticky slider Nav&quot;) and discovered that if the first word (first line in mobile mode) exceeds 12 characters, the left most character will be cut off in mobile view, while the right-most letter moves outside the grey area, and into the white background area, causing the page to scroll right. There is no problem in the rotated mobile view or normal computer view.\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot to show you what it looks like. It is a simulation but I also tried it on a real phone and it looks the same more or less depending on your phone model.\r\n\r\n[![Screenshot][1]][1]\r\n\r\nI typed the numbers 1-9 followed by the letters A, B, and C (E to L is part of the second word, this is intentional). As you can see, the number 1 gets cut off on the left, while the letter C goes past the grey area into the white. On some devices, you have to physically scroll/swipe left to see the letter C. If I remove a few digits (but the total number of characters are still 11/12 or more) the first, left-most letter still gets cut off - the remaining letters and the white margin on the right just re-adjusts themselves so everything but the first letter shows.\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the heading that I used/tested. I removed the bottom part as it&#39;s just extra code you have to read, and currently my problem is with the top part only. I used a code validator and no errors were found:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;content-type&quot; content=&quot;text/html;

want to create a custom Merge layer using the `tf.keras` API. However, the new API hides the `keras.layers.merge._Merge` class that I want to inherit from.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this is to create a Layer that can perform a weighted sum/merge of the outputs of two different layers. Before, and in `keras` python API (not the one included in `tensorflow.keras`) I could inherit from `keras.layers.merge._Merge` class, which is now not accessible from `tensorflow.keras`.\r\n\r\nWhere before I could do this\r\n```python\r\nclass RandomWeightedAverage(keras.layers.merge._Merge):\r\n    def __init__(self, batch_size):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\r\n    def _merge_function(self, inputs):\r\n        alpha = K.random_uniform((self.batch_size, 1, 1, 1))\r\n        return (alpha * inputs[0]) + ((1 - alpha) * inputs[1])\r\n```\r\nNow I cannot use the same logic if using `tensorflow.keras`\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass RandomWeightedAverage(tf.keras.layers.merge._Merge):\r\n    def __init__(self, batch_size):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\r\n    def _merge_function(self, inputs):\r\n        alpha = K.random_uniform((self.batch_size, 1, 1, 1))\r\n        return (alpha * inputs[0]) + ((1 - alpha) * inputs[1])\r\n```\r\nProduces\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: module &#39;tensorflow.python.keras.api._v1.keras.layers&#39; has no attribute &#39;merge&#39;\r\n```\r\nI have also tried inheriting from `Layer` class instead\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass RandomWeightedAverage(tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer):\r\n    def __init__(self, batch_size):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\r\n    def call(self, inputs):\r\n        alpha = K.random_uniform((self.batch_size, 1, 1, 1))\r\n        return (alpha * inputs[0]) + ((1 - alpha) * inputs[1])\r\n```\r\nwhich gives me a layer with output shape equals to `multiple`, whereas I want the output shape to be well defined. I further attempted\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass RandomWeightedAverage(tensorflow.keras.layers.Layer):\r\n    def __init__(self, batch_size):\r\n        super().__init__()\r\n        self.batch_size = batch_size\r\n    def call(self, inputs):\r\n        alpha = K.random_uniform((self.batch_size, 1, 1, 1))\r\n        return (alpha * inputs[0]) + ((1 - alpha) * inputs[1])\r\n\r\n    def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):\r\n        return input_shape[0]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this did not solve the `multiple` ambiguity as output shape.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133430/how-to-substitute-keras-layers-merge-merge-in-tensorflow-keras","title":"How to substitute `keras.layers.merge._Merge` in `tensorflow.keras`"},{"tags":["c#","linq"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":80061,"user_id":1663001,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/NBllQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DavidG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663001/davidg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569582961,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102653664,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102653664_58133422"},{"owner":{"reputation":4413,"user_id":3346583,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a1c10fae65fb338a8d62f4ba464a6db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Christopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3346583/christopher"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569583031,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102653700,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102653700_58133422"},{"owner":{"reputation":116265,"user_id":266143,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/487f6927f37c3005e5b918d131892715?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CodeCaster","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/266143/codecaster"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569583063,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102653717,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102653717_58133422"},{"owner":{"reputation":976,"user_id":9260725,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a4cb81681d77163e3422870b23ddbafc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"xdtTransform","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9260725/xdttransform"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569583185,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102653775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102653775_58133422"},{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569587878,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102656171,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102656171_58133422"},{"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7702511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc38dd847c8049988e824c1520938a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rafal010101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7702511/rafal010101"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569590318,"post_id":58133422,"comment_id":102657454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133422/how-to-select-listlistobject-from-listlistobject-by-object-property#comment102657454_58133422"}],"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":7702511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc38dd847c8049988e824c1520938a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rafal010101","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7702511/rafal010101"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4539,"user_id":4370109,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UcQgO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Brian Tompsett - 汤莱恩","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4370109/brian-tompsett-%e6%b1%a4%e8%8e%b1%e6%81%a9"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":7,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":-6,"last_activity_date":1569797135,"creation_date":1569582800,"last_edit_date":1569762461,"question_id":58133422,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58133422","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for solution of that problem: I have `List&lt;List&lt;object&gt;&gt;` and I want get new `List&lt;List&lt;object&gt;&gt;` by object property. \r\nLet&#39;s take this object:\r\n\r\n\r\n      public class DataModel\r\n        {\r\n                public int Id { get;

Lets define two parameters: `n` - the number of pixels in the image and `r` the window size of the Gaussian blur filter.\r\n\r\nYou use a very big kernel - 221x221 pixels so `r` is equal to 221. That requires 221^2 = 48841 operations per pixel using standard convolution approach. That will result in computational complexity of O(`r^2*n`). However you can use Central Limit Theorem and approximate the kernel used in blurring with a series of box filters separately in two directions. You can achieve even faster processing time if you use the fact that neighborhood of two consecutive pixels differs in only one pixel. Finally you can get computational complexity that is independent of the window size: O(`n`). See this [link][1] that explain the whole process. It is written in Javascript but the math is simple and well explained so you can definitely implement it using Python.\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://blog.ivank.net/fastest-gaussian-blur.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133383/efficient-blurring-of-image-using-a-mask-in-python/58133757#58133757","title":"Efficient blurring of image using a mask in python"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7972,"user_id":11162165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5kgh.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"nathancy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11162165/nathancy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7972,"user_id":11162165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5kgh.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"nathancy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11162165/nathancy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569639830,"last_edit_date":1569639830,"creation_date":1569639071,"answer_id":58142990,"question_id":58133383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58142990","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a method using Numpy slicing\r\n\r\n* Convert mask to grayscale and find contours on the mask\r\n* Iterate through contours and extract ROI\r\n* Blur each ROI and replace in original image\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nInput and mask image\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/fDRF3.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/USKDm.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nGrab ROI using Numpy slicing (left), blur ROI (right)\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WU7cE.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/iPWCf.png&quot; width=&quot;100&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nReplace blurred ROI back into original image\r\n\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvwsr.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\nThis method should be faster since you&#39;re taking advantage of Numpy slicing\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport cv2\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\ndef soft_blur_with_mask(image: np.ndarray, mask: np.ndarray) -&gt; np.ndarray:\r\n    mask = cv2.cvtColor(mask, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)\r\n    cnts = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)\r\n    cnts = cnts[0] if len(cnts) == 2 else cnts[1]\r\n    for c in cnts:\r\n        x,y,w,h = cv2.boundingRect(c)\r\n        ROI = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]\r\n        image[y:y+h, x:x+w] = cv2.GaussianBlur(ROI, (41,41), 0)\r\n    return image\r\n\r\nif __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n    image = cv2.imread(&#39;1.png&#39;)\r\n    mask = cv2.imread(&#39;mask.png&#39;)\r\n\r\n    result = soft_blur_with_mask(image, mask)\r\n\r\n    cv2.imshow(&#39;result&#39;, result)\r\n    cv2.waitKey()\r\n```\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fDRF3.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/USKDm.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WU7cE.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/iPWCf.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yvwsr.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133383/efficient-blurring-of-image-using-a-mask-in-python/58142990#58142990","title":"Efficient blurring of image using a mask in python"}],"owner":{"reputation":735,"user_id":972014,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c636e5bf05e33414753115bb1d655c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user972014","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/972014/user972014"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7972,"user_id":11162165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/t5kgh.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"nathancy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11162165/nathancy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58133757,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569639830,"creation_date":1569582636,"last_edit_date":1569639087,"question_id":58133383,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58133383","body_markdown":"I need to blur specific areas of an image.

This can take up to 1-2 seconds today, because the image is big (~5-10 Megapixels)\r\n    blurred_image = cv2.GaussianBlur(image, (221, 221), sigmaX=20, sigmaY=20)\r\n    image_height, image_width = image.shape[:2]\r\n    mask = cv2.resize(mask.astype(np.uint8), (image_width, image_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_NEAREST)\r\n    # Blurring the mask itself to get a softer mask with no firm edges\r\n    mask = cv2.GaussianBlur(mask.astype(np.float32), (11, 11), 10, 10)[:, :, None]\r\n    mask = mask/255.0\r\n\r\n    # Take the blurred image where the mask it positive, and the original image where the image is original\r\n    return (mask * blurred_image + (1.0 - mask) * image).clip(0, 255.0).astype(np.uint8)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133383/efficient-blurring-of-image-using-a-mask-in-python","title":"Efficient blurring of image using a mask in python"},{"tags":["android","gradle","android-gradle-plugin","androidx"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":121618,"user_id":2016562,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2433495de6d2b99746f8e25344209fa7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gabriele Mariotti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2016562/gabriele-mariotti"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569585106,"post_id":58133380,"comment_id":102654749,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133380/migration-to-androidx-exception#comment102654749_58133380"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":277,"user_id":2800835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9eb1f02f288589c58c53cb20992ef5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxxxo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2800835/maxxxo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569583402,"post_id":58133516,"comment_id":102653892,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133380/migration-to-androidx-exception/58133516#comment102653892_58133516"},{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":10727746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KX5_kTrwhls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADDM/P86yNq1HPjE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stephan J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10727746/stephan-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":277,"user_id":2800835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9eb1f02f288589c58c53cb20992ef5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxxxo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2800835/maxxxo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569583571,"post_id":58133516,"comment_id":102653996,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133380/migration-to-androidx-exception/58133516#comment102653996_58133516"},{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":10727746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KX5_kTrwhls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADDM/P86yNq1HPjE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stephan J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10727746/stephan-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":277,"user_id":2800835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9eb1f02f288589c58c53cb20992ef5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxxxo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2800835/maxxxo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569583987,"post_id":58133516,"comment_id":102654226,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133380/migration-to-androidx-exception/58133516#comment102654226_58133516"},{"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":10727746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KX5_kTrwhls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADDM/P86yNq1HPjE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stephan J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10727746/stephan-j"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":277,"user_id":2800835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":26,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9eb1f02f288589c58c53cb20992ef5c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"maxxxo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2800835/maxxxo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569584146,"post_id":58133516,"comment_id":102654303,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133380/migration-to-androidx-exception/58133516#comment102654303_58133516"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":76,"user_id":10727746,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-KX5_kTrwhls/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAADDM/P86yNq1HPjE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Stephan J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10727746/stephan-j"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569583179,"creation_date":1569583179,"answer_id":58133516,"question_id":58133380,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58133516","body_markdown":"Maybe your gradle-wrapper properties are too old.

I need openGL for my program and at the very begining of problem I downloaded GLFW 64bit from [this][1] link and unzip folder. Also downloaded new Windows terminal and Ubuntu to use g++ command on it. But I don&#39;t really know where this command looks for basic libraries such as iostream so I simply took files in include folder in my project files and included them using **#include &quot;./Lib/GLFW/glfw3.h&quot;** and when I compiled it with g++ it didn&#39;t give me any error such as &quot;couldn&#39;t find library/folder&quot; but once I implement\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    /* Initialize the library */\r\n    if(!glfwInit())\r\n        return -1;\r\n\r\n\r\nthese lines, and g++ main, here what I took as

tried to take glfw3.dll into same folder but it always gives this message and &quot;ccP7KPvj&quot; parts always changes probably that is because code for temporary file.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to fix this and need help tho. :( Would be appreciate if I can solve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

My question is about nodes each having multiple attributes, but a different set of attributes, and selecting nodes based on those attributes hierarchically.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, I want to select a particular node of a particular type based on its type and name attributes, but some types don&#39;t have the name attribute.\r\n\r\nSo, for the following network\r\n    import networkx as nx\r\n\r\n    G = nx.Graph()\r\n    for i in range(0, 4):\r\n        G.add_node(i)\r\n\r\n    attrs = {0:{&#39;type&#39;:&#39;A&#39;, &#39;name&#39;:&#39;Amy&#39;}, 1:{&#39;type&#39;:&#39;A&#39;, &#39;name&#39;:&#39;Bob&#39;}, 2:{&#39;type&#39;:&#39;B&#39;}, 3:{&#39;type&#39;:&#39;B&#39;}, 4:{&#39;type&#39;:&#39;C&#39;}}\r\n    nx.set_node_attributes(G, values=attrs)\r\n\r\n    print([node for node,attr in G.nodes(data=True) if ((attr[&#39;type&#39;]==&quot;A&quot;) &amp; (attr[&#39;name&#39;]==&#39;Amy&#39;))][0])\r\n\r\nWhat I expected was for it to print out the node index for the first node `0`, but instead I get `KeyError: &#39;name&#39;`.\r\n\r\nIn most of Python, logical conditions are processed from left to right, so that the second condition is only evaluated if the first condition evaluates to `True` (it works in Pandas), but that seems not to be the case here.\r\n\r\nFor example, it works if I first create a subgraph of my graph by type:\r\n\r\n    H = G.subgraph([node for node,attr in G.nodes(data=True) if attr[&#39;type&#39;]==&quot;A&quot;])\r\n    print([node for node,attr in H.nodes(data=True) if attr[&#39;name&#39;]==&#39;Amy&#39;][0])\r\n\r\nBecause all the nodes of type A have the name property, I no longer get the error when I search by name in graph `H`, but NetworkX must be evaluating both logical conditions when I try to do this in one step on graph `G`.\r\n\r\nSo accessing attributes of types and subtypes quickly becomes a huge pain and memory hog if I have to make a subgraph for every type and subtype of node in my graph.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to extract particular nodes (or groups of nodes) based on attributes that only some nodes have in a hierarchical fashion to avoid this problem?  I like using list comprehension, but obviously it may not work here, so I&#39;m certainly open to other ways around this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133296/networkx-accessing-nodes-with-multiple-node-attributes","title":"NetworkX accessing nodes with multiple node attributes"},{"tags":["node.js","firebase","vue.js","firebase-authentication"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12130095,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC9nX2e6wPiP7FuzJSDUkc7L5VotwO7ASO0FuUr=k-s128","display_name":"Allan Stewart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12130095/allan-stewart"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569586092,"post_id":58133294,"comment_id":102655257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133294/firebase-auth-persistence-error-when-used-with-email-link-validation#comment102655257_58133294"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12130095,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC9nX2e6wPiP7FuzJSDUkc7L5VotwO7ASO0FuUr=k-s128","display_name":"Allan Stewart","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12130095/allan-stewart"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569582285,"creation_date":1569582285,"question_id":58133294,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58133294","body_markdown":"I&#39;m building a vue/node/firebase app.  I&#39;m using email link sign-in as described here https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/email-link-auth and trying to set persistence to local as described here... https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/auth-state-persistence.

three tags, and get a list of resources back OK, but I don&#39;t want all the information, I want to filter the list so I can have only &quot;Names&quot; or only arns\r\nthe output of a single element

No test clause specified, no exclude, no include: Terser is applied, e.g. local variables of methods are replaced in my stuff and in 3rd party libs. This is actually odd as `test` default setting is `/\\.m?js(\\?.*)?$/` according to https://github.com/webpack-contrib/terser-webpack-plugin which is untrue for any *.ts file. thus my Typescript files should not be processed by Terser but are\r\n\r\n2.) `test: /\\.ts$/i` - no terser transformation in my files or third party libs\r\n\r\n3.) `include: /\\.ts$/i` - no terser transformation in my files or third party libs\r\n\r\n4.) `include: /entities/i` - no terser transformation in my files (couple are in a directory names entities) or third party libs\r\n\r\n5.) `exclude: /vue/i` - Terser is applied, e.g. local variables of methods are replaced in my stuff and in 3rd party libs\r\n\r\n6.) `exclude: &quot;C:\\Repositories\\m2\\node_modules\\vue\\dist\\vue.esm.js&quot;` - Terser is applied, e.g. local variables of methods are replaced in my stuff and in 3rd party libs\r\n\r\n7.)  `exclude: &quot;C:/Repositories/m2/node_modules/vue/dist/vue.esm.js&quot;` - Terser is applied, e.g. local variables of methods are replaced in my stuff and in 3rd party libs\r\n\r\n8.)  `exclude: path.join(__dirname, &#39;node_modules/vue/dist/vue.esm.js&#39;)` - Terser is applied, e.g. local variables of methods are replaced in my stuff and in 3rd party libs\r\n \r\nThat doesn&#39;t make any sense to me. Whatever I put in seems to fail, e.g. test and include never seem to be true and thus nothing is processed and exclude also never seems to be true and thus everything is processed.

will be hard to figure out the exact cause like this but I can suggest some troubleshooting mechanisms.\r\n\r\n 1. Your stack trace suggests you are using a Telerik gridview. Try commenting it out or replacing with a normal gridview and see if the exception still comes. That way at least you can be sure which element is the culprit. Once you confirm which element is causing the issue, try creating a custom control by inheriting from the same type. Then in all the methods add logs call the base method. This way you will not lose the functionality at the same time can confirm what&#39;s going wrong. \r\n\r\n 2. Check if your running into some kind of infinite loop. The call-stack suggests that when it is trying to render all your elements it is running out of memory. This can come if there is some kind of ItemSource involved which is way too huge or so cyclic dependent controls are used.

Memory leaks typically reveal in very specific scenarios, so you should profile each possible workflow to state that - and this is impractical/impossible for larger apps. So the best thing you can do is probably to interview the users about their usage patterns and try to reproduce the leak locally with a profiler attached.\r\n\r\nAlso, investigating the call stack for the `OutOfMemoryException` is not always useful, as *any* allocation could cause it if there is not enough memory (so Telerik are maybe not to blame, though you can check their feedback portal for public issues mentioning [memory][1] or [OutOfMemoryException][2].\r\n\r\nOtherwise, as [suggested][3] in the comments, most of the good profilers detect common memory leaks, and even common WPF memory leaks, but, again, you have to run the app *through the specific scenario* (e.g. open and close a specific window), take the snapshots, and investigate the profiler suggestions.\r\n\r\nLast, by default WPF app run as an x86 process, giving them practically maximum of ~2GB of memory. Of course, there are class of apps that just need more memory (e.g. working with huge text streams in memory), if this is your case, you can try switching the app to x64 process, which will allow much more (16TB? if I remember) memory. Just have in mind that this could increase your memory even more (as simple types now [use twice more memory][4]) and could potentially slow down your application. Running x64 apps with the debugger attached also have [some caveats][5].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://feedback.telerik.com/wpf/search?listMode=Search&amp;categoryId=602&amp;statusId=4&amp;searchTerm=memory\r\n  [2]: https://feedback.telerik.com/wpf/search?listMode=Search&amp;categoryId=602&amp;statusId=4&amp;searchTerm=OutOfMemoryException\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133254/outofmemoryexception-ideas-from-your-experience#comment102654087_58133254\r\n  [4]: https://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasics32bitAnd64bitConfusionAroundX86AndX64AndTheNETFrameworkAndCLR.aspx\r\n  [5]: https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2016/Dec/19/Visual-Studio-Debugging-and-64-Bit-NET-Applications","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58133254/what-sort-of-things-might-cause-a-outofmemoryexception/58181088#58181088","title":"What sort of things might cause a OutOfMemoryException?"}],"owner":{"reputation":162,"user_id":7845440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3515279bbb11a9310bf0a7cc6bb82f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vanghern","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7845440/vanghern"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569973088,"creation_date":1569582152,"last_edit_date":1569973060,"question_id":58133254,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58133254","body_markdown":"I&#39;m facing issue with outofmemoryexception, with error message caught by App_DispatcherUnhandledException (1 of some error messages): \r\n\r\n    Message: Zgłoszono wyjątek typu &#39;System.OutOfMemoryException&#39;.

How do I do that?\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like to use the second approach, so I can first make a database request, and then save the file with an id from database.
