So for example one rule is:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    pattern = [(&#39;PRP&#39;, &quot;i&#39;ll&quot;), (&#39;VB&#39;, (&#39;jump&#39;, &#39;play&#39;, &#39;bite&#39;, &#39;destroy&#39;))]\r\n\r\nIn this case when analyzing my input text this will only return results in a string that fit grammatically to this specific pattern so:\r\n\r\n    I&#39;ll jump\r\n    I&#39;ll play\r\n    I&#39;ll bite\r\n    I&#39;ll destroy\r\n\r\nMy question involves extracting the same meaning of the text when people use the same text but add a superlative or any type of word that doesn&#39;t change context, right now it only does **exact** matches, but wont catch phrases like the first string in this example:\r\n\r\n    I&#39;ll &#39;freaking&#39; jump \r\n    &#39;Dammit&#39; I&#39;ll play\r\n    I&#39;ll play &#39;dammit&#39;\r\n\r\nThe word doesn&#39;t have have to be specific its just making sure the program can still identify the same pattern with the addition of a non-contextual superlative or any other type of word with the same purpose.

I use a read only collection here and drop the `dataset`?

Now when the email is entered into the `textbox` is there a way I can pull these saved values from `SQL` and  have the `checkboxes` &quot;auto&quot; checked based on what is already in the table for the corresponding email?

This way the app effectively creates a view of the image with an animated blur.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Technical details &amp; code\r\n\r\nAll of these image processing steps are achieved with **RenderScript**.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m leaving out the code for step 1, blurring the picture, since this is irrelevant for the problem I&#39;m facing.\r\n\r\n### Step 2: removing the blur based on a mask\r\n\r\nI have a **custom kernel** which takes an **in Allocation** as argument and holds **2 global variables, which are Allocations** as well.\r\n\r\nThese 3 Allocations all get their data from bitmaps using **Allocation.copyFrom(bitmap)**.\r\n\r\n### Step 3: applying a final layer\r\n\r\n\r\nHere I have a **custom kernel** as well which takes an **in Allocation** as argument and holds **3 global variables**, of which 1 is and **Allocation** and 2 are **floats**.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow these kernels work is irrelevant to this question but just to be sure I included some simplified snippets below.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to note is that I am following all best practices to ensure performance is at its best regarding Allocations, RenderScript and my SurfaceView.\r\n\r\nSo common mistakes such as creating a new RenderScript instance each time, not re-using Allocations when possible,.. are safe to ignore.\r\n\r\n\r\n*blurMask.rs*\r\n```c\r\n#pragma version(1)\r\n#pragma rs java_package_name(com.example.rs)\r\n#pragma rs_fp_relaxed\r\n\r\n// Extra allocations\r\nrs_allocation allocBlur;\r\nrs_allocation allocBlurMask;\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * RenderScript kernel that performs a masked blur manipulation.\r\n * Blur Pseudo: out = original * blurMask + blur * (1.0 - blurMask)\r\n * -&gt; Execute this for all channels\r\n */\r\nuchar4 __attribute__((kernel)) blur_mask(uchar4 inOriginal, uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {\r\n    // Manually getting current element from the blur and mask allocations\r\n    uchar4 inBlur = rsGetElementAt_uchar4(allocBlur, x, y);\r\n    uchar4 inBlurMask = rsGetElementAt_uchar4(allocBlurMask, x, y);\r\n\r\n   // normalize to 0.0 -&gt; 1.0\r\n    float4 inOriginalNorm = rsUnpackColor8888(inOriginal);\r\n    float4 inBlurNorm = rsUnpackColor8888(inBlur);\r\n    float4 inBlurMaskNorm = rsUnpackColor8888(inBlurMask);\r\n\r\n    inBlurNorm.rgb = inBlurNorm.rgb * 0.7 + 0.3;\r\n\r\n    float4 outNorm = inOriginalNorm;\r\n    outNorm.rgb = inOriginalNorm.rgb * inBlurMaskNorm.rgb + inBlurNorm.rgb * (1.0 - inBlurMaskNorm.rgb);\r\n\r\n    return rsPackColorTo8888(outNorm);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n*myKernel.rs*\r\n```c\r\n#pragma version(1)\r\n#pragma rs java_package_name(com.example.rs)\r\n#pragma rs_fp_relaxed\r\n\r\n// Extra allocations\r\nrs_allocation allocExtra;\r\n\r\n// Randoms; Values are set from kotlin, the values below just act as a min placeholder.\r\nfloat randB = 0.1f;\r\nfloat randW = 0.75f;\r\n\r\n/*\r\n * RenderScript kernel that performs a manipulation.\r\n */\r\nuchar4 __attribute__((kernel)) my_kernel(uchar4 inOriginal, uint32_t x, uint32_t y) {\r\n    // Manually getting current element from the extra allocation\r\n    uchar4 inExtra = rsGetElementAt_uchar4(allocExtra, x, y);\r\n\r\n   // normalize to 0.0 -&gt; 1.0\r\n    float4 inOriginalNorm = rsUnpackColor8888(inOriginal);\r\n    float4 inExtraNorm = rsUnpackColor8888(inExtra);\r\n\r\n    float4 outNorm = inOriginalNorm;\r\n    if (inExtraNorm.r &gt; 0.0) {\r\n        outNorm.rgb = inOriginalNorm.rgb * 0.7 + 0.3;\r\n        // Separate channel operation since we are using inExtraNorm.r everywhere\r\n        outNorm.r = outNorm.r * inExtraNorm.r + inOriginalNorm.r * (1.0 - inExtraNorm.r);\r\n        outNorm.g = outNorm.g * inExtraNorm.r + inOriginalNorm.g * (1.0 - inExtraNorm.r);\r\n        outNorm.b = outNorm.b * inExtraNorm.r + inOriginalNorm.b * (1.0 - inExtraNorm.r);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (inExtraNorm.g &gt; 0.0) {\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return rsPackColorTo8888(outNorm);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Problem\r\n\r\nSo the app works great on a range of devices, even on low-end devices. I manually cap the FPS at 15, but when I remove this cap, I get results ranging from 15-20 on low-end devices to 35-40 on high-end devices.\r\n\r\nThe **Samsung Galaxy S8** is where my problem occurs. For some reason I only manage to get around 10 FPS. If I use **adb** to force RenderScript to use CPU instead:\r\n```cli\r\nadb shell setprop debug.rs.default-CPU-driver 1\r\n```\r\nI get around 12-15 FPS, but obviously I want it to run on the GPU.\r\n\r\n### An important, weird thing I noticed\r\n\r\nIf I trigger a touch event, no matter where (even out of the app), the performance dramatically increases to around 35-40 FPS. If I lift my finger from the screen again, FPS drops back to 10 FPS.\r\n\r\n**NOTE: drawing the result on the SurfaceView can be excluded as an impacting factor since the results are the same with just the computation in RenderScript without drawing the actual result.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n\r\nSo I have more than one question really:\r\n\r\n - What could be the reason behind the low performance?\r\n - Why would a touch event improve this performance so dramatically?\r\n - How could I solve or work around this issue?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204613/renderscript-low-performance-on-samsung-galaxy-s8","title":"RenderScript low performance on Samsung Galaxy S8"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3244,"user_id":10824407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32862a03314e434224acf280c38e6e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Olvin Roght","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10824407/olvin-roght"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570030011,"post_id":58204612,"comment_id":102787450,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204612/reaction-time-game-in-python#comment102787450_58204612"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154611,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa274bbd8b70ad9c715bec8220c9858?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12154611","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154611/user12154611"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154611,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5fa274bbd8b70ad9c715bec8220c9858?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12154611","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154611/user12154611"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570030176,"creation_date":1570029938,"last_edit_date":1570030176,"question_id":58204612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204612","body_markdown":"I am new to the time import, and am trying to implement a piece of code into my game that requires the player to type &quot;jump&quot; within 2 seconds, or they fall their death.

I tried this with a simple logging, but it did not break there, and I think that would be a regression of the library if I needed to do this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204609/noclassdeffounderror-when-i-call-resttemplate-exchange-on-a-fake-api","title":"NoClassDefFoundError when I call RestTemplate.exchange() on a fake api"},{"tags":["vue.js","webpack","vue-cli"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4043,"user_id":834114,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a9420b4b37c4cc95ee09dcfcd6d1a9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"madflow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/834114/madflow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570033219,"post_id":58204607,"comment_id":102789073,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204607/syntaxerror-unexpected-token-executing-vue-init-webpack-simple-yourmusic#comment102789073_58204607"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9772145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208913710638882/picture?type=large","display_name":"Diego Alejandro Uribe Blatnik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9772145/diego-alejandro-uribe-blatnik"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570029929,"creation_date":1570029929,"question_id":58204607,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204607","body_markdown":"I&#180;d like to create a project with webpack, \r\n\r\n    \\npm\\node_modules\\vue-cli\\bin\\vue-init:35\r\n     program.on(&#39;--help&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n                      ^\r\n\r\n\r\n    SyntaxError: Unexpected token )\r\n    at exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:73:16)\r\n    at Module._compile (module.js:443:25)\r\n    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:478:10)\r\n    at Module.load (module.js:355:32)\r\n    at Function.Module._load (module.js:310:12)\r\n    at Function.Module.runMain (module.js:501:10)\r\n    at startup (node.js:129:16)\r\n    at node.js:814:3\r\n\r\n\r\nvue cli was uninstalled and installed once again, it didn&#180;t work","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204607/syntaxerror-unexpected-token-executing-vue-init-webpack-simple-yourmusic","title":"SyntaxError: Unexpected token ) executing vue init webpack-simple yourmusic"},{"tags":["mysql","ssh","ssh-tunnel","datagrip"],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":3298556,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MhiCT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chor Hatara Hud&#39;u Keturi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3298556/chor-hatara-hudu-keturi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570029927,"creation_date":1570029927,"question_id":58204606,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204606","body_markdown":"I am attempting to connect to a MySql DB with DataGrip, but it just endlessly fails due to timeouts. \r\n\r\nI have successfully connected near-instantly with both TablePlus and by manually sshing in and using mysql in the cli. \r\n\r\nThe access arrangement is between my laptop: computer A, a gateway machine: computer B, and the database machine: computer C, in the structure: \r\n\r\n```A--&gt;B--&gt;C```\r\n\r\nMy credentials are all present and correct and have been checked and reentered, and are as such: \r\n\r\n```\r\nGENERAL\r\nHost: localhost\r\nPort: 3306\r\nUser: &lt;username&gt;\r\nPassword: &lt;password&gt;\r\nSave: Forever\r\nDatabase: &lt;database name&gt;\r\n\r\nSSH/SSL\r\nProxy host: C&lt;.url.tld&gt;\r\nProxy port: 22\r\nProxy user: &lt;username&gt;\r\nLocal port: 3306\r\nAuth type: Key pair (OpenSSH or PuTTY) \r\nPrivate key file: &lt;path to ssh key&gt;\r\nPassphrase: &lt;password&gt;\r\nRemember: Forever\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, my ssh config: \r\n```\r\nHost *\r\n  AddKeysToAgent yes\r\n  UseKeychain yes\r\n  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa\r\n\r\nHost B&lt;.url.tld&gt;\r\n   ForwardAgent yes\r\n   User &lt;username&gt;\r\n\r\nHost *&lt;url.tld&gt; !B&lt;url.tld&gt;\r\n   ProxyJump B&lt;.url.tld&gt;\r\n   User &lt;username&gt;\r\n   ForwardAgent yes\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe logs simply record \r\n\r\n```com.intellij.execution.ExecutionException: SSH: Error connecting to remote host C&lt;.url.tld&gt;: Operation timed out (Connection timed out)```\r\n\r\nwith a nice lengthly Java stacktrace of the exact same error over and over again all the way down. \r\n\r\nI have tried varying the details in the setup many times and repeatedly got the same error - the only difference is if I deliberately enter my ssh key passphrase incorrectly, it requests it be reentered correctly. \r\n\r\nWhat is going on?

No matter how you have initialized them you are still going to have the following problems: \r\n\r\nFirst Opus encoding doesn&#39;t support arbitrary frame sizes but instead 2.5ms, 5ms, 10ms, 20, 40ms or 60ms [RFC 6716 - Definition of the Opus Audio Codec][1] relevant section 2.1.4. Moreover opus supports only 8kHz, 12kHz, 16kHz, 24kHz or 48kHz sample rates. No matter which of those you have chosen your array of 10 elements doesn&#39;t correspond to any of the supported frame sizes. \r\n\r\nSecondly Opus codec is a lossy audio codec. This means that after you encode any signal you will never (probably except some edge cases) be able to reconstruct the original signal after decoding the encoded opus frame. The best way to test if your encoder and decoder work is with a real audio sample. Opus encoding preserves the perceptual quality of the audio files. Therefore if you try to test it with arbitrary data you might not get the expected results back even if you implemented the encoding and decoding functions correctly. \r\n\r\nWhat you can easily do is to make a sine function of 2000Hz(there are multiple examples on the internet) for 20ms. This means 160 array elements at a sample rate of 8000Hz if you wish to use 8kHz. A sine wave of 2kHz is within the human hearing range so the encoder is going to preserve it. Then decode it back and see whether the elements of the input and output array are similar as we&#39;ve already established that it is unlikely that they are the same. \r\n\r\nI am not good in C++ so I can&#39;t help you with code examples but the problems above hold true no matter what language is used. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6716","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204592/opus-encode-decode-no-error-but-not-the-same-value/58327937#58327937","title":"Opus encode &amp; decode no error but not the same value"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":10054634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7wE83Ba4o5E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABM/ep5Um3v4_wE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Fantomiald","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10054634/fantomiald"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58327937,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570727366,"creation_date":1570029879,"question_id":58204592,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204592","body_markdown":"I have to use Opus Codec to encode &amp; decode audio datas in C++ and I have to encapsulate the functions.\r\nSo I try to send a floats array to try to encode it and I decode the result of the Opus encoding function.

Kind of like a todo list on steroids. At present it runs via a central golang server and users connect through local network to the server to retrieve data. The server gets the IP address of the host machine and saves it to a file on a shared drive and the clients read this file so they know where to connect. I would like to have this done differently so that the clients (also golang servers) each perform a search of the local network upon startup until they find the server and then store its IP address. I am wondering if there is a way to scan a network and ping each IP address until it gets a response from the server machine?\r\n\r\nI can get the client machines to perform a &#39;ping&#39; to a set address and I can expand upon this with a for loop to generate a list of IP address&#39;s to &#39;ping&#39;. It just doesn&#39;t seem elegant enough to me and I am wondering if there is a smart way of carrying out a search on the network pinging all machines on a set port until a response is received?

am using VBA to push calculations from Access into charts, graphs and tables in a template powerpoint presentation. The objects are manipulated with tables within Access for specific names, font size, chart type etc. The problem I am running into is moving my named objects within the powerpoint. Since I am using a powerpoint template I have specific slides that I need to move the objects to. Some of the slides have room for multiple shape/objects and are not necessarily in a specific slide order. The shapes are named within the presentation. I cannot find a command to move an object/shape to an identified location.     \r\n\r\nThe closest thing I have found is something similar to :\r\n\r\n        ActivePresentation.Slides(2).MoveTo to Pos:=1\r\n\r\nHowever, this moves the entire slide and not just the table, graph or chart. Again, since the slide order may change I need to use the name of the object and the name of the shape in the slide to connect the two. Any command I should research would be helpful! TIA!\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204545/vba-to-move-ppt-object-to-a-specific-location","title":"VBA to move ppt object to a specific location"},{"tags":["mongodb","mongodb-query","tuples","comparison"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1411,"user_id":10893484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Q0pcBHB1Hs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYEd63PWv3UxPIO0v_XW5OMv9KGkg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ashok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10893484/ashok"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570037778,"post_id":58204544,"comment_id":102791208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204544/mongodb-tuple-comparison-ordered#comment102791208_58204544"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1411,"user_id":10893484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Q0pcBHB1Hs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYEd63PWv3UxPIO0v_XW5OMv9KGkg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ashok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10893484/ashok"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1411,"user_id":10893484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Q0pcBHB1Hs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYEd63PWv3UxPIO0v_XW5OMv9KGkg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ashok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10893484/ashok"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570035509,"last_edit_date":1570035509,"creation_date":1570035177,"answer_id":58205972,"question_id":58204544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205972","body_markdown":"You can use below **mongoDB** query in respect of this **mysql** query\r\n```\r\nSELECT first, last \r\nFROM names\r\nWHERE (first, last) &gt;= (&#39;John&#39;, &#39;Smith&#39;) \r\nORDER BY first, last \r\nLIMIT 10\r\n```\r\nMongodb query\r\n```\r\ndb.Names.find(\r\n  { $expr: {\r\n      $or: [\r\n       { $gte: [{ $strLenCP: &quot;$first&quot; }, { $strLenCP: &quot;John&quot; }] },\r\n       { $gte: [{ $strLenCP: &quot;$last&quot; }, { $strLenCP: &quot;Smith&quot; }] }\r\n      ]\r\n  }}, \r\n  // project from mongodb result same as select in mysql \r\n  { first: 1, _id: 0, last: 1 })\r\n  // sort in mongodb\r\n .sort({ first: 1, last: 1 })\r\n  // with limit 10\r\n .limit(10);\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204544/mongodb-tuple-comparison-ordered/58205972#58205972","title":"mongodb tuple comparison (ordered)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1132,"user_id":4260959,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oOLOY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"auntyellow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4260959/auntyellow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1411,"user_id":10893484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Q0pcBHB1Hs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AKxrwcYEd63PWv3UxPIO0v_XW5OMv9KGkg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ashok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10893484/ashok"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570035509,"creation_date":1570029664,"last_edit_date":1570032989,"question_id":58204544,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204544","body_markdown":"Just similar to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57984354/mongodb-query-multiple-pairs-using-in\r\n\r\nI want to find first 10 full names with `(first, last) &gt;= (&#39;John&#39;, &#39;Smith&#39;)`.

What it will do is create a `std::tuple` that has single element which is a reference to `arguments`.  To get a tuple of references to a tuple need an adapter like\r\n\t\r\n\ttemplate&lt;typename...

I noticed the following lines of code in the method:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nprivate void InitializeComponent()\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager resources = new System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager(typeof(MyTestForm));\r\n    // ...\r\n    ((System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize)(this.rdp)).BeginInit();\r\n    // ...\r\n    // \r\n    // rdp\r\n    // \r\n    this.rdp.Enabled = true;\r\n    this.rdp.Location = new System.Drawing.Point(12, 12);\r\n    this.rdp.Name = &quot;rdp&quot;;\r\n    this.rdp.OcxState = ((System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.State)(resources.GetObject(&quot;rdp.OcxState&quot;)));\r\n    this.rdp.Size = new System.Drawing.Size(804, 602);\r\n    this.rdp.TabIndex = 0;\r\n    // ...\r\n    ((System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize)(this.rdp)).EndInit();\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, this is what I did foreach RDP in the loop of my question:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nforeach (RDPData rdp in root.Value)\r\n{\r\n    AxMsRdpClient9NotSafeForScripting rdpClient = new AxMsRdpClient9NotSafeForScripting();\r\n    ((System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize)(rdpClient)).BeginInit();\r\n    System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager resources = new System.ComponentModel.ComponentResourceManager(typeof(RDPMultiTabForm));\r\n    rdpClient.Enabled = true;\r\n    rdpClient.Name = rdp.Alias;\r\n    rdpClient.OcxState = ((System.Windows.Forms.AxHost.State)(resources.GetObject(&quot;rdpClient.OcxState&quot;)));\r\n    TabPage tab = new TabPage(rdp.Alias);\r\n    rdpClient.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;\r\n    tab.Controls.Add(rdpClient);\r\n    tab.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;\r\n    tabControl1.TabPages.Add(tab);\r\n    ((System.ComponentModel.ISupportInitialize)(rdpClient)).EndInit();\r\n    rdpClient.Server = rdp.Server;\r\n    rdpClient.UserName = rdp.User;\r\n    rdpClient.AdvancedSettings7.EnableCredSspSupport = true;\r\n    IMsTscNonScriptable secured = (IMsTscNonScriptable)rdpClient.GetOcx();\r\n    secured.ClearTextPassword = rdp.Password;\r\n    rdpClient.Connect();\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204531/how-to-show-axmsrdpclient9notsafeforscripting-object-programatically/58214013#58214013","title":"How to show AxMsRdpClient9NotSafeForScripting object programatically?"}],"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":2643554,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5b701849652e53b0f7a32bd06050bea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ArthurTheLearner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2643554/arthurthelearner"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570086606,"creation_date":1570029617,"question_id":58204531,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204531","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating a RDP multitab Forms application.

I want this object to be called hex(0,0,0) such that each zero is related to the three coordinates defined by the class. \r\nie;\r\n\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n\r\nclass hex{\r\n     int r_coordinate: \r\n     int g_coordinate;\r\n     int b_coordinate;\r\n     metadata\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nhex hex(-2,1,1)={\r\n     r_coordinate=-2;\r\n     g_coordinate= 1;\r\n     b_coordinate= 1;\r\n     metadata\r\n     ...\r\n}\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204525/creating-a-class-in-c-that-is-accessible-by-its-members","title":"Creating a class in c++ that is accessible by its members"},{"tags":["google-apps-script","google-sites"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":568,"user_id":11869748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qh4YQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZektorH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869748/zektorh"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570030367,"post_id":58204522,"comment_id":102787663,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204522/how-do-i-create-profile-pictures-on-website-from-google-sites#comment102787663_58204522"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12154607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c05dbc6478030b35d6577cf5cffddbc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julius Cool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154607/julius-cool"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":568,"user_id":11869748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qh4YQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZektorH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869748/zektorh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570130363,"post_id":58204522,"comment_id":102826217,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204522/how-do-i-create-profile-pictures-on-website-from-google-sites#comment102826217_58204522"},{"owner":{"reputation":568,"user_id":11869748,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qh4YQ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZektorH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869748/zektorh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570171569,"post_id":58204522,"comment_id":102836412,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204522/how-do-i-create-profile-pictures-on-website-from-google-sites#comment102836412_58204522"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12154607,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c05dbc6478030b35d6577cf5cffddbc1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Julius Cool","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154607/julius-cool"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570029565,"creation_date":1570029565,"question_id":58204522,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204522","body_markdown":"I want the students to create their own student profiles where they can say a bit about them and list the books they have read.

trying to print Simplified Chinese string using **Fujitsu FP-2100** thermal printer but the result doesn&#39;t match the original input. \r\n\r\nFujitsu iOS SDK(Obj-C) doesn&#39;t support Unicode and only supports **BIG5** code and **GB** code encoding. No mention of specific variants.\r\n\r\nA method provided by the SDK requires the non-Latin string to be encoded and be passed to the thermal printer as ``UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;`` for printing.\r\n\r\nTo check if I&#39;ve encoded it correctly, the string was, first, converted to Data using Big5 encoding and later converted back to string. And it was printed on console correctly.\r\n\r\nHowever, I suppose something went wrong somewhere when I tried to convert it to ``UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;``.\r\n\r\nSDK method: ``printer.printText(bytetext: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;UInt8&gt;!&gt;, length: Int32)``\r\n\r\n**Example code provided by their support (untested by them):**\r\n```\r\nNSString *strText = @&quot;中国語...\\n&quot;;\r\n\r\nNSData *data = [strText dataUsingEncoding:CFStringConvertEncodingToNSString(kCFStringEncodingDOSChineseSimplif)allowLossyConversion:YES];\r\n\r\nint length = [data length];\r\nByte *byteData= (Byte*)malloc(length);\r\nmemcpy(byteData, [data bytes], length);\r\nnRtn = [mPrint PrintText:byteData length:length];\r\nfree(byteData);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Here&#39;s what I did:**\r\n\r\nEncoding reference: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44064027/3476380\r\n```\r\nlet cfEnc = CFStringEncodings.big5\r\nlet nsEnc = CFStringConvertEncodingToNSStringEncoding(CFStringEncoding(cfEnc.rawValue))\r\nlet big5encoding = String.Encoding(rawValue: nsEnc)\r\n```\r\n**1.

Whether the error message is displayed depends on the amount of data that would be returned by the query. The error only occurs when I execute the query from asp and not when executed from phpMyAdmin.\r\n\r\nI can execute this without an error:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM `customers` LIMIT 500\r\n\r\nHowever, this next query results in &quot;An error occurred on the server when processing the URL. Please contact the system administrator. If you are the system administrator please click here to find out more about this error.&quot;\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM `customers` \r\n\r\nThe above query would return ~3200 records each of which contain 27 fields.\r\n\r\nThe &quot;here&quot; link in the above error message directs to &quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/application-frameworks/running-classic-asp-applications-on-iis-7-and-iis-8/classic-asp-not-installed-by-default-on-iis&quot; which implies that ASP is not installed. It is obviously installed because I can execute the previous query which includes a LIMIT on the results.\r\n\r\nIf I trial-and-error the LIMIT in the SQL query, I discover that I can execute this:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM `customers` LIMIT 702\r\n\r\nBut this next query results in the error: \r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM `customers` LIMIT 703\r\n\r\nThe LIMIT is related to the number of fields returned by the SQL query. For example, I can execute either of the following queries (they are almost identical, but one includes the City and one includes the Zipcode):\r\n\r\n    SELECT CustomerID, Name, Address1, Address2, City FROM `customers`\r\n    SELECT CustomerID, Name, Address1, Address2, State FROM `customers`\r\n\r\nBoth of the above queries return ~3100 records that contain 5 fields.\r\n\r\nHowever, I can&#39;t execute this next query which would return 6 fields for those same ~3100 records:\r\n\r\n    SELECT CustomerID, Name, Address1, Address2, City, State FROM `customers`\r\n\r\nIt **really** feels like there is a limit the the number of records multiplied by the number of fields. \r\n\r\nI am using a shared hosting service. I&#39;m wondering if there is a setting on their end that would cause this error. I didn&#39;t encounter this with my previous host. \r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204482/server-error-based-on-the-amount-of-data-returned-in-an-asp-classic-odbc-query","title":"Server error based on the amount of data returned in an ASP classic ODBC query"},{"tags":["ios","safari","gyroscope","360-virtual-reality"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12109003,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b24c63bea80971a7c70a177f30283d41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ronny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12109003/ronny"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12109003,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b24c63bea80971a7c70a177f30283d41?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ronny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12109003/ronny"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570029762,"creation_date":1570029441,"last_edit_date":1570029762,"question_id":58204481,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204481","body_markdown":"I use the program Garden Gnome (Pano2VR) to create 360 degree web applications.

am trying to write a Qt C++ code which should make a plot in separate windows by clicking Push Button.\r\n\r\nI  did by creating two forms 1: mainwindow , 2: dialog. Once I click on Pushbutton, immediately plot appears in different windows and next another window of dialog form is posed up covering my plot window.\r\n\r\nThe summary is that clicking on Pushbutton generates two windows which is not desirable.\r\n\r\nI did the followings:\r\n\r\n1. Created new project with Qt Widgets Applications which generates mainwindow.cpp and mainwindow.h files along with main.cpp file\r\n\r\n2. Created Push button on mainwindow.cpp file using form\r\n\r\n3. Created new dialog form using &quot;add new&quot; by right clicking on project\r\n\r\n4. Then written code to generate plot ( using Chart ) inside on_pushButton_clicked() in mainwindow.cpp file\r\n\r\n5. Then run the code . Eventually PushButton Window appears. Then I click on Push button, Then it generates two separate windows 1: Plot windows, 2: Blank dialog Window\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are total three *.cpp files , two *.h files\r\n\r\nHere is mainwindow.cpp code:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;mainwindow.h&quot;\r\n    #include &quot;ui_mainwindow.h&quot;\r\n    \r\n    #include&quot;dialog.h&quot;\r\n    \r\n    #include &lt;QtWidgets/QApplication&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;QtWidgets/QMainWindow&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;QtCharts/QChartView&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;QtCharts/QLineSeries&gt;\r\n    \r\n    QT_CHARTS_USE_NAMESPACE\r\n    \r\n    MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget *parent)\r\n        : QMainWindow(parent)\r\n        , ui(new Ui::MainWindow)\r\n    {\r\n        ui-&gt;setupUi(this);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    MainWindow::~MainWindow()\r\n    {\r\n        delete ui;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    void MainWindow::on_pushButton_clicked()\r\n    {\r\n        Dialog aa;\r\n        aa.setDisabled(false);\r\n    \r\n        //aa.display();\r\n        //![1]\r\n            QLineSeries *series = new QLineSeries();\r\n        //![1]\r\n    \r\n        //![2]\r\n            series-&gt;append(0, 6);\r\n            series-&gt;append(2, 4);\r\n            series-&gt;append(3, 8);\r\n            series-&gt;append(7, 4);\r\n            series-&gt;append(10, 5);\r\n            *series &lt;&lt;

looks to me your not really looking for a simple element delete but rather a more complex mutation the list can have. If you are, however, a simple call to `.delete()` is what you&#39;re looking for.\r\n\r\nOn more complex mutations, one good example case study is the `heapq` module from the standard lib. And they do it pretty poorly IMHO. Lets see.\r\n```python\r\nimport heapq\r\n\r\nq = [5, 6, 3]\r\n\r\nheapq.heapify(q)      # this mutates q\r\na = heapq.heappop(q)  # this aswell\r\n```\r\n\r\n_If you must know, the heap queue algorithm keeps the lowest item first in the list. So `q` is now `[5, 6]` and `a` is `3`._\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what you have, and it is in the standard lib. Whatever you make of that.\r\n\r\nHowever, I strongly disagree with this convention. All calls to  the `heapq` module functions will require passing that `q` as the first argument, and sometimes `q` is mutated . Yet `q` itself is never returned.\r\n\r\nThis is the exact problem a class solves. So why avoid a class?\r\n```python\r\nimport heapq\r\n\r\nclass HeapQ(list):\r\n    def __init__(self, a_list):\r\n        super().__init__(a_list)  # calling the base `list()`\r\n        heapq.heapify(self)\r\n\r\n    def pop(self):\r\n        return heapq.heappop(self)\r\n\r\n    def push(self, value):\r\n        heapq.heappush(self, value)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the calling convention is a bit more logical.\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; q = HeapQ([5, 6, 3])\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a = q.pop()\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; q\r\n[5, 6]\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a\r\n3\r\n```\r\nThis is way more pythonic, and with less surprises. Mutations on `q` are not surprising, every mutation is a call on `q`. `q.pop()`, `q.push(0)`, both mutate `q`.\r\n\r\n_I actually do a more elaborate version of this all the time I need the `heapq` module._","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204471/pythonic-way-to-write-a-function-which-modifies-a-list/58205048#58205048","title":"Pythonic way to write a function which modifies a list?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11778,"user_id":5349916,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QovYv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MisterMiyagi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5349916/mistermiyagi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11778,"user_id":5349916,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QovYv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MisterMiyagi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5349916/mistermiyagi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570041603,"last_edit_date":1570041603,"creation_date":1570033055,"answer_id":58205449,"question_id":58204471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58205449","body_markdown":"TLDR: If you modify an argument, do not return it.\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n&gt; `list.sort()` sorts the list in place. In order to remind you of that fact, it does not return the sorted list.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; [Design and History FAQ][1]\r\n\r\nIt is idiomatic to indicate whether you modify an argument by not returning it. For example, your first case is correct, your second is not:\r\n\r\n    def remove_one(b):\r\n        b.remove(1)  # modify, do not return\r\n\r\nIf you do not modify an argument but create a copy, you must ``return`` the copy for the operation to be meaningful:\r\n\r\n    def one_removed(b):\r\n        c = b.copy()  # create new object...\r\n        c.remove(1)\r\n        return c      # ...and return it\r\n\r\nIt is common for function/method names to reflect whether they actively modify their argument. Modifying functions tend to use active verbs, whereas non-modifying functions tend to use passive verbs or adjectives.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nThere is no &quot;pythonic&quot; choice whether to modify the argument or not - operating on the original or a copy are two fundamentally different operations. Both are valid depending on the use-case.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; items = [4, 3, 10, 2, 5]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; sorted(items)\r\n    [2, 3, 4, 5, 10]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; items.sort()\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; items\r\n    [2, 3, 4, 5, 10]\r\n\r\nIn general, mutating an argument is faster in Python, whereas creating a new result is easier to reason about.\r\nIn specific, comprehensions represent [functional programming][2] operations ([namely ``map`` and ``filter``][3]) -- they are designed not to modify their iterable.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nWhether to return an argument due to modification *only concerns said argument*. For example, ``list.pop`` modifies the list and does not return it -- however, it does return the popped element.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#why-doesn-t-list-sort-return-the-sorted-list\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\r\n  [3]: https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204471/pythonic-way-to-write-a-function-which-modifies-a-list/58205449#58205449","title":"Pythonic way to write a function which modifies a list?"}],"owner":{"reputation":5515,"user_id":1214214,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mE5HL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TheMeaningfulEngineer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1214214/themeaningfulengineer"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":103,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58205449,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570041603,"creation_date":1570029419,"question_id":58204471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204471","body_markdown":"In python function arguments are passed by object reference. \r\nThis means the simplest code to modify a list will modify the object itself.\r\n\r\n```\r\na = [1,2,3]\r\n\r\ndef remove_one(b):\r\n    b.remove(1)\r\n\r\nremove_one(a)\r\nprint(a)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe method `remove_one` returns nothing. If that was a public method one has to assume it will modify the object and isn&#39;t thread safe inside the method.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA second approach would be to structure the code snippet like this:\r\n```\r\na = [1,2,3]\r\n\r\ndef remove_one(b):\r\n    b.remove(1)\r\n    return(b)\r\n\r\nprint(remove_one(a[:]))\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere the content of a wasn&#39;t modified and a new list is returned.

However, instead of using a pie chart I want to draw labeled circles and fill the circle with a color commiserate with a percentage. That part I&#39;ve figured out.\r\n\r\nHowever, the values for the circles can change in response to user input, and I&#39;d love to have an animation that causes the &quot;fill&quot; of the circle to rise or fall as the input is changed. I&#39;m primarily a backend dev, and have almost no experience with animations, I feel like I&#39;m spinning my wheels.\r\n\r\nMy front-end is React. Currently each circle is a React component that I pass a &quot;percentage&quot; property to. I then assign a linear gradient to the circle that varies depending on the percentage passed. This fills the circles the appropriate amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost all animations (if you can really call them that) that I&#39;ve used in the past have used transitions. However, my research has led me to believe that linear-gradients cannot be transitioned - which leaves me in a place where I either have to redo my circle code (which I&#39;m open to, just don&#39;t know how) or figure out a workaround to animate a linear gradient.\r\n\r\n```\r\nrender() {\r\n    let circleStyle = {\r\n      background: `linear-gradient(transparent ${100-this.props.percent}%, ${this.props.color} ${100-this.props.percent}%)`\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;div className=&quot;circle-container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div className=&quot;circle&quot; style={circleStyle} onClick={this.props.onClick}&gt;\r\n        &lt;div className=&quot;circle-info&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;p className=&quot;circle-text&quot;&gt;{this.props.percent}%&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;p className=&quot;circle-text-hidden&quot;&gt;CU Avg: {this.props.industryPercent}%&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          {strike}\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1&gt;{this.props.segmentName}&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    ) \r\n```\r\n\r\nHoping I can get some sage React/CSS-Guru advice about the best way to approach this. It&#39;s in that weird valley of something that FEELS like it should be the simplest thing in the world, but which I can&#39;t stop banging my head against.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204464/animating-a-circle-filling-from-bottom-to-top-by-a-dynamic-percentage","title":"Animating a circle filling from bottom to top by a dynamic percentage"},{"tags":["iphone","katalon-studio","browserstack"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":11608469,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sruz5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lahimadhe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11608469/lahimadhe"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570071662,"post_id":58204462,"comment_id":102800675,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204462/switch-to-frame-issue-on-iphones-browserstack#comment102800675_58204462"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yt6_TnD2Llk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rejOfIHr-qGG4lw7ORWkEvDvSypOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rosario Palacios","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154592/rosario-palacios"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":155,"user_id":11608469,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sruz5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"lahimadhe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11608469/lahimadhe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570088331,"post_id":58204462,"comment_id":102805256,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204462/switch-to-frame-issue-on-iphones-browserstack#comment102805256_58204462"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12154592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yt6_TnD2Llk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rejOfIHr-qGG4lw7ORWkEvDvSypOQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rosario Palacios","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12154592/rosario-palacios"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570029380,"creation_date":1570029380,"question_id":58204462,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204462","body_markdown":"I&#39;m running through BrowserStack some Test Cases created in Katalon in different devices and I&#39;m having the same problem in all the tests when I run them in a iPhone, the method switchToFrame always fail.

I use `set_names()` at the end of the pipe to name the vector with itself, because sometimes I need that for organization later.\r\n\r\n    vars = mpg %&gt;%\r\n         select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;%\r\n         select(-cyl, - year) %&gt;%\r\n         names() %&gt;%\r\n         set_names()\r\n\r\nThe result is a vector of strings.\r\n\r\n    vars\r\n    # displ     cty     hwy \r\n    # &quot;displ&quot;   &quot;cty&quot;   &quot;hwy&quot; \r\n\r\nNow I can loop through those variable names and make a plot against the fixed `x` variable `cyl`.  I&#39;ll use a `purrr::map()` loop for this.  Since I&#39;m working with strings I need to use tidy evaluation within `ggplot()`, done with the `.data` pronoun (I believe this only works since the latest 0.4.0 release of **rlang**).  I label the y axis with the variable in `labs()`, otherwise it has the `.data` pronoun in the axis label.\r\n\r\n    plots = map(vars, ~ggplot(data = mpg) +\r\n                     geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = .data[[.x]]) ) +\r\n                     labs(y = .x)\r\n    )\r\n\r\nI demonstrate the approach above [in a blog post I wrote last year](https://aosmith.rbind.io/2018/08/20/automating-exploratory-plots/) if you&#39;re interested in more explanation.\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to loop through strings like this, another option is to reshape the dataset into a long format and then use the nesting approach.  The idea is to make a long dataset, taking the variables you want on the y axis and putting their values all together in a single column.  I do this with `tidyr::pivot_longer()`.    The numeric values for the `y` variables are now in a single column, named `value`.\r\n\r\nThen nest the `cyl` and `value` columns for each variable name.  Once that is done you&#39;ll have a three row dataset, one row per `y` variable, and you can loop through the datasets in `mutate()` to create your column of plots as in your original attempt.\r\n\r\n    plots2 = mpg %&gt;%\r\n         select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;% \r\n         dplyr::select(-year) %&gt;% \r\n         pivot_longer(cols = -cyl) %&gt;% \r\n         nest(data = -name) %&gt;%\r\n         mutate(ggplots = map(data, \r\n                              ~ggplot(data = .x) + geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = value)))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204452/printing-ggplot-with-purrr-map/58205745#58205745","title":"printing ggplot with purrr map"}],"owner":{"reputation":724,"user_id":3107664,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YKWnp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shery","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3107664/shery"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58205745,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570035256,"creation_date":1570029357,"question_id":58204452,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204452","body_markdown":"I want to create `ggplots` for `numeric cols` against my `response variable`.\r\n\r\nHere is the reproducible code:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ntest = mpg %&gt;% select_if(is.numeric) %&gt;% \r\ndplyr::select(-year) %&gt;% nest(-cyl) %&gt;% \r\nmutate(ggplots = map(data,~ggplot(data = .x) + geom_point(aes(x = cyl, y = .x))))\r\n\r\ntest\r\n# A tibble: 4 x 3\r\n    cyl           data ggplots\r\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&lt;df[,3]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt; \r\n1     4       [81 x 3] &lt;gg&gt;   \r\n2     6       [79 x 3] &lt;gg&gt;   \r\n3     8       [70 x 3] &lt;gg&gt;   \r\n4     5        [4 x 3] &lt;gg&gt;   \r\nWarning message:\r\nAll elements of `...` must be named.\r\nDid you want `data = c(displ, cty, hwy)`? \r\n```\r\n\r\nGetting the error:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ntest$ggplots[[1]]\r\nDon&#39;t know how to automatically pick scale for object of type tbl_df/tbl/data.frame.

Once the ggplot is wrapped in ggplotly function, the horizontal lines disappear:\r\n\r\n    # load the libraries\r\n    library(data.table)\r\n    library(ggplot2)\r\n    library(plotly)\r\n    \r\n    # create example data\r\n    DT &lt;- data.table(x= rep(c(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;, &#39;c&#39;), 1000),\r\n                     y = rpois(3000, lambda = c(2, 3, 5)))\r\n    \r\n    # create violin chart using ggplot\r\n    p &lt;- ggplot(DT, aes(x =x, \r\n                   y = y, \r\n                   fill = x)) +\r\n      geom_violin(draw_quantiles = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75)) \r\n    \r\n    # wrap ggplot in plotly\r\n    ggplotly(p)\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204447/how-to-keep-quantile-lines-in-ggplot-violin-chart-when-using-plotly","title":"How to keep quantile lines in ggplot violin chart when using plotly"},{"tags":["python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":40545,"user_id":2390182,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KKx5r.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"schwobaseggl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2390182/schwobaseggl"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570029621,"post_id":58204445,"comment_id":102787221,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204445/when-to-use-round-function-and-when-else-should-we-use-format-method-to-round-of#comment102787221_58204445"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11849104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6275f9c3334218324ee96ad33ed2ae97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kishanraj16","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11849104/kishanraj16"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570029320,"creation_date":1570029320,"question_id":58204445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204445","body_markdown":"I need a clear distinction between the usage of round function and format in python.

Note that you rather want the opposite, i.e., build a generic image and adjust its behavior by setting environment variables. Still, both approaches are similar.\r\n\r\nIn order to bake the value of an environment variable into an image, you have to specify the value of your environment variable using the `ARG` keyword inside your Dockerfile and pass its value either via `--build-arg` when using `docker build` from the shell, or via the `args` keyword inside your compose file. Consider the following Dockerfile and docker-compose file:\r\n\r\n**Dockerfile**\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM alpine\r\n\r\nARG ENV_BACKEND_URI=$ENV_BACKEND_URI\r\n\r\nRUN mkdir -p /app\r\nRUN echo $ENV_BACKEND_URI &gt; /app/script.sh\r\n\r\nCMD [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;/app/script.sh&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**docker-compose.yml**\r\n```docker-compose\r\nversion: &quot;3.7&quot;\r\n\r\nservices:\r\n  app:\r\n    build:\r\n      context: .\r\n      args:\r\n        ENV_BACKEND_URI: &quot;google.de&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the `ARG` keyword in the Dockerfile we state that we want to use the variable `ENV_BACKEND_URI` at build time and its value shall be equal to the value of the environment `ENV_BACKEND_URI` that we receive during building. We do so in the compose file by using the `arg` keyword.\r\n\r\nUpon invoking `docker-compose build &amp;&amp; docker-compose up` you will eventually see the ouput `app_1  | google.de`. If you prefer using the `docker build` command you have to invoke `docker build --build-arg ENV_BACKEND_URI=google.de --tag=foo .\r\n` first and then execute it by calling `docker run foo`. Both yield the same output, i.e., they print `google.de` to stdout.\r\n\r\nFor your CI/CD use case, you have to set the value of the variable inside your compose file to the value of the variable in the environment, i.e., `ENV_BACKEND_URI: $ENV_BACKEND_URI`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204437/how-to-use-variables-from-gitlab-ci-yml-in-dockerfile/58204857#58204857","title":"How

In no way can it hold a string of multiple characters.\r\n\r\nBut this program does not have to hold a string of multiple characters.  It reads a character and prints it, and reads a character and prints it, etc.\r\n\r\n*If* you were using `scanf %s` to read and store a whole string, and `printf %s` to print that string, then yes, you would need an array of multiple characters.\r\n\r\nBased on the way your loop is written, I would expect it to print the `&#39;.&#39;`, then stop.  Follow it carefully: inside the loop, it reads a character, and prints the character, then it goes &quot;back to the top&quot; off the loop to decide if it should make another trip through thw loop.  (That&#39;s the way `while` loops work.)  After reading and printing the `&#39;.&#39;`, the condition `while(c != &#39;.&#39;)` is no longer true, so the loop stops -- but by then the `&#39;.&#39;` has been printed.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with your compiler.\r\n\r\nYou mentioned `char` going up to 127.  Actually, an 8-bit `char` can hold 2&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; = 256 different values.  We can think of those values as running from -128 to +127 (if `char` is a signed type) or 0 to 255 (if `char` is an unsigned type).  The ordinary ASCII characters always have values less than 128, so there&#39;s never any problem representing those.  The other 128 values can be used in different ways depending on your machine&#39;s character set and encoding.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58204427/char-stores-entire-strings-with-scanf/58204875#58204875","title":"Char stores entire strings with Scanf?"}],"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":4551471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/837900792937473/picture?type=large","display_name":"Dario Deniz Erg&#252;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4551471/dario-deniz-erg%c3%bcn"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58204850,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570148911,"creation_date":1570029276,"question_id":58204427,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58204427","body_markdown":"&lt;br&gt; So i&#39;m taking lessons on C at my university and the professor showed this simple bit of code:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n\r\n    int main() {\r\n        char c;\r\n        scanf(&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;c);\r\n        while (c !=&#39;.&#39;){\r\n            //if(c != &#39;/n&#39;);\r\n            scanf(&quot;%c&quot;, &amp;c);\r\n            printf(&quot;%c&quot;, c);\r\n        }\r\n        return 0;\r\n    }\r\nAnd although for many of you it&#39;s an objectively simple piece of code, i can&#39;t wrap my head around two things.

But the variable i&#39;m storing it in is a type `char`, which only goes up to 127, which based on the ASCII values of the characters i&#39;m typing, isn&#39;t nearly enough so how does it store it? &lt;br&gt;Secondhing is that i&#39;m writing this code from memory (although i think its the exact same one as the one my prof. used). However, in his code the program stops after it detects a full stop &quot;.&quot;, and the program prints its final string without printing the dot, but mine does.
