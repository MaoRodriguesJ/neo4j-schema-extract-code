The draggable word elements each have one of these categories as their type. I want the drop target that they&#39;re being dragged to only accept one of each word category, and I&#39;ve run into really strange behavior from the library for this seemingly simple operation.\r\n\r\nI initially tried instantiating an array, freeCategories, that includes all the word categories, then iterates through the currentPhrase state variable (also an array) and removes each category that is currently in use.\r\n\r\nI thought I could just pass freeCategories in the drop target component&#39;s props and then use that as the value for &#39;accept&#39; in useDrop. That just let anything through no matter what was in the freeCategories array.\r\n\r\nMy second solution was to perform this logic on the drag source object. If the word&#39;s category was still available it would be taken out of freeCategories and its type would be &quot;word-usable&quot; or &quot;word-blocked&quot; if it wasn&#39;t. With the drop target&#39;s accept parameter set to &quot;word-usable&quot; it would still take anything even if its type was returning as &quot;word-blocked&quot;.\r\n\r\nFinally, I tried adding a canDrop property to useDrop. This checked the freeCategories array (passed in props) against the item&#39;s type (now back to the word&#39;s category). This caused the drop target to block everything with canDrop returning false even if the word type was in the array of free categories. When I tried switching the monitor from !!monitor.canDrop to !monitor.canDrop, it now looks like it will accept any word, but when dropped it doesn&#39;t run the drop function.\r\n\r\nThe function that builds the jsx of the phrase:\r\n```js\r\nfunction currentPhraseDisp() {\r\nlet freeCategories = [&quot;Form&quot;, &quot;Element&quot;, &quot;Verb&quot;];\r\n        currentPhrase.forEach(word =&gt; freeCategories.splice(freeCategories.indexOf(word.category), 1));\r\n        let startSpace = currentSpell.length &lt; 3 ? &lt;WordSpace start={true} accepts={freeCategories} addWordToCurrentPhrase={addWordToCurrentPhrase} /&gt; : &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt;;\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n&lt;&gt;\r\n            {startSpace}\r\n            {currentPhrase.map((w, i) =&gt; {\r\n                return (\r\n                    &lt;div key={i} className=&quot;current-phrase-word&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div&gt;{w[&#39;word&#39;]}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;button&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                )\r\n            })}\r\n&lt;/&gt;\r\n)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWords come through as objects in the format {word: &#39;word&#39;, category: &#39;word category&#39;}\r\n\r\nThe dragging logic:\r\n```js\r\nconst [{ isDragging }, drag] = useDrag({\r\n        /*Used in the second solution*/ item: { type: &#39;word-usable&#39;, id: props.word },\r\n        item: { type: props.word.category, id: props.word},\r\n        collect: monitor =&gt; ({\r\n            isDragging: !!monitor.isDragging()\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dropping logic:\r\n```js\r\nconst [{ isOver, canDrop }, drop] = useDrop({\r\n        accept: props.accepts,\r\n        \r\n/*Used in solution 3\r\n        canDrop: (item) =&gt; {\r\n            props.accepts.includes(item.type);\r\n        },\r\n*/\r\n        drop: (item) =&gt; {\r\n            props.addWordToCurrentPhrase(item.id, props.start);\r\n        },\r\n        collect: monitor =&gt; ({\r\n            isOver: !!monitor.isOver(),\r\n            canDrop: !!monitor.canDrop()\r\n        })\r\n    })\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like these components to allow the user to drag only one of any given word type into currentPhrase. So far my results have been that the drop target either accepts all words or no words. If anyone can help me understand what react-dnd is doing here, I&#39;d appreciate it because it seems like it won&#39;t allow any changes to accept or item types on rerender.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495647/accept-and-candrop-usedrop-properties-not-working-properly-to-prevent-taking-d","title":"accept and canDrop (useDrop properties) not

just give it a try, and I can repro your issue. And here are something you need to check.\r\n\r\n1.In you sender(in c#), you should make sure your message to send is correct. Like below:\r\n\r\n        static void SendingRandomMessages()\r\n        {\r\n            var eventHubClient = EventHubClient.CreateFromConnectionString(connectionString, eventHubName);\r\n            int i = 0;\r\n            while (true)\r\n            {\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    // make sure the message is correct.\r\n                    var message = i+&quot;:&quot;+Guid.NewGuid().ToString()+&quot;:&quot;+DateTime.Now;\r\n\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} &gt; Sending message: {1}&quot;, DateTime.Now, message);\r\n                    var myeventdata = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message));\r\n                    eventHubClient.Send(myeventdata);\r\n                    i++;\r\n                    //eventHubClient.Send(new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message)));\r\n                }\r\n                catch (Exception exception)\r\n                {\r\n                    Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;\r\n                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0} &gt; Exception: {1}&quot;, DateTime.Now, exception.Message);\r\n                    Console.ResetColor();\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                Thread.Sleep(2000);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n\r\n2.There seems some delay for the receiver(in python), so I execute the python receiver about 3 times, and I can see the expected output.

Then it returns True/False if the file is in use or not:\r\n\r\n    On Error Resume Next\r\n    Open myFile For Binary Access Read Lock Read As #1\r\n    Close #1\r\n    fileInUse = IIf(Err.Number &gt; 0, True, False)\r\n    On Error GoTo 0\r\n\r\nIt works as it should, but **not** when using URLs.\r\nThe result when using a traditional DOS path, is an error number of 70 when the file is in use, and 0 if not.\r\nThe result when using a URL path is always 75.\r\n\r\n---\r\n    \r\nThe code below is supposedly able to perform the check on SharePoint URLs, but for some reason it&#39;s not working for me:\r\n\r\n    If Workbooks.CanCheckOut(myFile) = True Then\r\n        &#39;Open file\r\n    Else\r\n        &#39;Run procedure to wait a few seconds and then try again\r\n    End If\r\n\r\nIt always returns True, disregarding if the file is currently in use or not.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n***The expected result is:***\r\n\r\nIf myFile is currently in use:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;Wait a few seconds and try again.&lt;/ul&gt;\r\nIf it&#39;s not:\r\n&lt;ul&gt;Continue with uploading procedure.&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\nmyfile will only be accessed programmatically, so the only times when it will not be available is when other user is currently running the upload procedure somewhere else, and this will take around 5 seconds.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAny suggestions or comments are very much appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495607/how-to-bypass-file-in-use-prompt-when-opening-an-excel-file-when-in-use-by-so","title":"How to bypass &quot;File in use&quot; prompt when opening an Excel file (when in use by someone else) from a SharePoint URL?"},{"tags":["entity-framework","asp.net-core","razor-pages"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571721143,"post_id":58495605,"comment_id":103323955,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495605/ef-and-asp-net-core-cannot-generate-a-controller#comment103323955_58495605"},{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9623715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f8a66ba5ab14db5de3e3e9bf82a362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"curiousMinded","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9623715/curiousminded"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571725939,"post_id":58495605,"comment_id":103325564,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495605/ef-and-asp-net-core-cannot-generate-a-controller#comment103325564_58495605"},{"owner":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571726490,"post_id":58495605,"comment_id":103325805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495605/ef-and-asp-net-core-cannot-generate-a-controller#comment103325805_58495605"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":9623715,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29f8a66ba5ab14db5de3e3e9bf82a362?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"curiousMinded","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9623715/curiousminded"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571726648,"post_id":58498370,"comment_id":103325877,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495605/ef-and-asp-net-core-cannot-generate-a-controller/58498370#comment103325877_58498370"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11874,"user_id":5751404,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VpggY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nan Yu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5751404/nan-yu"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571726299,"creation_date":1571726299,"answer_id":58498370,"question_id":58495605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58498370","body_markdown":"In your `appsettings.json` , the connection string has name `MvcMovieContext` which is not the same as the section name in `UseSqlite` --`MvcCallContext`.It should be :\r\n\r\n    services.AddDbContext&lt;MvcCallContext&gt;(options =&gt;\r\n        options.UseSqlite(Configuration.GetConnectionString(&quot;MvcMovieContext&quot;)));","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495605/ef-and-asp-net-core-cannot-generate-a-controller/58498370#58498370","title":"EF and asp-.net-core -

So to make it more efficient, the application does not download objects on the local disk and upload them again, but it streams the files in 5MB chunks and compress them on the fly. The challenge I am facing is in order to provide progress on this operation, I need to rely on the total size of all the objects and use a counter to see how much from the total size is handled as the source of calculating the progress. \r\n\r\nThe challenge I have been facing is in order to get the size of objects, I need to iterate through all the objects first and get the size one by one and calculate the total before starting the process. However, this is going to be too slow as there might be millions of objects which means millions of API calls. If I try to calculate the size before starting the compression, this calculation process will take more than the actual compression and it defeats the whole purpose. Therefore, I was wondering if there is any way I can pass the list of objects via a single API call and receive the total size. I know there is a way to add a prefix and get the prefix match for all the objects that match a prefix, but since objects may get stored with different prefixes, this approach will not work.\r\n\r\nThe following code snippet is how I can get the object size one by one:\r\n\r\n    public Long getObjectSize(AmazonS3Client amazonS3Client, String bucket, String key)\r\n            throws IOException {\r\n        return amazonS3Client.getObjectMetadata(bucket, key).getContentLength();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNOTE: If I relied on the number of objects to calculate the progress, that wouldn&#39;t be accurate at all. Some objects are 2-3KB and some of them are quite big (1-2GB).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495562/get-the-size-of-objects-on-s3-with-a-single-api-call","title":"Get the size of objects on S3 with a single API call"},{"tags":["grep","expression"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12145352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a91199ff39b849800551fa910a0141?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaelPJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145352/maelpj"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571703328,"post_id":58495561,"comment_id":103320926,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495561/how-to-find-match-of-words-with-reoccuring-character-in-a-file#comment103320926_58495561"},{"owner":{"reputation":3824,"user_id":3120884,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/116656a5f0b09d1a524808706d709d9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"stevesliva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3120884/stevesliva"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571712294,"post_id":58495561,"comment_id":103322326,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495561/how-to-find-match-of-words-with-reoccuring-character-in-a-file#comment103322326_58495561"},{"owner":{"reputation":365176,"user_id":3832970,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/64323e6cf08401474da3bf770ea13b58?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Wiktor Stribiżew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3832970/wiktor-stribi%c5%bcew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571724269,"post_id":58495561,"comment_id":103324869,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495561/how-to-find-match-of-words-with-reoccuring-character-in-a-file#comment103324869_58495561"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":12145352,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10a91199ff39b849800551fa910a0141?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MaelPJ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12145352/maelpj"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571703117,"creation_date":1571703117,"question_id":58495561,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495561","body_markdown":"It might seems like a question that would already have been answered before so pardon me if it&#39;s the case, but I can&#39;t seems to find a clear answer or an explanation on how to find words in a file with a specified number of repeated character, (ex: words containing 3 times the character &#39;-&#39;, such as &#39;long-and-complex-word&#39;).\r\n\r\nI&#39;m aware that it is possible to use the command\r\n\r\n    grep-oE &#39;.{n}&#39;\r\nTo find words with consecutive repetition of character, but I&#39;m looking for a way to find repetition of character in no particular order.\r\n\r\nHere are the commands that I&#39;ve tried that aren&#39;t working\r\n\r\n    grep -E &#39;*[-]*[-]*[-]*&#39;

Specifically it seems to be effecting blur on small images. They look fine on desktop (windows), but on mobile safari the smaller the image gets the more extreme the blur becomes until the edges of the blur overflow the bounding box and start clipping, causing a sharp edge instead of the normal gradually fading edge. I&#39;ve got this simple blurred square (below). On desktop I get a small gray box with blurred edges that gradually fade away. In mobile safari I get a gray box with edges that start fading but the blur is so strong it overflows the filter box and gets clipped. \r\n\r\nIf I make this same image 500px x 500px, the clipping error goes away.\r\n\r\nNaturally this is on much more complex images. All my dropped shadows are a blurry mess. I thought the issue would be obvious once I got it simplified down to a single object, but I&#39;m at a bit of a loss of what else to troubleshoot and I haven&#39;t been able to find anything on google.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any suggestion on things to try?\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n            &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot; standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- Created with Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org/) --&gt;\r\n        \r\n        &lt;svg\r\n           xmlns:dc=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/&quot;\r\n           xmlns:cc=&quot;http://creativecommons.org/ns#&quot;\r\n           xmlns:rdf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;\r\n           xmlns:svg=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;\r\n           xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;\r\n           xmlns:sodipodi=&quot;http://sodipodi.sourceforge.net/DTD/sodipodi-0.dtd&quot;\r\n           xmlns:inkscape=&quot;http://www.inkscape.org/namespaces/inkscape&quot;\r\n           width=&quot;50px&quot;\r\n           height=&quot;50px&quot;\r\n           viewBox=&quot;0 0 50 50&quot;\r\n           version=&quot;1.1&quot;\r\n           id=&quot;svg2900&quot;\r\n           inkscape:version=&quot;0.92.4 (5da689c313, 2019-01-14)&quot;\r\n           sodipodi:docname=&quot;test.svg&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;defs\r\n             id=&quot;defs2894&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;filter\r\n               inkscape:collect=&quot;always&quot;\r\n               filterRes=&quot;50&quot;\r\n               style=&quot;color-interpolation-filters:sRGB&quot;\r\n               id=&quot;filter3479&quot;\r\n               x=&quot;-5.867403%&quot;\r\n               width=&quot;111.73481%&quot;\r\n               y=&quot;-6.1387286%&quot;\r\n               height=&quot;112.27746%&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;feGaussianBlur\r\n                 inkscape:collect=&quot;always&quot;\r\n                 stdDeviation=&quot;3&quot;\r\n                 id=&quot;feGaussianBlur3481&quot; /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/filter&gt;\r\n          &lt;/defs&gt;\r\n          &lt;sodipodi:namedview\r\n             id=&quot;base&quot;\r\n             pagecolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;\r\n             bordercolor=&quot;#666666&quot;\r\n             borderopacity=&quot;1.0&quot;\r\n             inkscape:pageopacity=&quot;0.0&quot;\r\n             inkscape:pageshadow=&quot;2&quot;\r\n             inkscape:zoom=&quot;7.2407734&quot;\r\n             inkscape:cx=&quot;55.355565&quot;\r\n             inkscape:cy=&quot;10.669427&quot;\r\n             inkscape:document-units=&quot;mm&quot;\r\n             inkscape:current-layer=&quot;layer1&quot;\r\n             showgrid=&quot;false&quot;\r\n             units=&quot;px&quot; /&gt;\r\n          &lt;metadata\r\n             id=&quot;metadata2897&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;rdf:RDF&gt;\r\n              &lt;cc:Work\r\n                 rdf:about=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;dc:format&gt;image/svg+xml&lt;/dc:format&gt;\r\n                &lt;dc:type\r\n                   rdf:resource=&quot;http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/StillImage&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;dc:title&gt;&lt;/dc:title&gt;\r\n              &lt;/cc:Work&gt;\r\n            &lt;/rdf:RDF&gt;\r\n          &lt;/metadata&gt;\r\n          &lt;g\r\n             inkscape:label=&quot;Layer 1&quot;\r\n             inkscape:groupmode=&quot;layer&quot;\r\n             id=&quot;layer1&quot;\r\n             transform=&quot;translate(0,-283.77083)&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;rect\r\n               style=&quot;fill:#808080;fill-opacity:1;fill-rule:evenodd;stroke:#000000;stroke-width:0.26458332px;stroke-linecap:butt;stroke-linejoin:miter;stroke-opacity:1;filter:url(#filter3479)&quot;\r\n               id=&quot;rect3445&quot;\r\n               width=&quot;148.88914&quot;\r\n               height=&quot;197.21333&quot;\r\n               x=&quot;42.422787&quot;\r\n               y=&quot;74.466438&quot;\r\n               transform=&quot;matrix(0.07946474,0,0,0.05948087,-0.40460229,282.00232)&quot; /&gt;\r\n          &lt;/g&gt;\r\n        &lt;/svg&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n[Safari Screenshot][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Desktop Screenshot][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother example with an inset shadow shows how the blur gets more intense as the image goes smaller.

Which means create an array from a range starting at 1 to 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/closedrange\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495555/how-to-assign-a-variable-range-of-numbers-and-reuse-it-on-a-function/58495604#58495604","title":"How to assign a variable range of numbers and reuse it on a function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9794657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1fcc288ef6a260313aa579f8eb47f6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bou Bou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9794657/bou-bou"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9794657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b1fcc288ef6a260313aa579f8eb47f6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bou Bou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9794657/bou-bou"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58495604,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571703697,"creation_date":1571703031,"last_edit_date":1571703217,"question_id":58495555,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495555","body_markdown":"I got a function who calculate numbers, but I need to calculate numbers one by one in the range of 1 to 100, so I did a variable who have a range of 1...100 but still have the same error at the line where I call my function : Cannot convert value of type &#39;ClosedRange&lt;Int&gt;&#39;

I suggest you open an [issue](https://github.com/harrelfe/Hmisc/issues) with a feature-request.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, here&#39;s a replacement that allows you to control it a little:\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\nprint.rcorr &lt;- function(x, ..., digits = getOption(&quot;Hmisc.rcorr.digits&quot;, 4))\r\n{\r\n  print(round(x$r,2))\r\n  n &lt;- x$n\r\n  if(all(n == n[1,1]))\r\n    cat(&quot;\\nn=&quot;, n[1,1], &quot;\\n\\n&quot;)\r\n  else {\r\n    cat(&quot;\\nn\\n&quot;)\r\n    print(n)\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n  cat(&quot;\\nP\\n&quot;)\r\n  P &lt;- x$P\r\n  P &lt;- ifelse(P &lt; .0001, 0, P)\r\n  p &lt;- format(round(P, digits))\r\n  p[is.na(P)] &lt;- &quot;&quot;\r\n  print(p, quote=FALSE)\r\n  invisible()\r\n}\r\n\r\nprint(cor.table, digits=2)\r\n#       X1    X2    Y1    Y2\r\n# X1  1.00 -0.50  0.31  0.34\r\n# X2 -0.50  1.00 -0.50 -0.61\r\n# Y1  0.31 -0.50  1.00  0.74\r\n# Y2  0.34 -0.61  0.74  1.00\r\n# n= 75 \r\n# P\r\n#    X1   X2   Y1   Y2  \r\n# X1      0.00 0.01 0.00\r\n# X2 0.00      0.00 0.00\r\n# Y1 0.01 0.00      0.00\r\n# Y2 0.00 0.00 0.00     \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis &quot;should&quot; always mask `Hmisc:::print.rcorr`. I added the ability to use an `options` controller, so you can even do\r\n\r\n```lang-r\r\noptions(&quot;Hmisc.rcorr.digits&quot; = 2)\r\ncor.table\r\n#       X1    X2    Y1    Y2\r\n# X1  1.00 -0.50  0.31  0.34\r\n# X2 -0.50  1.00 -0.50 -0.61\r\n# Y1  0.31 -0.50  1.00  0.74\r\n# Y2  0.34 -0.61  0.74  1.00\r\n# n= 75 \r\n# P\r\n#    X1   X2   Y1   Y2  \r\n# X1      0.00 0.01 0.00\r\n# X2 0.00      0.00 0.00\r\n# Y1 0.01 0.00      0.00\r\n# Y2 0.00 0.00 0.00     \r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, two words of caution:\r\n\r\n- though I didn&#39;t test well and I think it&#39;s robust enough, it might be possible for some method of loading packages to use `Hmisc:::print.rcorr` instead of your global-defined version ... I&#39;ll have to think a little about namespaces and search path to know if this can unintentionally happen; and\r\n- if/when `Hmisc` updates their function, you should probably update this function as well.

I am trying to do is getting the login user&#39;s information from the login component, so that the App component could pass the login user&#39;s information to the main component.\r\n\r\nHere is some code in the App.js:\r\n```\r\nstate = {\r\n   usersArr: [],     // all the users\r\n   logInUser: 0,    // the login user, default value as 0\r\n}\r\ngetLogInUser = () =&gt; {\r\n    return this.state.logInUser;\r\n}\r\nassignLogInUser = user =&gt;{\r\n    this.setState({logInUser: user});\r\n    console.log(&quot;LogIn: &quot; + this.state.logInUser.username);\r\n\r\n}\r\nrender(){\r\nreturn(\r\n    &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;Router&gt;\r\n            &lt;div className=&quot;App&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;Switch&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Route path=&quot;/main&quot; exact render={() =&gt; &lt;Main logInUser={() =&gt; this.getLogInUser()}/&gt;}/&gt;\r\n                    &lt;Route path=&quot;&quot; exact render={() =&gt; &lt;Landing usersArr={this.state.usersArr} getUser = {this.assignLogInUser}/&gt;}&gt;&lt;/Route&gt;\r\n                &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/Router&gt;\r\n)\r\n}   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first page would be landing page and the landing component would be rendered. The landing component will render the login component. The login component will check if the username and password from input would match any user in the usersArr. If it does match, the login component will call the assignLogInUser to assign the login user.\r\n\r\nlanding.jsx:\r\n```\r\nrender(){\r\n   return(\r\n       &lt;Login usersArr={this.props.usersArr} getUser={this.props.getUser}/&gt;\r\n   )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nlogin.jsx:\r\n```\r\nconstructor(props){\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.userName = React.createRef();    // username referrence\r\n        this.password = React.createRef();    // password referrence\r\n    }\r\nvalidateLogin = () =&gt; {\r\n    this.props.usersArr.forEach(user =&gt; {\r\n        if(user.username === this.userName.current.value &amp;&amp; user.password === this.password.current.value){\r\n                this.props.getUser(user);\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the logInUser passed into the main is always 0. \r\n\r\nLooks like once the route has been set up, it will never update the component it&#39;s going to render. No matter what I tried, I would get the default value 0 for logInUser in the main component.\r\n\r\nI can probably use redux, but I have to refactor all of the code.\r\n\r\nI have tried forceUpdate() in the main component, or using key in the main component. None of them works.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495521/the-props-of-a-component-rendered-inside-a-route-will-never-update","title":"The props

Python, `yield` is used for [generation][1]. For example:\r\n```\r\ndef func():\r\n    i =0\r\n    while True:\r\n        i += 1\r\n        yield i\r\n```\r\nIf I remember Python correctly, this should allow this function to basically pause execution and get called over and over again. This can generate some sequence like `{0,1,2,3...}`.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `return` just returns a single value and ends execution:\r\n```\r\ndef func():\r\n    i =0\r\n    while True:\r\n        i += 1\r\n        return i\r\n```\r\nThis should always return `0`, since the function ends execution completely so `i` goes out of scope every time.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, C++ has no direct real equivalent to `yield` as far as I&#39;m aware (except for apparently [in the new C++20][2], which is adding an equivalent), where as it does have an equivalent (in all versions) to `return` here. It is, of course, called `return`.\r\n\r\nThat said, C++ can achieve something similar to our yield example using [static variables][3]:\r\n```\r\nint func() {\r\n    static i = 0;\r\n    return i++;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nHowever, that is not to say that static variables are replacements for `yield` in C++. It&#39;s just that you can sort of achieve the same thing in C++ with static variables in this (and possibly other) example(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, in short, `return` ends execution of a function in both languages whereas `yield` allows a function to sort of resume execution. There is no real equivalent for Python&#39;s `yield` in C++ until at least [C++20][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generators\r\n  [2]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/coroutines\r\n  [3]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/static","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495517/how-are-yield-and-return-different-from-one-another/58495693#58495693","title":"How are yield and return different from one another?"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":12136319,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3c62677bd0dc417df8179e417a31650c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"problematic Dude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12136319/problematic-dude"},"last_editor":{"reputation":77038,"user_id":355230,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VjcbL.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"martineau","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/355230/martineau"},"comment_count":14,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571759254,"creation_date":1571702511,"last_edit_date":1571706598,"question_id":58495517,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495517","body_markdown":"I encountered this term frequently that this function yields somethings or this function return something.

trying to recursively run **net.connect(port, host)** so that it retries a set number of times while the connection fails (net.Socket.connect returns false), with the desired output being a Boolean representing whether the connection ultimately succeeded or failed.  Logically, I could use a for loop based on a provided value of **retries**, but I&#39;m trying to avoid an eslint *Disallow Functions in Loops (no-loop-func)* error.  Here&#39;s my code for the basic (no retries) implementation of net.connect(port, host).  How would I implement this recursively?\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\r\n\r\ncheckPort(host, port, callback) {\r\n    try {\r\n      const socket = new net.Socket();\r\n      let status = false;\r\n      socket.connect(port, host, () =&gt; {\r\n        status = true;\r\n        socket.setTimeout(1000, () =&gt; socket.destroy());\r\n      });\r\n      socket.setTimeout(1000);\r\n      socket.on(&#39;timeout&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n        socket.destroy();\r\n      });\r\n      socket.on(&#39;close&#39;, () =&gt; callback(status, null));\r\n      \r\n      return callback(status, null);\r\n    } catch (err) {\r\n      return callback(null, err);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nThe following would appear to call the net.connect recursively, but it only does so once before closing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst net = require(&#39;net&#39;);\r\n\r\nconst socket = new net.Socket();\r\nconst port = 8080;\r\nconst host = &#39;pizza.com&#39;;\r\nconst retries = 5;\r\nlet attempt;\r\nlet status = false;\r\n\r\nfunction tryConnect(attempts) {\r\n  socket.connect(port, host);\r\n  socket.setTimeout(100);\r\n  attempt = attempts;\r\n}\r\n\r\n// this behave normally\r\nsocket.on(&#39;connect&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  status = true;\r\n  console.log(status);\r\n  console.log(&#39;Connected to&#39;, host, &#39;on&#39;, port);\r\n  socket.destroy();\r\n});\r\n\r\n// this unexpectedly leads to just one attempt to connect before closing\r\nsocket.on(&#39;timeout&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  attempt += 1;\r\n  if (attempt &lt;= retries) {\r\n    console.log(&#39;Connection failed. Retrying (Attempt &#39;, attempt, &#39;of&#39;, retries, &#39;).&#39;);\r\n    tryConnect(attempt);\r\n  } else {\r\n    console.log(&#39;Connection to&#39;, host, &#39;on port&#39;, port, &#39;failed.&#39;);\r\n    socket.destroy();\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nsocket.on(&#39;close&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(&#39;Connection closed&#39;);\r\n});\r\n\r\nsocket.on(&#39;error&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n  console.log(status);\r\n});\r\n\r\ntryConnect(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat should I have done differently in structuring this?  Also, does a net.Socket have to be destroyed, ended, or closed before I can reattempt a connection?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495508/how-do-i-recursively-run-net-sockets-connectport-host","title":"How do I recursively run net.Sockets.connect(port, host)?"},{"tags":["r","ggplot2","time-series"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7055,"user_id":4125751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1821c6fd912db5a19d5b78627d100ca3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thothal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4125751/thothal"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571742050,"creation_date":1571742050,"answer_id":58502761,"question_id":58495506,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58502761","body_markdown":"Originally I was hoping to provide a different `geom` to `stat_peaks` but this path did not lead me anywhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, I could think of this workaround:\r\n\r\nLooking at `ggpmisc::StatPeaks$compute_group` you will find that the working horse function is `ggpmisc:::find_peaks`, which you can use to retrieve the peak data and add a smoother like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```R\r\np &lt;- ggplot(df, aes(x=dates , y=freq)) +\r\n          xlab(&quot;&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) +\r\n          tidyquant::theme_tq() +\r\n          theme(axis.title.y = element_text(face = &quot;bold&quot;, size = 8))+\r\n          geom_line(color = &quot;black&quot;, size = 0.5) +\r\n          scale_x_date(date_labels = &quot;%b/%Y&quot;, date_breaks = &quot;5 year&quot;) +\r\n          ggpmisc::stat_peaks(colour           = &quot;blue&quot;,  \r\n                              span             = 9, \r\n                              size             = 1.5, \r\n                              ignore_threshold = 0.001) +\r\n          scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 100)) +\r\n          labs(title = &quot;&quot;)\r\n\r\np + geom_smooth(data = df[ggpmisc:::find_peaks(df$freq, \r\n                                               span = 9, \r\n                                               ignore_threshold = 0.001), ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces the following plot:\r\n[![Smoother][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gaPHy.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495506/plotting-an-smoothing-line-on-maximum-points-using-ggplot/58502761#58502761","title":"Plotting an smoothing line on maximum points using ggplot"}],"owner":{"reputation":1251,"user_id":6935834,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iG0Wf.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Majid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6935834/majid"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58502761,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571742050,"creation_date":1571702376,"question_id":58495506,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495506","body_markdown":"I am struggling to plot below dataframe using `ggplot` so that I can further fit a second smoothing line on the blue points.

The string provides storage for each string and the vector container provides an easy way to collect any number of strings together.\r\n\r\nYour vector-of-strings (`vs`) can be declared as:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;vs {};\r\n\r\n[std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) provides the `.push_back()` member function to add an element (a `string` in this case) to the vector, e.g.\r\n\r\n        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;vs {};\r\n        std::string s;\r\n        \r\n        while (std::cin &gt;&gt; s)\r\n            vs.push_back(s);\r\n\r\nWhich simply reads string `s` until `EOF` is encountered, and each string read is added to the vector-of-strings using `vs.push_back(s);`.\r\n\r\nPutting it altogether you could do:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;vector&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main (void) {\r\n        \r\n        std::vector&lt;std::string&gt;vs {};\r\n        std::string s;\r\n        \r\n        while (std::cin &gt;&gt; s)  /* read each string into s */\r\n            vs.push_back(s);   /* add s to vector of strings */\r\n        \r\n        for (auto&amp; w : vs)     /* output each word using range-based loop */\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; w &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ echo &quot;my dog has fleas&quot; | ./bin/readcintostrings\r\n    my\r\n    dog\r\n    has\r\n    fleas\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495487/is-there-a-way-to-make-c-take-in-an-undefined-number-of-strings-from-cin/58495589#58495589","title":"Is there a way to make C++ take in an undefined number of strings from cin?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571755273,"post_id":58495703,"comment_id":103341656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495487/is-there-a-way-to-make-c-take-in-an-undefined-number-of-strings-from-cin/58495703#comment103341656_58495703"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6906586,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec02e4b2915d7d6d30e5919909682dfe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"roger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6906586/roger"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571860908,"post_id":58495703,"comment_id":103384232,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495487/is-there-a-way-to-make-c-take-in-an-undefined-number-of-strings-from-cin/58495703#comment103384232_58495703"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6906586,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec02e4b2915d7d6d30e5919909682dfe?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"roger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6906586/roger"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571704604,"creation_date":1571704604,"answer_id":58495703,"question_id":58495487,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58495703","body_markdown":"I figured it out using this code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n  std::string testTemp;\r\n  std::string brokenUp[20];\r\n  int lastOne = 0;\r\n\r\n  std::cout &lt;&lt;

Kirill Simonov&#39;s answer is right and typesafe (an alternative would be to create an annotation instance using Kotlin reflection but it is not typesafe).\r\n\r\nHere are some problems with my original code and thoughts about the original approach:\r\n\r\n1. **You should consistently override `_hasAnnotation` and `_getAnnotation`**\r\n\r\nYou cannot be sure that `_getAnnotation` will be called after `_hasAnnotation` check. You cannot be sure which of them will be used to check your replaced annotation (`@JsonIgnore` in my case) without looking into `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector` code. It seems that overriding them consistently would be a good practice. So we should also add the following override to our class if we want to use this approach:\r\n\r\n```kotlin\r\noverride fun &lt;A : Annotation&gt; _hasAnnotation(\r\n    annotated: Annotated,\r\n    annoClass: Class&lt;A&gt;\r\n): Boolean {\r\n    if (annoClass == JsonIgnore::class.java &amp;&amp; _hasAnnotation(annotated, MyJsonIgnore::class.java)) {\r\n        return true\r\n    }\r\n    return super._hasAnnotation(annotated, annoClass)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. **`_getAnnotation` return type should be nullable**\r\n\r\nThis was correctly fixed by Kirill but was not explicitly pointed out. `_getAnnotation` can and will return null sometimes.\r\n\r\n3. **You (probably) cannot have one magic `MyConditional` annotation.**\r\n\r\nKirill&#39;s answer may encourage you to create something like a conditional annotation for all the jackson annotation which could be used as follows:\r\n```kt\r\n@MyConditional([\r\n    JsonIgnore, JsonProperty(&quot;propertyName&quot;)\r\n])\r\n``` \r\n\r\nYou just cannot have polymorphic annotation parameter. You would have to create `My*` for every Jackson annotation you need and for annotation with parameters it&#39;s not as neat as with `@MyJsonIgnore`.\r\n\r\n&lt;s&gt;You can try to make a repeatable annotation which would be applied like below and instantiated using reflection.\r\n```kotlin\r\n@MyConditional(\r\n    clazz = JsonProperty::class.java,\r\n    args = [\r\n        // Ah, you probably cannot have an array of any possible args here, forget it.\r\n    ]\r\n)\r\n```\r\n&lt;/s&gt;\r\n\r\n4. **`_hasAnnotation` and `_getAnnotation` are not the only ways which `JacksonAnnotationIntrospector` uses to get or check for annotations**\r\n\r\nAfter using similar approach to create conditional `@JsonProperty` annotation I&#39;ve noticed that it does not work for enum elements. After some debugging I found out that `findEnumValues` method uses `java.lang.reflect.Field::getAnnotation` directly (due to &quot;various reasons&quot; mentioned in deprecated `findEnumValue`). If you want your conditional annotation to work you should override (at least) `findEnumValues`.\r\n\r\n5. **Be careful with `ObjectMapper::setAnnotationIntrospector`**\r\n\r\nWell, its Javadoc explicitly says it: be careful. It replaces the whole annotation introspector of your mapper removing all the added (chained) by modules Introspectors. It did not appear in my code in the question (it was for the sake of creating minimal example) but actually I&#39;ve accidentally broke deserialization with `KotlinModule`. You may want to consider implementing JacksonModule and appending your introspector to existing ones.\r\n\r\n6. **Consider another approach: implementing functionality-specific methods in `NopAnnotationIntrospector`.**\r\n\r\nAt the end I ended up with this approach (mostly because of 4.). I needed to override `findEnumValues` and `hasIgnoreMarker` and it was enough for me. It involved a bit of copy-paste code from `JacksonAnnotationMapper` but unless you have to make a lot of the annotation conditional it might work (in any case implementing it involves a lot of boilerplate code). This way it&#39;s likely that you really want to chain this introspector, not to `set` it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58495480/how-to-properly-override-jacksonannotationintrospector-findannotation-to-replac/58531275#58531275","title":"How to properly override JacksonAnnotationIntrospector._findAnnotation to replace an annotation of the element"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":4138353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91c07114028f76e00650677765e35f44?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kirill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4138353/kirill"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69,"user_id":4138353,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/91c07114028f76e00650677765e35f44?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kirill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4138353/kirill"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58496220,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571866420,"creation_date":1571702063,"last_edit_date":1571702629,"question_id":58495480,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58495480","body_markdown":"I am trying to create some classes serializable by Jackson.

So I was hoping to store the URL within the table.\r\n\r\nThis is my current code for the login page:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    session_start();\r\n    $conn=mysqli_connect(&#39;localhost&#39;,&#39;dblogin&#39;,&#39;dbpassw&#39;,&#39;dbname&#39;);\r\n    //Getting Input value\r\n    if(isset($_POST[&#39;login&#39;])){\r\n      $username=mysqli_real_escape_string($conn,$_POST[&#39;username&#39;]);\r\n      $password=mysqli_real_escape_string($conn,$_POST[&#39;password&#39;]);\r\n      if(empty($username)&amp;&amp;empty($password)){\r\n      $error= &#39;Fields are Mandatory&#39;;\r\n      }else{\r\n     //Checking Login Detail\r\n     $result=mysqli_query($conn,&quot;SELECT*FROM user WHERE username=&#39;$username&#39; AND password=&#39;$password&#39;&quot;);\r\n     $row=mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\r\n     $count=mysqli_num_rows($result);\r\n     if($count==1){\r\n        $_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;]=array(\r\n       &#39;username&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;username&#39;],\r\n       &#39;password&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;password&#39;],\r\n       &#39;role&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;role&#39;],\r\n       &#39;displayname&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;displayname&#39;],\r\n       &#39;url&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;url&#39;]\r\n       );\r\n       $role=$_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;role&#39;];\r\n       //Redirecting User Based on Role\r\n        switch($role){\r\n      case &#39;consult&#39;:\r\n      header(&#39;location:lib-consult.php&#39;);\r\n     break;\r\n     case &#39;ffa&#39;:\r\n     header(&#39;location:lib-ffa.php&#39;);\r\n     break;\r\n     case &#39;admin&#39;:\r\n     header(&#39;location:lib-admin.php&#39;);\r\n     break;\r\n      \r\n     }\r\n     }else{\r\n     $error=&#39;Your Password or Username is not Found&#39;;\r\n     }\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\nThis is what I have tried:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    session_start();\r\n    $conn=mysqli_connect(&#39;localhost&#39;,&#39;dblogin&#39;,&#39;dbpassw&#39;,&#39;dbname&#39;);\r\n    //Getting Input value\r\n    if(isset($_POST[&#39;login&#39;])){\r\n      $username=mysqli_real_escape_string($conn,$_POST[&#39;username&#39;]);\r\n      $password=mysqli_real_escape_string($conn,$_POST[&#39;password&#39;]);\r\n      if(empty($username)&amp;&amp;empty($password)){\r\n      $error= &#39;Fields are Mandatory&#39;;\r\n      }else{\r\n     //Checking Login Detail\r\n     $result=mysqli_query($conn,&quot;SELECT*FROM user WHERE username=&#39;$username&#39; AND password=&#39;$password&#39;&quot;);\r\n     $row=mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);\r\n     $count=mysqli_num_rows($result);\r\n     if($count==1){\r\n          $_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;]=array(\r\n       &#39;username&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;username&#39;],\r\n       &#39;password&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;password&#39;],\r\n       &#39;role&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;role&#39;],\r\n       &#39;displayname&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;displayname&#39;],\r\n       &#39;url&#39;=&gt;$row[&#39;url&#39;]\r\n       $redirect = mysqli_query(&quot;SELECT url FROM members&quot;);\r\n    while ($row = mysqli_fetch_array($redirect, MYSQL_ASSOC)) {\r\n       header(&quot;Location: &quot; . $row[&#39;url&#39;]);\r\n    }\r\n    exit();\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n    echo &quot;Wrong Username or Password&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n    ?&gt;  \r\n\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t work as the page does not load i.e. there is just a white screen. i&#39;m not sure where I am falling over. I have tried checking tutorials and documents but I still come up short.\r\n\r\nHow do I implement the reference so that when a user is looked up, the corresponding url is used as their landing page?\r\n\r\n\r\nI am also curious about how the check session code may change as I currently have this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    session_start();\r\n    //Checking User Logged or Not\r\n    if(empty($_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;])){\r\n     header(&#39;location:login.php&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    //Restrict User or Moderator to Access Admin.php page\r\n    if($_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;role&#39;]==&#39;consult&#39;){\r\n     header(&#39;location:lib-consult.php&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    if($_SESSION[&#39;user&#39;][&#39;role&#39;]==&#39;ffa&#39;){\r\n     header(&#39;location:lib-ffa.php&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\nAny advice, recommendation or errors noted would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nUpdate to ADyson\r\nI followed what you recommended and it worked the way I was planning for. Thanks for your assistance.\r\n\r\nUpdate to Dharman and Adyson\r\nWould adding this line protect the username and password during transfer?
