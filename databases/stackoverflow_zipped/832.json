The `pattern` is expanded to produce a pattern just as in pathname expansion. `Parameter` is expanded and the longest match of `pattern` against its value is replaced with `string`.&lt;br&gt;\r\n&gt; If `pattern` begins with `/`, all matches of `pattern` are replaced with `string`.

It needs to be escaped to represent itself.\r\n* `+( )` is an extended pattern (it means &quot;one or more of the patterns present between parenthesis&quot;); it works only when the `extglob` shell option is enabled (using `shopt`); apparently it is enabled by default but in scripts you cannot rely on default values; you better set it to be sure it works;\r\n* `${Y%\\~}` is another parameter expansion (it is also explained in the documentation); it removes from `$Y` the last matching suffix (`~`); as explained above `~` needs to be escaped (`\\~`) to be interpreted as itself and not as the home directory.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344601/replace-spaces-with-in-bash-with-no-external-command/58344965#58344965","title":"Replace spaces with ~ in (ba)sh with no external command"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2492,"user_id":7939871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1199ba5dde05e4083823a058c5ac6bed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"L&#233;a Gris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7939871/l%c3%a9a-gris"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2492,"user_id":7939871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1199ba5dde05e4083823a058c5ac6bed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"L&#233;a Gris","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7939871/l%c3%a9a-gris"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570812633,"last_edit_date":1570812633,"creation_date":1570810701,"answer_id":58345101,"question_id":58344601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58345101","body_markdown":"A POSIX shell solution:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n#!/usr/bin/env sh\r\n\r\nmystring=&quot;topo pippo    pluto   &quot;\r\n\r\n# Disable pathname expansion so the parameters expansion\r\n# will not capture pathes if mystring contains patterns\r\nset -f\r\n\r\n# Feed mystring as arguments list\r\n# where each space separated element (word) is an argument\r\nset -- $mystring\r\n\r\n# Restore pathname expansion\r\nset +f\r\n\r\n# Set ~ as the field separator\r\nIFS=&#39;~&#39;\r\n\r\n# Expand the parameters into mystring with ~ as separator\r\nmystring=&quot;$*&quot;\r\n\r\n# Restore the default field separator\r\nunset IFS\r\n\r\necho &quot;$mystring&quot; # Print topo~pippo~pluto\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344601/replace-spaces-with-in-bash-with-no-external-command/58345101#58345101","title":"Replace spaces with ~ in (ba)sh with no external command"}],"owner":{"reputation":13921,"user_id":16827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xMFTQ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Remo.D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/16827/remo-d"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58344712,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570813325,"creation_date":1570808541,"question_id":58344601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344601","body_markdown":"I have a string that can contain multiple spaces (and tabs) and also terminate with spaces (but it will never start with spaces).\r\n\r\nSomething like: `&quot;topo pippo    pluto   &quot;`\r\n\r\nI need to remove the spaces at the end and replace any remaining sequence of spaces with `~`.

have quite a few repositories in my app and we need REST endpoints for them. Due to certain requirements, the default implementation of spring-data-rest is not effective and thus I wanted to write my own implementation. Initially I started by writing a controller for each of my entity like thus:\r\n\r\n    @RepositoryRestController\r\n    @RequestMapping(&quot;/myEntity&quot;)\r\n    @ExposesResourceFor(MyEntity.class)\r\n    public class MyEntityResource {\r\n        @GetMapping(value = &quot;&quot;, produces = MediaTypes.HAL_JSON_VALUE)\r\n        public ResponseEntity getResult(@RequestParam final MultiValueMap&lt;String, String&gt; parameters) throws IllegalAccessException {\r\n            // my logic\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWriting this boiler code for all the rest endpoints associated with the repositories seems like a lot of work and thus I was thinking of writing a generic controller for all repositories taking ideas from `RepositoryEntityController`. So I created a controller like\r\n\r\n    @RepositoryRestController\r\n    public class ApiResource {\r\n    \r\n        @GetMapping(value = &quot;/{repository}&quot;, produces = MediaTypes.HAL_JSON_VALUE)\r\n        public ResponseEntity getResult(@QuerydslPredicate RootResourceInformation resourceInformation, @PathVariable String repository) throws IllegalAccessException {\r\n                // my logic\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is pretty much how `RepositoryEntityController#getCollectionResource` is defined but this throws a `Ambiguous handler methods mapped for &#39;/api/v1/personalAccessTokens&#39;` exception indicating my method and the `RepositoryEntityController#getCollectionResource` method.\r\n\r\nHow do I cleanly override the default implementation?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344599/ambiguous-handler-methods-when-trying-to-create-generic-rest-api-controllers","title":"Ambiguous handler methods when trying to create generic rest api controllers"},{"tags":["unity3d","mesh"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21209,"user_id":7111561,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SNnq7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"derHugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7111561/derhugo"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1570808696,"post_id":58344598,"comment_id":103044282,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344598/unity-3d-force-quads-instead-of-triangles-in-mesh#comment103044282_58344598"},{"owner":{"reputation":12907,"user_id":1663383,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3aaf8438a71124d393af5af486a7e78b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Draco18s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663383/draco18s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570814772,"post_id":58344598,"comment_id":103046872,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344598/unity-3d-force-quads-instead-of-triangles-in-mesh#comment103046872_58344598"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11237278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e194fb5aaaa2fae739b80aef2e14428?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vintoriez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11237278/vintoriez"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571313232,"post_id":58344598,"comment_id":103204523,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344598/unity-3d-force-quads-instead-of-triangles-in-mesh#comment103204523_58344598"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11237278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e194fb5aaaa2fae739b80aef2e14428?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vintoriez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11237278/vintoriez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11237278,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5e194fb5aaaa2fae739b80aef2e14428?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vintoriez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11237278/vintoriez"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570808595,"creation_date":1570808532,"last_edit_date":1570808595,"question_id":58344598,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344598","body_markdown":"Hi i am making video player in Unity that allows to move corners of the screen.

It&#39;s a `BootstrapError` not a standard error, so you&#39;ll want to look at the source-code for `django-bootstrap4` to see why it gets raised. Looking at the source code (just search) you&#39;ll find this:\r\n```\r\n        if not isinstance(form, BaseForm):\r\n            raise BootstrapError(&#39;Parameter &quot;form&quot; should contain a valid Django Form.&#39;)\r\n```\r\nTry and work through the code from where you call your template tag, to where this error is raised (looking at the traceback might also help you here) to understand what all the various variables are equal to.\r\n\r\nIn your case `form` will be equal to `user_profile_form`, and the error is being raised because `user_profile_form` is not an instance of `BaseForm` (imported from `django.forms.forms`). So you can go back and look at `user_profile_form`. Well it&#39;s an instance of `UserProfileForm` which is in turn a subclass of `ModelForm`. But `ModelForm` is a subclass of `BaseForm`. Hmmm... this seems a bit strange. Why is `user_profile_form` not an instance of `BaseForm` when it should be. \r\n\r\nAt this point, first check for things like spelling errors? Maybe check if your middleware could be playing with the form at all. Also, try simplifing things, just render the form `{{ user_profile_form }}`...  you would find this doesn&#39;t work. So the problem seems to be with `user_profile_form`?\r\n\r\nAha... we&#39;ve passed down `user_profile_form` to the template in the view, `SignUp`. **But that&#39;s not the view we&#39;re looking at here!!!** The view we&#39;re considering is the `UpdateAccounts` view. This is a `generic.UpdateView`, and if we check out the django docs (always a good idea) and look at the example we see the form is passed down to the template as just `form`.\r\n\r\nReplace the line:\r\n```\r\n      {% bootstrap_form user_profile_form layout=&#39;inline&#39; %}\r\n```\r\nwith\r\n```\r\n      {% bootstrap_form form layout=&#39;inline&#39; %}\r\n```\r\nIn the template `userprofile_form.html`, and it should all work swimmingly :)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I went down some blind alleys, before I stumbled across the (perhaps more obvious) correct solution. But I hope this is helpful.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344593/django-bootstrap-error-parameter-form-should-contain-a-valid-django-form/58423738#58423738","title":"Django / Bootstrap Error: Parameter &quot;form&quot; should contain a valid Django Form"}],"owner":{"reputation":23,"user_id":5196452,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6fc3c39d940cc433278e9fb26a03e054?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"R.

I use a classical symfony login form, with FOSUserBundle. The login pages works perfectly fine except for one user, who is using Internet Explorer (don&#39;t know which version) =&gt; he is the only user having this issue. Other users with Internet Explorer and using the same network did not have the issue at all.\r\n\r\nWhen this user types his credentials on the login page (mail + password) and clicks on the submit button, nothing happens. The form submits and then the user is on the login page once again with nothing happening.\r\n\r\nThis client is connecting from his company network. And when he tries to login using another browser (Firefox), everything works fine and the login functions.\r\n\r\nBesides, we tried to hard refresh the page on Internet Explorer with &quot;Ctrl + Shift + R&quot; on Windows, but it did not solve the problem.\r\n\r\nI tried to modify the Internet Options &gt; Privacy &gt; Select a Setting for Internet Zone &quot;High&quot; (which blocks all cookies from websites that  do not have a compact privacy policy) and managed to reproduce the same behavior on my computer.

However, the issue is that if I were to open up Task View, I would see that the activity was continuing within the browser task, and my app&#39;s task is left at a previous activity.\r\n\r\nI start the browser with:\r\n```\r\nval i = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)\r\ni.data = Uri.parse(authUrl)\r\nstartActivity(i)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich, eventually, leads to a redirect to my app with a custom scheme:\r\n```\r\n&lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.VIEW&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.DEFAULT&quot;/&gt;\r\n&lt;category android:name=&quot;android.intent.category.BROWSABLE&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;data android:host=&quot;callback&quot;\r\n      android:scheme=&quot;d2app&quot;\r\n      android:pathPattern=&quot;.*&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut as you could see [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/295883437938573313/632207667099598848/Screenshot_20191012-002715.jpg)\r\nthe browser remains the active task and the app proceeds within it.\r\n\r\nIs there a certain flag/set of flags I should be adding to the browser intent?

Those pairs that don&#39;t implement the photo capture are probably only about computer devices, but I&#39;m not 100% sure of that (maybe some browsers on computer devices do implement the photo capture, maybe some browsers on non-computer devices don&#39;t).\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make up for that lack on such devices, I use a library to have:\r\n\r\n - one ```input type=&quot;file&quot;``` to upload file from file-system, + for certain devices: to capture file from camera\r\n - one special button calling the library to capture photo\r\n\r\nThat library fulffils others tasks and is nicely integrated to my upload system. Also, I use it for a long time now, so to change it might introduce regressions. To conclude: I would prefer to keep it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for devices that allow the photo capture, that library performs less than the device photo capture. For example, it does not offer the possibility to switch between front and back cameras.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n**That&#39;s why, to capture photos, I need to use that library only for devices that don&#39;t implement the photo capture.**\r\n\r\n**In other words: I need to determine if a device implements or not the photo capture via ```input type=&quot;file&quot;```**\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nI found many many answers to determine if the browser is mobile or not, but no one is satisfying.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting thread was: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51273828/how-to-test-if-the-browser-support-input-capture.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that solution is not perfect: it&#39;s not because the &quot;capture&quot; property is not available for an input element, that the browser and the device does not offer the possibility to capture a photo via the input element.\r\n\r\nIt only means that it&#39;s not possible to force capturing a photo from the camera instead of uploading a file from the filesystem. But it does not mean the capture from the camera is not possible.\r\nHowever, after reading documentations I found it&#39;s highly related...\r\n\r\n...but after some tests, I found a counter-exemple: on a Samsung tablet, Firefox tells me the &quot;capture&quot; property is not available for input, but the browser offers to capture a photo via the input element after all.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAny help? :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344550/js-for-input-type-file-determine-if-the-device-offers-or-not-to-capture-a","title":"(JS) For &lt;input type=&quot;file&quot;&gt;, determine if the device offers or not to capture a photo from the camera"},{"tags":["c#","proxy","httpwebrequest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1806,"user_id":12046148,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/039c7e7445eb52d65ba41f7ecdf27e04?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Oleg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12046148/oleg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570808526,"post_id":58344549,"comment_id":103044197,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344549/how-to-use-proxy-credentials-with-static-ip#comment103044197_58344549"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11644350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1778171258996315/picture?type=large","display_name":"Hristo Ivanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11644350/hristo-ivanov"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570808371,"creation_date":1570808371,"question_id":58344549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344549","body_markdown":"I want to set proxy credentials to the `httpwebreqiest` so I have username like \r\n\r\nlum-customer-hl_e136b28a-zone-zone1\r\n\r\nAnd password like\r\n\r\noue1gg2oov3b\r\n\r\nAnd Ip `158.46.169.24`\r\nSo how to set up with httpwebrequest to get response.\r\n\r\n    myhttpwebreuqest.Proxy=???","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344549/how-to-use-proxy-credentials-with-static-ip","title":"How to use proxy credentials with static Ip"},{"tags":["php","validation","cakephp","cakephp-2.x"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2265,"user_id":1309690,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a8c0c658a0d6465fe9d2fbd46e9de62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ascsoftw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1309690/ascsoftw"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":29,"user_id":8521316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1691475664219246/picture?type=large","display_name":"Младен Карић","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8521316/%d0%9c%d0%bb%d0%b0%d0%b4%d0%b5%d0%bd-%d0%9a%d0%b0%d1%80%d0%b8%d1%9b"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571038228,"post_id":58360678,"comment_id":103093333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344548/cakephp-validating-model-always-true-but-error-messages-are-still-showing/58360678#comment103093333_58360678"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2265,"user_id":1309690,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a8c0c658a0d6465fe9d2fbd46e9de62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ascsoftw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1309690/ascsoftw"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570942120,"creation_date":1570942120,"answer_id":58360678,"question_id":58344548,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58360678","body_markdown":"This is happening because you are setting the data to validate using `set` method, but in the next line you are calling `create`.

code program in both windows and linux?\r\n- What can I try to compiling the program in order to do the program running in windows system?

There is no `T` at runtime.  Instead, you&#39;ll have to pass an actual string value to the `get()` method.\r\n\r\nYou can get some intelligent typing if you make a mapping from entity name as passed to `doRequest()` to the entity type.  For example:\r\n\r\n    interface EntityMap {\r\n        JobView: JobView;\r\n        OtherEntity: OtherEntity;\r\n        EtCetera: EtCetera;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThere don&#39;t need to be any objects of type `EntityMap` at runtime; it&#39;s just a helper type that the compiler uses to understand that the name e.g., `&quot;JobView&quot;` corresponds to the type `JobView`.  Mapping from names to types is something interfaces do well, so that&#39;s why we&#39;re using it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThen, your `get()` method might look like this:\r\n\r\n    public get&lt;K extends keyof EntityMap&gt;(entityName: K) {\r\n        const response = super.doRequest(&quot;/api/fetch/&quot; + entityName + &quot;/123&quot;);\r\n        return response as EntityMap[K];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo you are passing in an `entityName` parameter of generic type `K` that must match `keyof EntityMap`... namely `&quot;JobView&quot;`, `&quot;OtherEntity&quot;`, or `&quot;EtCetera&quot;`.  So now at runtime, the value `entityName` can be used to call `doRequest()`.  Then the response will be returned as type `EntityMap[K]`, where we [look up](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-2-1.html#keyof-and-lookup-types) the `K`-named property in `EntityMap`.  So you can use it like this:\r\n\r\n    const r = new RequestyThing();\r\n    const jv = r.get(&quot;JobView&quot;);\r\n    // const jv: JobView\r\n\r\nand you&#39;ll see that when you call `r.get(&quot;JobView&quot;)`, the compiler returns a value of type `JobView`.  \r\n\r\nHope that helps.  Good luck!\r\n\r\n[Link to

I&#39;ll eventually want to click through plotting each time to see the changes over time (like a plotting GUI). I need to pull out the selected columns based on time and index name for each set of timestamps.

issue seems to be here:\r\n\r\nYou forgot to rescale `1/255.` when you open the images for prediction in:\r\n\r\n``` python\r\n.....\r\nimg = cv2.imread(os.path.join(testing_dir, img_file))\r\nimg_resized = cv2.resize(img, (image_size, image_size), interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA)\r\nimg1 = np.reshape(img_resized, \r\n                  (1, img_resized.shape[0], img_resized.shape[1], img_resized.shape[2]))\r\n\r\n#you will probably need:\r\nimg1 = img1/255.\r\n\r\npred_class_num = model.predict_classes(img1)\r\n...........\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, notice that `cv2` will open images in `BGR` format, while Keras may be opening them in `RGB`.\r\n\r\n- Get images from the Keras generator    \r\n- Get images opened by you   \r\n- Plot these images to check if they look ok (or at least the same, if everything is BGR, it&#39;s not a problem although all plots will look funny)\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n    keras_train = train_generator[0][0] #first image from first batch\r\n    keras_val = validation_generator[0][0]\r\n\r\n    img = cv2.imread(os.path.join(testing_dir, img_file))\r\n    img_resized = cv2.resize(img, (image_size, image_size), interpolation = cv2.INTER_AREA) \r\n    img1 = np.reshape(img_resized, \r\n                      (1, img_resized.shape[0], img_resized.shape[1], img_resized.shape[2]))    \r\n    your_image = img1[0]/255. #first image from your batch rescaled \r\n\r\nPlot these images with `matplotlib`.    \r\nAlso make sure they have the same range:\r\n\r\n    plt.imshow(keras_train)\r\n    plt.plot()\r\n    plt.imshow(keras_val)\r\n    plt.plot()\r\n    plt.imshow(your_image)\r\n    plt.plot()\r\n    print(keras_train.max(), keras_val.max(), img1.max())\r\n\r\nYou may need to use `np.flip(images, axis=-1)` to transform BGR into RGB.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Hints for importing keras models\r\n\r\nIf you imported base model from keras, you should import the preprocessing from the same module, as well as use Keras image opener. This would eliminate possible mismatches:\r\n\r\n    from keras.applications.resnet50 import ResNet50\r\n    from keras.preprocessing import image #use this instead of cv2   \r\n    from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input #use this in the generators    \r\n\r\nIn both generators, use the preprocessing function:\r\n\r\n    #no rescale, only preprocessing function\r\n    train_datagen = keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator(\r\n                                   rotation_range=15,\r\n                                   width_shift_range=0.1,\r\n                                   height_shift_range=0.1,\r\n                                   shear_range=0.01,\r\n                                   zoom_range=[0.9, 1.25],\r\n                                   horizontal_flip=False,\r\n                                   vertical_flip=False,\r\n                                   fill_mode=&#39;reflect&#39;,\r\n                                   data_format=&#39;channels_last&#39;,\r\n                                   brightness_range=[0.5, 1.5],\r\n                                   preprocessing_function=preprocess_input)\r\n    validation_datagen = keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator(\r\n                                   preprocessing_function=preprocess_input)\r\n\r\nLoad and preprocess your images for prediction:\r\n\r\n    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(image_size,image_size))\r\n    x = image.img_to_array(img)\r\n    x = np.expand_dims(x, axis=0)\r\n    x = preprocess_input(x)\r\n\r\nMore in: https://keras.io/applications/\r\n\r\n\r\n#Other possibilities\r\n\r\nBut there could be several other things like:\r\n\r\n- Very strong overfitting, your patience for the early stopper is 100! Usually this is a very high number. But the only way to confirm this is to check whether the val_acc is rising too much compared with the best one.\r\n    - Suggestion: reload the best model saved by `ModelCheckpoint` before you start predicting    \r\n    - Suggestion: post the acc history so we can see whether it&#39;s bad    \r\n- Does the base model have `BatchNormalization` layers? - When you freeze a batch normalization layer, it will keep the `moving_mean` and `moving_variance` unchanged, but these values were trained with a different data. If your data doesn&#39;t have the same mean and variance, your model will train well, but validation will be a disaster    \r\n    - Suggestion: see whether the validation loss/acc is terribly wrong since the beginning    \r\n    - Suggestion: don&#39;t freeze the `BatchNormalization` layers in the base model (iterate over the layers and freeze only the other types)    \r\n    - Suggestion: if you happen to know the database with which the base model was trained, compare your data mean and variation with that database&#39;s mean and variation (treat each channel individually)   ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344477/keras-image-classification-high-accuracy-shown-but-low-on-test-images/58392540#58392540","title":"Keras image classification: High accuracy shown but low on test images"}],"owner":{"reputation":109,"user_id":4146344,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001662120748/picture?type=large","display_name":"Dang Manh Truong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4146344/dang-manh-truong"},"last_editor":{"reputation":109,"user_id":4146344,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001662120748/picture?type=large","display_name":"Dang Manh Truong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4146344/dang-manh-truong"},"comment_count":9,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":113,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58392540,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571152510,"creation_date":1570808061,"last_edit_date":1571152510,"question_id":58344477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344477","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to do some image classification on the Caltech101 dataset.

@chuklore for your answer, Besides allowing me to learn a new ES6&#39;s practice, you helped me move forward with my problem. But I am still facing an issue after I have implemented your recommandation. \r\n\r\nNow, I am able to get images separated from each other : i.ibb.co/n8TbdhM/image.png \r\n\r\nSo when I loop with PUG, I get three images as wanted BUT it always the same image : i.ibb.co/BTDPWN5/image.png \r\n\r\nAs you can see in the above screenshot, I am looping via PUG through what should have been three different images.\r\n\r\nWhen I check those images in my memory storage, it&#39;s indeed the same image with different UUID.\r\n\r\nSo something must have gone wrong in my code but I cannot figure it out. When in console.log(imgDetails.buffer), I get three different buffer, not always the same. So I don&#39;t know where the issue is coming from :\r\n\r\nconsole.log(imgDetails.buffer) : https://i.ibb.co/XVFzz4x/image.png\r\n\r\nHere is my code again : \r\n\r\n```\r\nexports.images = async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n    // get all images details\r\n    const imgArray = req.files;\r\n    // get extension (pgn, jpeg...)\r\n    const imgFormat = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        imgFormat.push(imgArray[i].mimetype.split(&#39;/&#39;)[1] );\r\n    }\r\n    // get unique ID by image\r\n    req.body.photo = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        req.body.photo.push(`${uuid.v4()}.${imgFormat[i]}`);\r\n    }\r\n    // unpack images from the array\r\n    let [imageOne, imageTwo, imageThree] = req.body.photo;\r\n\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++) {\r\n        const imgDetails = imgArray[i];\r\n        // get buffer for each image\r\n        const photo = await jimp.read(imgDetails.buffer);\r\n        await photo.resize(600, jimp.AUTO);\r\n        await photo.write(`./public/uploads/${(imageOne)}`);\r\n        await photo.write(`./public/uploads/${(imageTwo)}`);\r\n        await photo.write(`./public/uploads/${(imageThree)}`)\r\n    }\r\n    next();\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\nI can provide details about the rest of my code if needed.

Thanks a lot for your help,\r\nI managed to get it worked by following your valuable instructions and add up small modifications.

Because assuming that I want 50 images on my website, I cannot duplicate 50 times each line. \r\n\r\nAlso, when I upload just one image (instead of three), I end up with a &quot;Cannot read property &#39;mimetype&#39; of undefined&quot;. Obviously, uploading three images is mandatory, but I don&#39;t want it to be so. \r\n\r\nI have tried many things like : \r\n\r\n```\r\n    for(let i=0; i &lt; req.files.length; i++ ) {\r\n        if( typeof req.files[i].mimetype ===&#39;undefined&#39;) {\r\n\t\t// ...\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing works so far. Any idea ? \r\nThanks\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344471/issues-when-trying-to-upload-multiple-images-from-multer-using-jimp-express-in/58380559#58380559","title":"Issues when trying to upload multiple images from Multer using Jimp (Express) in NodeJS"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11358916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/555606f085ccd0b79d392fd9bf6f45d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Said951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11358916/said951"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571144561,"creation_date":1571144561,"answer_id":58395390,"question_id":58344471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58395390","body_markdown":"For those who are interested, here is my final code that resolved all issues mentionned above : \r\n\r\n```\r\nexports.images = async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n    const imgArray = req.files;\r\n\r\n    const imgFormat = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        imgFormat.push(imgArray[i].mimetype.split(&#39;/&#39;)[1] );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    req.body.photo = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        req.body.photo.push(`${uuid.v4()}.${imgFormat[i]}`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++) {\r\n        const imgDetails = imgArray[i];\r\n        const photo = await jimp.read(imgDetails.buffer);\r\n        await photo.resize(1200, jimp.AUTO);\r\n        await photo.write(`./public/uploads/${(req.body.photo[i])}`)\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    next();\r\n    \r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this code, i am able to upload multiple images via multer and jimp.\r\nMany thanks to @ for your help","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344471/issues-when-trying-to-upload-multiple-images-from-multer-using-jimp-express-in/58395390#58395390","title":"Issues when trying to upload multiple images from Multer using Jimp (Express) in NodeJS"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11358916,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/555606f085ccd0b79d392fd9bf6f45d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Said951","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11358916/said951"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58395390,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571144561,"creation_date":1570808037,"question_id":58344471,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344471","body_markdown":"I want to display multiple images on my website, using Multer (nodejs). \r\n\r\nI have created the following function : \r\n\r\n```\r\nexports.upload = multer(options).array(&#39;photo&#39;,3);\r\n\r\nexports.images = async (req, res, next) =&gt; {\r\n    const imgArray = req.files;\r\n\r\n    const imgFormat = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        imgFormat.push(imgArray[i].mimetype.split(&#39;/&#39;)[1] );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    req.body.photo = [];\r\n    for(let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++ ) {\r\n        req.body.photo.push(`${uuid.v4()}.${imgFormat[i]}`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; imgArray.length; i++) {\r\n        const imgDetails = imgArray[i];\r\n        const photo = await jimp.read(imgDetails.buffer);\r\n        await photo.resize(1200, jimp.AUTO);\r\n        await photo.write(`./public/uploads/${(req.body.photo)}`)\r\n    }\r\n    next();\r\n    console.log(req.body.photo);\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use mongoose to access my database.

But when I drag an event, it only gets sent once.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what my controller looks like.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic function update(Request $request, $id)\r\n{\r\n    Task::find($id)-&gt;update([\r\n        &#39;date_from&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;date_from,\r\n        &#39;date_until&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;date_until,\r\n        &#39;time_from&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;time_from,\r\n        &#39;time_until&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;time_until,\r\n        &#39;title&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;title,\r\n        &#39;description&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;description\r\n    ]);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this is the really weird part. \r\n\r\nSometimes, the event does get updated, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.\r\n\r\n1/10 it doesn&#39;t, and if I go really fast, 3/10 times it doesn&#39;t update.\r\n\r\nMy Ajax requests sometimes take up to 1.6 seconds with a return but a normal one takes about 900ms (still very long).\r\n\r\nhttps://pastebin.com/cUh5Dy9z a very long uninteresting pastebin if you need to go over it more specifically.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344440/fullcalendar-ajax-request-gets-sent-twice-sometimes-unsuccessfull","title":"FULLCALENDAR Ajax request gets sent twice, sometimes unsuccessfull"},{"tags":["php","smarty","prestashop-1.7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13000,"user_id":1827600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KHa84.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"suspectus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1827600/suspectus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570808155,"post_id":58344439,"comment_id":103044000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344439/how-can-i-use-login-form-a-variable-in-header-tpl-whatever-the-page#comment103044000_58344439"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11869637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10219454788938540/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tristan Florin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869637/tristan-florin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13000,"user_id":1827600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KHa84.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"suspectus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1827600/suspectus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570808510,"post_id":58344439,"comment_id":103044188,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344439/how-can-i-use-login-form-a-variable-in-header-tpl-whatever-the-page#comment103044188_58344439"},{"owner":{"reputation":13000,"user_id":1827600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KHa84.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"suspectus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1827600/suspectus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570810326,"post_id":58344439,"comment_id":103045038,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344439/how-can-i-use-login-form-a-variable-in-header-tpl-whatever-the-page#comment103045038_58344439"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11869637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10219454788938540/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tristan Florin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869637/tristan-florin"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13000,"user_id":1827600,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KHa84.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"suspectus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1827600/suspectus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571044822,"post_id":58344439,"comment_id":103096577,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58344439/how-can-i-use-login-form-a-variable-in-header-tpl-whatever-the-page#comment103096577_58344439"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11869637,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10219454788938540/picture?type=large","display_name":"Tristan Florin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11869637/tristan-florin"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570807892,"creation_date":1570807892,"question_id":58344439,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58344439","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to set a login form in a popin include in the header.tpl file.\r\n\r\nWhen I&#39;m on the authentication page, it works fine.

pd.DataFrame(data, columns=[&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;])\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe DataFrame looks like this:\r\n\r\n````python\r\n          A         B

to divide certain columns for example with 2. In this case I&#39;d like to divide column B, D, and E with two. For that I&#39;d like to use a list. Becaus in my real Problem the Indices are Equity-names and the ones I&#39;d like to divide are saved in a list.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what I tried:\r\n\r\n`````python\r\nlist = [&quot;B&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot;]\r\ndf1 = df[df.columns.intersection(list)] *0.5\r\nprint(df1)\r\n`````\r\nAnd the result looks like this:\r\n`````python\r\n          B         D         E\r\n0  0.092038  0.086899  0.092297\r\n1  0.283759  0.047058  0.025392\r\n2  0.377484  0.355152  0.054702\r\n3  0.308971  0.021517  0.399164\r\n4  0.230749  0.310682  0.487341\r\n5  0.411212  0.317453  0.070046\r\n`````\r\nBut what I get is only a DataFrame which only contains the columns from the list. I&#39;d like that my result would contain the new calculated value plus the old values from the columns which weren&#39;t in the list.\r\n\r\nThe result should look like this:\r\n````python\r\n          A         B         C         D         E\r\n0  0.736739  0.092038  0.727951  0.086899  0.092297\r\n1  0.047031  0.283759  0.103112  0.047058  0.025392\r\n2  0.955045  0.377484  0.235842  0.355152
