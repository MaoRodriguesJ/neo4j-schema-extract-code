I am not permitted to mix arithmetic and Boolean/bitwise operators, I must use only one type of operator in my answer.\r\n\r\nA partner and I have attempted to trace through the logic of the ALU to develop the expression. However, we are confused as to the meaning of &quot;negate B.&quot; Does this mean that we flip all the bits in B, or does it mean that we flip all the bits in B and then add 1 to the result? If I try an example with the latter case, for example, if A = 0110 and B = 0001, then: Invert A = 1001, Negate B = 1111. \r\n\r\n    Result 0: 1 + 1 = 0, carry-out = 1\r\n    \r\n    Result 1: 0 + 1 + (carry-in = 1) = 0, carry-out = 1\r\n    \r\n    Result 2: 0 + 1 + (carry-in = 1) = 0, carry-out = 1\r\n    \r\n    Result 3: 1 + 1 + (carry-in = 1) = 1, carry-out 1 \r\n\r\nThus, the final result would be 1000 = -8. Since we are confused as to the meaning of &quot;negate B&quot; we aren&#39;t sure if this is even the correct result for this example. If we are correct, then the expression using only arithmetic operators would be ~A + (~B + 1) = (-A - 1) + (-B). We have tested our expression with a couple other examples and found that it works. Is our expression correct, or have we misunderstood the definition of &quot;negate&quot;/the logic of the ALU?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170342/what-is-the-output-of-a-4-bit-alu-when-invert-a-1-negate-b-1-and-operation","title":"What is the output of a 4-bit ALU when Invert A = 1, Negate B = 1, and Operation ID = 10?"},{"tags":["spring-integration","spring-jms","mq","jms-topic"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6414,"user_id":7264620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbebce2451f4d9f7abdebb6b2db7b618?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JoshMc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7264620/joshmc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569857453,"post_id":58170341,"comment_id":102723125,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170341/outbound-channel-adapter-spring-jms-starting-too-many-mq-connections#comment102723125_58170341"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6422769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Yk7_0P3G4pM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABOQ/L8BbNqL5lMM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ramneek Handa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6422769/ramneek-handa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6414,"user_id":7264620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbebce2451f4d9f7abdebb6b2db7b618?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JoshMc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7264620/joshmc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570151167,"post_id":58170341,"comment_id":102832071,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170341/outbound-channel-adapter-spring-jms-starting-too-many-mq-connections#comment102832071_58170341"},{"owner":{"reputation":6414,"user_id":7264620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbebce2451f4d9f7abdebb6b2db7b618?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JoshMc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7264620/joshmc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570153150,"post_id":58170341,"comment_id":102832436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170341/outbound-channel-adapter-spring-jms-starting-too-many-mq-connections#comment102832436_58170341"},{"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6422769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Yk7_0P3G4pM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABOQ/L8BbNqL5lMM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ramneek Handa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6422769/ramneek-handa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6414,"user_id":7264620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bbebce2451f4d9f7abdebb6b2db7b618?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JoshMc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7264620/joshmc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570157722,"post_id":58170341,"comment_id":102833218,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170341/outbound-channel-adapter-spring-jms-starting-too-many-mq-connections#comment102833218_58170341"}],"owner":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6422769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Yk7_0P3G4pM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABOQ/L8BbNqL5lMM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ramneek Handa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6422769/ramneek-handa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12,"user_id":6422769,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Yk7_0P3G4pM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABOQ/L8BbNqL5lMM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ramneek Handa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6422769/ramneek-handa"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570151987,"creation_date":1569854971,"last_edit_date":1570151987,"question_id":58170341,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58170341","body_markdown":"I am using jms:outbound-channel-adapter. \r\nWe noticed that application server is starting way too many MQ connections.

immediately after sending the 101\r\n   (Switching Protocols) response, the server is expected to continue\r\n   responding to the original request as if it had received its\r\n   equivalent within the new protocol (i.e., the server still has an\r\n   outstanding request to satisfy after the protocol has been changed,\r\n   and is expected to do so without requiring the request to be\r\n   repeated).\r\n\r\n&gt; If the Upgrade header field is received in a GET request\r\n   and the server decides to switch protocols, it first responds with a\r\n   101 (Switching Protocols) message in HTTP/1.1 and **then immediately\r\n   follows that with the new protocol&#39;s equivalent of a response to a\r\n   GET on the target resource**.  This allows a connection to be upgraded\r\n   to protocols with the same semantics as HTTP without the latency cost\r\n   of an additional round trip.\r\n\r\nI have made my interceptors(Using OkHttp) as follows\r\n\r\n    public class H2cUpgradeRequestInterceptor implements Interceptor {\r\n    private static final Log logger = LogFactory.getLog(H2cUpgradeRequestInterceptor.class);\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Response intercept(Chain chain) throws IOException {\r\n        Request request = chain.request();\r\n        Request upgradeRequest = request.newBuilder().addHeader(&quot;Connection&quot;, &quot;Upgrade, HTTP2-Settings&quot;)\r\n                .addHeader(&quot;Upgrade&quot;, &quot;h2c&quot;).addHeader(&quot;HTTP2-Settings&quot;, &quot;AAMAAABkAARAAAAAAAIAAAAA&quot;).build();\r\n        Response upgradeResponse = chain.proceed(upgradeRequest);\r\n        if (upgradeResponse != null &amp;&amp; upgradeResponse.code() == HttpStatus.SC_SWITCHING_PROTOCOLS) {\r\n            logger.debug(&quot;Switching Protocols success&quot;); // Success. Got 101 in reply.\r\n        }\r\n        upgradeResponse.body(); // returns null\r\n        // I am clueless on how to read the response hereafter.\r\n        // As per the docs, the 101 status code reply will be followed by a data stream. How can I access this?\r\n        return upgradeResponse;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo basically, for a single request.

So I manually added that information to the request, and it worked as expected.  So somehow, in my setup, the autoquery operations that are called locally, the db connection info is not getting added to the request object.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170325/autoquery-is-not-getting-the-name-db-connection-when-run-through-gateway","title":"AutoQuery is not getting the name db connection when run through gateway"},{"tags":["android","google-maps"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3736,"user_id":3166846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QoxDC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dharms","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166846/dharms"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569861000,"post_id":58170319,"comment_id":102724697,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170319/google-maps-custom-tile-overlay#comment102724697_58170319"},{"owner":{"reputation":1088,"user_id":1815054,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0b2bada471cd230912c79bb4f1691a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dusan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1815054/dusan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3736,"user_id":3166846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QoxDC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dharms","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166846/dharms"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569861502,"post_id":58170319,"comment_id":102724905,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170319/google-maps-custom-tile-overlay#comment102724905_58170319"},{"owner":{"reputation":3736,"user_id":3166846,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QoxDC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dharms","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3166846/dharms"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569862781,"post_id":58170319,"comment_id":102725404,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170319/google-maps-custom-tile-overlay#comment102725404_58170319"}],"owner":{"reputation":1088,"user_id":1815054,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0b2bada471cd230912c79bb4f1691a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dusan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1815054/dusan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2848,"user_id":2217859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vnucx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Claudio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2217859/claudio"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570102391,"creation_date":1569854896,"last_edit_date":1570102391,"question_id":58170319,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58170319","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to place an Overlay Layer on my Google Maps in Android.\r\nAccording to the documentation I have to use a TileProvider, which is fine, but the  getTileUrl() function returns an URL, which holds and address to a image tile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to overlay just a semi-transparent square.

Your code doesn&#39;t wait for the promises within the loop to resolve.\r\n\r\nIf you want to wait for them *in series* (one after another, each waiting for the previous one), then since you mentioned using an `async` function and `await`, you just write it in standard logical flow, awaiting each promise:\r\n\r\n    async function addImagesToCanvas(urls){\r\n        for (url of urls) {\r\n           const img_element = await loadImage(url);\r\n           addImageToCanvas(img_element);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nor of course:\r\n\r\n    async function addImagesToCanvas(urls){\r\n        for (url of urls) {\r\n           addImageToCanvas(await loadImage(url));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you want to let them all process in parallel and wait for the result, use `map` to get an aaray of the promises and return the promise created by `Promise.all` and return its promise:\r\n\r\n    function addImagesToCanvas(urls){\r\n        return Promise.all(urls.map(url =&gt; loadImage(url).then(addImageToCanvas)));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOr alternately:\r\n\r\n    function addImagesToCanvas(urls){\r\n        return Promise.all(urls.map(async (url) =&gt; {\r\n            addImageToCanvas(await loadImage(url);\r\n        }));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNo need for the function itself to be `async`, since it can directly return the promise from `Promise.all`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSide note: Your code seems to be falling prey to what I call [*The Horror of Implicit Globals*](http://blog.niftysnippets.org/2008/03/horror-of-implicit-globals.html).

am trying to figure out how to use `self` in `PandasUDF.GroupBy.Apply` in a Class method in Python and also pass arguments in it. I have tried a lot of different ways to make it work but couldn&#39;t make it work. I also searched the internet extensively looking for an example of PandasUDF which is used inside a class with self and arguments but could not find anything like that. I know how to do all of the before mentioned things with `Pandas.GroupBy.Apply` but when i apply the same logic in `PandasUDF.GroupBy.Apply`, it does not work.\r\n\r\nThe only way through which i could make it work was by declaring it static-method \r\n```\r\nclass Train:\r\n    return_type = StructType([\r\n        StructField(&quot;div_nbr&quot;, FloatType()),\r\n        StructField(&quot;store_nbr&quot;, FloatType()),\r\n        StructField(&quot;model_str&quot;, BinaryType())\r\n    ])\r\n    function_type = PandasUDFType.GROUPED_MAP\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n       ............\r\n\r\n    def run_train(self):\r\n         output = sp_df.groupby([&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;]).apply(self.model_train)\r\n         output.show(10)\r\n\r\n    @staticmethod\r\n    @pandas_udf(return_type, function_type)\r\n    def model_train(pd_df):\r\n        features_name = [&#39;days_into_year&#39;, &#39;months_into_year&#39;, &#39;minutes_into_day&#39;, &#39;hour_of_day&#39;, &#39;recency&#39;]\r\n\r\n        X = pd_df[features_name].copy()\r\n        Y = pd.DataFrame(pd_df[&#39;trans_type_value&#39;]).copy()\r\n\r\n        estimator_1 = XGBRegressor(max_depth=3, learning_rate=0.1, n_estimators=300, verbosity=1,\r\n                                   objective=&#39;reg:squarederror&#39;, booster=&#39;gbtree&#39;, n_jobs=-1, gamma=0,\r\n                                   min_child_weight=5, max_delta_step=0, subsample=0.6, colsample_bytree=0.8,\r\n                                   colsample_bylevel=1, colsample_bynode=1, reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1,\r\n                                   scale_pos_weight=1, base_score=0.5, random_state=1234, missing=None,\r\n                                   importance_type=&#39;gain&#39;)\r\n        estimator_1.fit(X, Y)\r\n        df_to_return = pd_df[[&#39;div_nbr&#39;, &#39;store_nbr&#39;]].drop_duplicates().copy()\r\n        df_to_return[&#39;model_str&#39;] = pickle.dumps(estimator_1)\r\n\r\n        return df_to_return\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat i would like to achieve in reality is that declare `return_type` and `function_type`, `features_name ` in `__init__()`, then use it in PandasUDF, also pass parameters to be used inside the function when doing `Pandas.GroupBy.Apply`\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help me out, I would highly appreciate that.

So if I have a table I&#39;m expecting to have 42 rows, it&#39;s completing 168 iterations.

Let me give a twist to your question, as it&#39;s about replacing NAs, but I think with this code you should avoid that problem. \r\n\r\nAs I read your code, you erase the strings &quot;D_0__&quot;, &quot;D_1__&quot;, ... from the observation strings. Then you replace the strings &quot;Ambiguous_taxa&quot;, &quot;unidentified&quot;, ... with the string &quot;Undefined&quot;.\r\n\r\nAccording to your data, I replaced the functions with regex, which makes a little easy to clean your data:\r\n\r\n    library(tidyverse)\r\n    taxon_import &lt;- function(data) { \r\n    data &lt;- as.data.frame(str_split_fixed(data$Taxon, &quot;;&quot;, 7))\r\n    colnames(data) &lt;- c(&quot;Domain&quot;, &quot;Phylum&quot;, &quot;Class&quot;, &quot;Order&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Genus&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;)\r\n    return(data)\r\n    }\r\n    raw_data_1 &lt;- taxon_import(read.delim(&quot;taxonomy.tsv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\r\n    raw_data_1 &lt;- data.frame(lapply(raw_data_1,as.character),stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n    depured &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(raw_data_1,function(x) sub(&quot;^D_[0-6]__&quot;,&quot;&quot;,x)), stringAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n    depured &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(depured,function(x) sub(&quot;__|unidentified|Ambiguous_taxa|uncultured&quot;,&quot;Undefined&quot;,x)), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n    depured &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(depured,function(x) sub(&quot;Unknown|uncultured\\\\s.\\\\*|Unassigned\\\\s.\\\\*&quot;,&quot;Undefined&quot;,x)), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n    depured &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(depured,function(x) sub(&quot;wastewater\\\\sUnassigned|metagenome&quot;,&quot;Undefined&quot;,x)), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)\r\n    depured[depured ==&quot;&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Undefined&quot;\r\n\r\nLet me explain my code. First, I read in many websites that it&#39;s better to avoid loops, as &quot;for&quot;. So how you replace text that starts with &quot;D_0__&quot;?\r\n\r\nThe answer is regex (regular expression). It seems complicated at first but with practice it&#39;ll be helpful. See this expression:\r\n\r\n    &quot;^D_[0-6]__&quot;\r\nIt means: &quot;Take the start of the string which begins with &quot;D_&quot; and follows a number between 0 and 6 and follows &quot;__&quot;\r\n\r\nAha. So you can use the function sub\r\n\r\n    sub(&quot;^D_[0-6]__&quot;,&quot;&quot;,string)\r\nwhich reads: replace the regular expression with a blank space &quot;&quot; in the string.\r\n\r\nNow you see another regex:\r\n \r\n    &quot;__|unidentified|Ambiguous_taxa|uncultured&quot;\r\n\r\nIt means: select the string &quot;__&quot; or &quot;unidentified&quot; or &quot;Ambiguous_taxa&quot; ...\r\n\r\nBe careful with this regex\r\n\r\n    &quot;Unknown|uncultured\\\\s.\\\\*|Unassigned\\\\s.\\\\*&quot;    \r\n\r\nit means: select the string &quot;Unknown&quot; or &quot;uncultured .*&quot; or...\r\n\r\nthe blank space it&#39;s represented by \\\\s and the asterisk is \\\\*\r\n\r\nNow what about the as.data.frame function? Every time I use it I have to make it &quot;stringsAsFactors = FALSE&quot; because the function tries to use the characters, as factors.\r\n\r\nWith this code no NA are created.\r\n\r\nHope it helps, please don&#39;t hesitate to ask if needed.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nAlexis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170230/replacing-na-cells-with-string-in-r-dataframe/58176858#58176858","title":"Replacing NA cells with string in R dataframe"}],"owner":{"reputation":180,"user_id":10001055,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10215200372461686/picture?type=large","display_name":"roelofco","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10001055/roelofco"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58176858,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569893978,"creation_date":1569854580,"question_id":58170230,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58170230","body_markdown":"I have written a function that &quot;cleans up&quot; taxonomic data from NGS taxonomic files.  The problem is that I am unable to replace NA cells with a string like &quot;undefined&quot;.  I know that it has something to do with variables being made into factors and not characters (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16819956/warning-message-in-invalid-factor-level-na-generated), however even when importing data with `stringsAsFactors = FALSE` I still get this error in some cells. \r\n\r\nHere is how I import the data:\r\n\r\n```\r\nraw_data_1 &lt;- taxon_import(read.delim(&quot;taxonomy_site_1/*/*/*/taxonomy.tsv&quot;, stringsAsFactors = FALSE))\r\n```\r\nThe `taxon_import` function is used to split the taxa and assign variable names:\r\n```\r\ntaxon_import &lt;- function(data) {\r\n  data &lt;- as.data.frame(str_split_fixed(data$Taxon, &quot;;&quot;, 7))\r\n  colnames(data) &lt;- c(&quot;Domain&quot;, &quot;Phylum&quot;, &quot;Class&quot;, &quot;Order&quot;, &quot;Family&quot;, &quot;Genus&quot;, &quot;Species&quot;)\r\n  return(data)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow the following function is used to &quot;clean&quot; the data and this is where I would like to replace certain strings with &quot;Undefined&quot;, however I keep getting the error: `In `[&lt;-.factor`(`*tmp*`, thisvar, value = &quot;Undefined&quot;) : invalid factor level, NA generated`\r\n\r\nHere follows the `data_cleanup` function:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndata_cleanup &lt;- function(data) {\r\n  strip_1 = list(&quot;D_0__&quot;, &quot;D_1__&quot;, &quot;D_2__&quot;, &quot;D_3__&quot;, &quot;D_4__&quot;, &quot;D_5__&quot;, &quot;D_6__&quot;)\r\n  for (i in strip_1) {\r\n    data &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(data, gsub, pattern = i, replacement = &quot;&quot;))\r\n  }\r\n  data[data==&quot;&quot;] &lt;- &quot;Undefined&quot;\r\n  strip_2 = list(&quot;__&quot;, &quot;unidentified&quot;, &quot;Ambiguous_taxa&quot;, &quot;uncultured&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot;, &quot;uncultured .*&quot;, &quot;Unassigned .*&quot;, &quot;wastewater Unassigned&quot;, &quot;metagenome&quot;)\r\n  for (j in strip_2) {\r\n    data &lt;- as.data.frame(sapply(data, gsub, pattern = j, replacement = &quot;Undefined&quot;))\r\n  }\r\n  return(data)\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe function is simply applied like: `test &lt;- data_cleanup(raw_data_1)`\r\n\r\nI am appending the data from a cloud, since it is very lengthy data.

A period of 3 days or 72 hours?\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM [#TABLE_1]\r\n    WHERE [rangetime] between DATEADD(hour,-63,DATEDIFF(d,0,GETDATE())) and  DATEADD(hour,9,DATEDIFF(d,0,GETDATE()))\r\n\r\n*output*\r\n\r\n    3 2019-09-27 21:30:00.000 \r\n    4 2019-09-28 09:30:00.000 \r\n    5 2019-09-28 21:30:00.000 \r\n    6 2019-09-29 09:30:00.000 \r\n    7 2019-09-29 21:30:00.000 \r\n    8 2019-09-30 07:30:00.000 \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170182/sql-server-get-rows-for-date-and-time-range/58172515#58172515","title":"SQL Server : get rows for date and time range"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11852412,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XCw9SOjSrg4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABw/m5WR_992oSs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joh Travell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11852412/joh-travell"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58172515,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569864117,"creation_date":1569854425,"last_edit_date":1569859831,"question_id":58170182,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58170182","body_markdown":"I have this table:\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[#TABLE_1]\r\n    (\r\n        [numreq] [INT] NULL,\r\n        [rangetime] [NVARCHAR](300) NULL\r\n    ) ON [PRIMARY]\r\n\r\n    INSERT INTO [dbo].[#TABLE_1] \r\n    VALUES (&#39;2&#39;, &#39;2019-09-27 07:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;3&#39;, &#39;2019-09-27 21:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;4&#39;, &#39;2019-09-28 09:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;5&#39;, &#39;2019-09-28 21:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;6&#39;, &#39;2019-09-29 09:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;7&#39;, &#39;2019-09-29 21:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;8&#39;, &#39;2019-09-30 07:30:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;9&#39;, &#39;2019-09-30 10:00:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;9&#39;, &#39;2019-09-30 11:00:00.000&#39;),\r\n           (&#39;9&#39;, &#39;2019-10-01 10:00:00.000&#39;)\r\n\r\nI want to select rows in a time span with 09:00 before 09:00.

I believe that this is not UB, because the pointer itself is not const and I&#39;m not modifying the &quot;foo&quot; object.\r\n\r\nThis is correct.  The pointer is not `const` so you can change it to point to something else if you want.  In this case it won&#39;t cause a meory leak but remember that if the pointer points to data allocated with `new` and it is the only pointer to that data then you need to call `delete` before reassigning the pointer otherwise you&#39;ll have a meory leak.\r\n\r\n&gt; Extra question: and removing the constness of pointer? Would be UB?\r\n\r\nIt is only UB if you try to modify a `const` object you removed `const` from, which you do in this case.  Just removing `const` is okay, and sometimes needed, but you are never allowed to modify the object unless it was not `const` to begin with.  For example the following is legal since `foo` is not `const`.\r\n\r\n\tint foo = 42;\r\n\t\r\n\tvoid bar(int const&amp; baz) { const_cast&lt;int&amp;&gt;(baz) = 21; }\r\n\t\r\n\tint main()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tbar(foo);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\non the other hand\r\n\r\n\tconst int foo = 42;\r\n\t\r\n\tvoid bar(int const&amp; baz) { const_cast&lt;int&amp;&gt;(baz) = 21; }\r\n\t\r\n\tint main()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tbar(foo);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\nis not legal as `foo` is `const`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170163/is-it-ub-to-modify-where-pointer-points-when-original-data-is-const/58170220#58170220","title":"Is it UB to Modify where pointer points, when original data is const?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":49929,"user_id":5245033,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6dbfd37ccb940fd2afcd49e966ad97e4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SergeyA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5245033/sergeya"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569854604,"creation_date":1569854604,"answer_id":58170236,"question_id":58170163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58170236","body_markdown":"The code in the first snippet is 100% correct.

Internally, the files are kept in an `org.w3c.dom.Document`. This makes it quite difficult to switch to a library that uses other XML classes. Most input files are encoded in UTF-8, and most of them also have a few wide characters in them (for example emojis). In the input files, these wide characters appear as-is. Using the emoji example again, I can open my input XML file and see the emoji there. This is the behaviour I want. Parsing the files into a `Document` via `DocumentBuilder` also works fine. I checked with `getTextContent` for a node with such characters that they still appear in this form.\r\n\r\nHowever, serializing this `Document` back to a a byte array and later file does not work as expected. The wide characters are replaced by character references. Those references are actually invalid (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11952289/serializing-supplementary-unicode-characters-into-xml-documents-with-java?noredirect=1). But that is not the problem I am facing. Also, there is another question on SO which I cannot find at the moment, which was about the serializer writing the wrong encoding into the preamble. This also does not affect me. What I really want is that the wide characters are *not* replaced by character references, just keps as UTF-8 bytes. Javadoc for `LSSerializer` says:\r\n\r\n&gt; Within the character data of a document (outside of markup), any\r\n&gt; characters that cannot be represented directly are replaced with\r\n&gt; character references.\r\n\r\nPlease correct me if I am wrong, but those characters should actually be representable directly in UTF-8 encoding. This is the code I use:\r\n\r\n    public void serializeXml(Document doc, OutputStream os) {\r\n        DOMImplementationRegistry reg = DOMImplementationRegistry.newInstance();\r\n        DOMImplementationLS impl = (DOMImplementationLS) reg.getDOMImplementation(&quot;LS&quot;);\r\n        LSSerializer ser = impl.createLSSerializer();\r\n        LSOutput out = impl.createLSOutput();\r\n        out.setEncoding(doc.getXmlEncoding() /* &quot;UTF-16&quot; */);\r\n        out.setNewLine(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n        out.setByteStream(os);\r\n        ser.write(doc, out);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd this is a version with `Transformer` which sadly has the same behaviour.\r\n\r\n    public void serializeXml(Document doc, OutputStream os) {\r\n        Transformer t = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer();\r\n        t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.METHOD, &quot;xml&quot;);\r\n        t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.ENCODING, doc.getXmlEncoding() /* &quot;UTF-16&quot; */);\r\n        t.transform(new DOMSource(doc), new StreamResult(os));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSetting the output encoding to `UTF-16` is a workaround. In this encoding, the characters are displayed as I want them to. However, since the application shuffles the data around quite a bit, also over the network, I&#39;d very much prefer to use UTF-8 when it makes sense (few to none wide characters) and use UTF-16 when the input file in already encoded as such, to save a few bytes. Is there a known solution to achieve this behaviour?\r\n\r\nPS: In another project, I am able to use JAXB. Marshalling the same documents works perfectly even with UTF-8.\r\n\r\nEdit: Writing the file is pretty straightforward and is not the culprit. One example would look like:\r\n\r\n    Files.write(Paths.get(filename), os.toByteArray());\r\n\r\nwhere `os` is the `OutputStream` written to in the code above.\r\n\r\nThis sample should produce the described behaviour.\r\n\r\n    &lt;Attributes&gt;\r\n      &lt;Map&gt;\r\n        &lt;entry key=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;&#128158;test&#128158;&quot;/&gt;\r\n      &lt;/Map&gt;\r\n    &lt;/Attributes&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58170148/lsserializer-should-not-create-character-references","title":"LSSerializer should not create character references"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7869}
