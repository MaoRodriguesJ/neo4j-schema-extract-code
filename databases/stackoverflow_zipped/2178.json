you use a core profile context (`GLFW_OPENGL_CORE_PROFILE`), the default [Vertex Array Object](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Array_Object) 0 is not valid further you&#39;ve to use [Vertex Buffer Object](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Buffer_Object).\r\n\r\nWhen [`glVertexAttribPointer`](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/html/glVertexAttribPointer.xhtml) is called, then the vertex array specification is stored in the state vector of the currently bound vertex array object. The buffer which is currently bound to the target `ARRAY_BUFFER` is associated to the attribute and the name (value) of the object is stored in the state vector of the VAO.  \r\nIn compatibility profile there exists the default vertex array object 0, which can be used at any time but this is not valid in a core profile context. Further it is not necessary  in a compatibility profile to use a VBO, the last parameter of `glVertexAttribPointer` can be a pointer to the vertex data.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution is to switch to a compatibility profile `GLFW_OPENGL_COMPAT_PROFILE`:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nglfwWindowHint(GLFW_OPENGL_PROFILE, GLFW_OPENGL_COMPAT_PROFILE);\r\n```   \r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t want to do that or your system doesn&#39;t provide that, then you&#39;ve to read about [Vertex Specification](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Specification#Vertex_Buffer_Object). Create a vertex buffer object a vertex array object before the program loop:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n// vertex buffer object\r\nGLuint vbo;\r\nglGenBuffers(1, &amp;vbo);\r\nglBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo);\r\nglBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(vertices), vertices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);\r\n\r\n// vertex array object\r\nGLuint vao;\r\nglGenVertexArrays(1, &amp;vao);\r\nglBindVertexArray(vao);\r\nglEnableVertexAttribArray(0);\r\nglBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, vbo); // this is not necessary, because &quot;vbo&quot; is still bound \r\nglVertexAttribPointer(param_Position, 3, GL_FLOAT, (GLboolean) false, 0, nullptr);\r\n\r\n// the following is not necessary, you can let them bound\r\nglBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, 0);\r\nglBindVertexArray(0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use it in the loop to draw the mesh:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nglBindVertexArray(vao);\r\nglDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 3);\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022707/glvertexattribpointer-raise-gl-invalid-operation-version-330/58022777#58022777","title":"glVertexAttribPointer raise GL_INVALID_OPERATION version 330"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":2361826,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/191c8149ff2ae2f3546b65fa0a862493?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"IPMan82","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2361826/ipman82"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":2361826,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/191c8149ff2ae2f3546b65fa0a862493?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"IPMan82","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2361826/ipman82"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58022777,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568968130,"creation_date":1568960056,"last_edit_date":1568961067,"question_id":58022707,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022707","body_markdown":"I am trying to simplify my example to show exact abnormal case.

This means you set it for each call to GenerateAnswer.\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re using the bots on Azure, you&#39;re going to have to edit the BotServices.cs file to account for the QnAMaker metadata, which is returned in the call to GenerateAnswer. In particular, you&#39;re going to have to add the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar qnaOptions = new QnAMakerOptions();\r\nvar metadata = new Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA.Metadata();\r\n\r\nmetadata.Name = Constants.MetadataName.Intent;\r\nmetadata.Value = topIntent;\r\n\r\nqnaOptions.StrictFilters = new Microsoft.Bot.Builder.AI.QnA.Metadata[] { metadata };\r\nqnaOptions.Top = Constants.DefaultTop;\r\nqnaOptions.ScoreThreshold = 0.5F;\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe important bits are `var metadata...` and `qnaOptions.ScoreThreshold = 0.5F;` The only sample that shows this in action is the following sample on the Botbuilder-Samples repo: [Support Bot in QnA Maker](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/qnamaker-support/csharp_dotnetcore). \r\n\r\nHOWEVER, two things to keep in mind if you decide to practice with this sample:\r\n1) it&#39;s in the experimental branch of the samples repo, which means there is no guarantee to perfect functionality.\r\n2) That sample show multiple different QnAMaker functionalities.

I tried the method mentioned to set the threshold in the call to generateanswer, but this will succeed only in giving you the default answer if the threshold wasn&#39;t reached, something like &quot;No answers were found for that query.&quot; In most cases you&#39;re not going to want that response for your users, and I find checking the confidence score *after* you receive the answer to be more useful.\r\n\r\nI am doing a check in the actual dialog and setting the outputActivity from there. Again, this is nodejs but you should be able to do the same thing in C#. Here is how I implemented it.\r\n\r\n```nodejs\r\n// Apply confidence filter\r\nif (qnaResult[0].score &gt; MINIMUM_SCORE) {\r\n    outputActivity = MessageFactory.text(qnaAnswer);\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    // If low confidence, send to social talk\r\n    var socialResult = await SocialTalkHelper.queryQnAService(query, oldState);\r\n    if (socialResult[0].score &gt; MINIMUM_SCORE) {\r\n        outputActivity = MessageFactory.text(socialResult[0].answer);\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        // If low confidence for social talk, use default answer\r\n        outputActivity = MessageFactory.text(defaultAnswer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve actually cascaded this to use a second QnA Maker call to an Enterprise Social Talk KB if my minimum score isn&#39;t met.

you have not provided enough code to work with, I will post the concept and hope you will be able to do it, also comment if you have any more doubts I&#39;m always open to help\r\n\r\n - So firstly you need to write a function that asynchronously fetches\r\n   the data - Which means it fetches the data without having the page to\r\n   reload.\r\n - So you need to write the PHP code in a PHP file instead of in the HTML page, for example,\r\n   cart.php or where ever you have written your query to fetch the count\r\n   of the cart from database.\r\n - Once you have done that then you need to write an AJAX call to the\r\n   button of Add to Cart,  So when you click on add to cart, it triggers\r\n   the ajax request and fetches the data from the backend which is\r\n   passed from your cart.php\r\n\r\nfor example , write this code inside your add to cart button\r\n\r\n    fetch(&quot;cart.php&quot;)\r\n    .then(res=&gt;res.json)\r\n    .then(res=&gt;{\r\n\r\n     //You will get the count here and just append it inside the tag where your count is displayed \r\n    \r\n    //For example :\r\n     count.innerHTML = res\r\n       })\r\n\r\n\r\nDon&#39;t forget to json_encode($count); in the PHP file so that you can receive the data in JSON

think your problem is you&#39;re getting the `sample/register` for both tests.\r\nPlease note the tests are not executed right away in a synchronous manner. You&#39;re registering them only (so passing a callback to the `it` method).\r\n\r\nYour preparing code is executed right away before any test is executed.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare the test scenario you need to use `beforeAll` function that is executed just before any test inside specific `describe`.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndescribe(&#39;GET Request&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n   let args;\r\n   beforeAll(() =&gt; {\r\n     // an object as you your case is to pass multiple argument\r\n     args = { url: `sample/all` } \r\n   })\r\n   testCase.validateResponseCode(&#39;get&#39;, () =&gt; args);\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the `args` are not passed by reference but only getter.\r\nYou need to apply some small change to the `validateResponseCode` so it calls the getter in order to get the `args` variable.\r\n```\r\nvalidateResponseCode(requestMethod, argsGetter) {\r\n  it(`RESPONSE CODE VALIDATION: (...) ${requestMethod}`, async () =&gt; {\r\n    // now, this returns the expected values.\r\n    const args = argsGetter(); \r\n    let response;\r\n    // (...)\r\n\r\n ```\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe other (a bit larger refactor) solution would be to use a function factory so you can create scoped `validateResponseCode` function like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst createScopedValidateResponse = (args) =&gt;\r\n  (method) =&gt; testCase.validateResponseCode(method, args);\r\n\r\n// usage\r\nconst validateResponseCode = createScopedValidateResponse({ url: &#39;url&#39; });\r\n\r\nvalidateResponseCode(&#39;get&#39;);\r\nvalidateResponseCode(&#39;post&#39;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022680/how-to-handle-javascript-bind-for-same-variable-which-have-different-values/58022877#58022877","title":"How to handle javascript bind for same variable which have different values?"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":11912038,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71b37bc952a96cd1ad5a1c313a159855?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"muthu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11912038/muthu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7279,"user_id":2071697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7d1ded508aa80214b01298b83562406?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"skyboyer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071697/skyboyer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568977557,"creation_date":1568959921,"last_edit_date":1568961378,"question_id":58022680,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022680","body_markdown":"I am using javascript bind to get a value of variable from one file to another file.

The following two expressions work in the exact same way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlocal a, b, c = ...\r\nlocal d, e, f = some_function()\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind though that this has some performance implications, so maybe don&#39;t use it in a function that gets called like 1000 times a second ;)\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nNote that this really doesn&#39;t apply just to &quot;functions&quot;. Functions are actually more of a syntax feature than anything else. Under the hood, Lua only knows of chunks, which are what both functions and `.lua` files get turned into. So, if you run a Lua script, the entire script gets turned into a chunk and is therefore no different than a function.\r\n\r\nIn terms of code, the difference is that with a function you can specify names for its arguments outside of its code, whereas with a file you&#39;re already at the outermost level of code; there&#39;s no &quot;outside&quot; a file.\r\n\r\nLuckily, all Lua files, when they&#39;re loaded as a chunk, are automatically variadic, meaning they get the `...` to access their argument list.\r\n\r\nWhen you call a file like `lua script.lua foo bar`, inside script.lua, `...` will actually contain the two arguments &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;, so that&#39;s also a convenient way to access arguments when using Lua for standalone scripts.\r\n\r\nIn your example, it&#39;s actually quite similar. Most likely, somewhere else your script gets loaded with `load()`, which returns a function that you can call—and, you guessed it, pass arguments to.\r\n\r\nImagine the following situation:\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nfunction foo(a, b)\r\n   print(b)\r\n   print(a)\r\nend\r\n\r\nfoo(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is almost equivalent to\r\n\r\n```lua\r\nfunction foo(...)\r\n   local a, b = ...\r\n   print(b)\r\n   print(a)\r\nend\r\n\r\nfoo(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is 100% (Except maybe in performance) equivalent to\r\n\r\n```lua\r\n-- Note that [[ string ]] is just a convenient syntax for multiline &quot;strings&quot;\r\nfoo = load([[\r\n   local a, b = ...\r\n   print(b)\r\n   print(a)\r\n]])\r\n\r\nfoo(&#39;hello&#39;, &#39;world&#39;)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022638/what-is-object-in-lua-good-for/58025031#58025031","title":"What is &quot;object = {...}&quot; in lua good for?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":4889587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af85ccfc89eac53e57cdb901e7c39372?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dahk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4889587/dahk"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570667557,"creation_date":1570667557,"answer_id":58313902,"question_id":58022638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58313902","body_markdown":"Put the following text at the start of the file:\r\n\r\n    local args = {...}\r\n    for __, arg in ipairs(args) do\r\n    \tprint(arg)\r\n    end\r\n\r\nAnd it reveals that:\r\n \r\n- args[1] is the name of the addon\r\n- args[2] is a (empty) table passed by reference to all files in the same addon\r\n\r\nInformation inserted to args[2] is therefore available to different files.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022638/what-is-object-in-lua-good-for/58313902#58313902","title":"What is &quot;object = {...}&quot; in lua good for?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1049,"user_id":6635287,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rbH3f.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Radinator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6635287/radinator"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":74,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58025031,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570667557,"creation_date":1568959699,"question_id":58022638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022638","body_markdown":"I recently read about lua and addons for the game &quot;World of Warcraft&quot;. Since the interface language for addons is lua and I want to learn a new language, I thought this was a good idea.\r\n\r\nBut there is this one thing I can&#39;t get to know. In almost every addon there is this line on the top which looks for me like a constructor that creates a object on which member I can have access to. This line goes something like this:\r\n\r\n    object = {...}\r\n\r\nI know that if a function returns several values (which is IMHO one huge plus for lua) and I don&#39;t want to store them seperatly in several values, I can just write\r\n\r\n    myArray = {SomeFunction()}\r\n\r\nwhere `myArray` is now a table that contains the values and I can access the values by indexing it (`myArray[4]`). Since the elements are not explicitly typed because only the values themselfe hold their type, this is fine for lua. I also know that &quot;...&quot; can be used for a parameter array in a function for the case that the function does not know how many parameter it gets when called (like `String[] args` in java).

(I fixed the code above for those that might want to copy/paste)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/akgf0.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022636/semantic-ui-form-validation-basic-setup/58034293#58034293","title":"Semantic-ui Form Validation basic setup"}],"owner":{"reputation":159,"user_id":8116088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/118e7985cfe1aa9a8dcc0c149d22f6dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8116088/andrew"},"last_editor":{"reputation":159,"user_id":8116088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/118e7985cfe1aa9a8dcc0c149d22f6dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8116088/andrew"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569260819,"creation_date":1568959688,"last_edit_date":1569008606,"question_id":58022636,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022636","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new to semantic-ui and to javascript as well, so please bear with me. I have a basic form that I&#39;m trying to get working with the built-in form validation semantic-ui provides. This form is part of a web app using node, express, and pug. The structure of the specific form (view) I&#39;m working on looks like this:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSorry for using a picture but I&#39;m trying to keep this high-level.\r\nAs you can see, I have a form (with I believe the requisite classes), a submit button and a script block at the end, which is where I&#39;ve got the validation code at the moment.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my validation code such as it is:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n     $(&#39;#new-password-form&#39;).form({\r\n        on: &#39;blur&#39;,\r\n        fields: {\r\n          password: {\r\n            identifier : &#39;password&#39;,\r\n            rules: [\r\n              {\r\n                type  : &#39;empty&#39;,\r\n                prompt: &#39;You must enter a password&#39;\r\n              },\r\n              {\r\n                type  : &#39;regExp[/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[0-9])(?=.*[!@#\\$%\\^&amp;\\*])(?=.{8,})/]&#39;,\r\n                prompt: &#39;Your password must be at least 8 characters long, and contain upper and lower case characters, digit(s), and symbol(s)&#39;\r\n              }\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }, {\r\n          onSuccess : function(e){\r\n            e.preventDefault();\r\n          }\r\n      });\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, validation isn&#39;t working. When I click the submit button the form attempts a regular get submit and it&#39;s as if the javascript isn&#39;t even there somehow. Yet it is there. Node is showing everything is properly fetched and loaded by the browser. Inspecting the rendered HTML shows everything is there, and I see no errors in the console. The page appears to have loaded all the requisite files successfully as follows:\r\n\r\n    GET /enroll/new 200 31.281 ms - 2652\r\n    GET /stylesheets/style.css 200 0.859 ms - 735\r\n    GET /jquery/jquery.js 200 1.491 ms - 280364\r\n    GET /ui/semantic.min.css 200 1.508 ms - 628536\r\n    GET /ui/semantic.min.js 200 2.070 ms - 275709\r\n    GET /images/amm.png 200 2.068 ms - 25415\r\n    GET /ui/semantic.min.css 200 0.418 ms - 628536\r\n    GET /favicon.ico 404 9.768 ms - 1499\r\n\r\nSo what gives? Can someone tell me what I&#39;m doing wrong? Happy to provide more detail if what I have here isn&#39;t enough.\r\n\r\n**Update:**\r\n\r\nI extracted the HTML to a flat file, and relinked the assets (png, js, css) so there is no server involved at all. The page loads in the browser just fine. I get the exact same behavior (nothing happens when submit is clicked except the page reloads with get parameters—default non-js behavior AFAIK). It&#39;s making me think something is wrong with jQuery or javascript itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/GVq2f.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022636/semantic-ui-form-validation-basic-setup","title":"Semantic-ui Form Validation basic setup"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","keras"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1695,"user_id":7212365,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FBxLp.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zihaozhihao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7212365/zihaozhihao"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568964533,"creation_date":1568964533,"answer_id":58023734,"question_id":58022629,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023734","body_markdown":"Since `K` and `P` have the same size of 0-axis, you need to expand dimension of `P` at the end.

would like to extend an existing JavaScript library which already exists as a global variable.\r\n\r\nThat library may principally be described as a factory function with additional properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndeclare function existingLib ():any\r\ndeclare namespace existingLib {\r\n// additional classes, functions, properties\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI would now like to add some more stuff to this (already existing) namespace:\r\n```\r\nnamespace existingLib {\r\n  export const a = &#39;test&#39; // just as an example\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut, unfortunately, the compiler always creates a local variable `existingLib` which shadows the global one with the same name (which may easily be verified using the TypeScript Playground):\r\n```\r\n&quot;use strict&quot;;\r\nvar existingLib;\r\n(function (existingLib) {\r\n    existingLib.a = &#39;test&#39;; // just as an example\r\n})(existingLib || (existingLib = {}));\r\n```\r\nHow should my code look like in order to properly extend my library? Shouldn&#39;t `declare function existingLib` be sufficient tell the compiler that there already exists an &quot;external&quot; variable which should not be overwritten/shadowed?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\n**Outcome:**\r\n\r\nWith the help of Titian Cernicova-Dragomir it turned out, that TypeScript seems to assume code declaring namespaces to run in a global environment - thus, the &quot;extra&quot; `var` declaration may safely be inserted in order to avoid potential ReferenceErrors because of a missing global variable `existingLib`.\r\n\r\nIn my case, however, the packaging process surrounded the compiler output by an IIFE (in order to avoid pollution of the global namespace) - which made the extra `var` local and shadowed the actual global variable with the same name. The solution was to &quot;inject&quot; the global `existingLib` as an argument into the IIFE - now, the extra `var` statement is simply ignored and does not cause any harm any longer...\r\n\r\nMany thanks to Titian for his ideas which finally led me to that solution!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022625/typescript-compiler-ignores-existing-namespace","title":"Typescript compiler ignores existing namespace"},{"tags":["performance","graylog2"],"owner":{"reputation":570,"user_id":1578946,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8671a0544851d5d567097bde74c2a08c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"vikas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1578946/vikas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568959632,"creation_date":1568959632,"question_id":58022624,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022624","body_markdown":"We are ingesting huge volume of logs in Graylog and have developed custom HTTP output plugin to POST the logs into another application.\r\nNow, I need to benchmark the Graylog&#39;s HTTP output plugin.\r\nWhat strategy I can apply?

Modern Android ```WebView``` is just an instance of Google Chrome wrapped in android view. As you understand this instance needs to be run on separate process as it does. If one chooses to dig deep he will find out that the communication between android app and ```WebView``` is done via AIDL service as all the interprocess communications should be done in android.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the time needed to write an AIDL call into stack allocate memory and form message(main AIDL method of communication), send it, unwrap in Chrome, parse, execute javascript and do all this operations one more in order to answer - 10ms - 50ms is very low latency. \r\n\r\nMaybe ArCore has its own its own js processor to handle js files fast. Or Google Chrome has its own method to communicate with ArCore(or inner instance). I don&#39;t know that - but it is Google developed products - I think they know their shortcuts.\r\n\r\nCustom ```WebView``` may work - the only thing is that basically it will be a new version of browser you will need to support your js for it separately from all the other browsers due to a whole bunch of possible reasons.\r\n\r\nHope it helps you somehow.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022622/how-to-call-a-function-in-webview-javascript-from-android-java-without-delay/58066236#58066236","title":"How to call a function in WebView Javascript from Android Java without delay?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":217,"user_id":8924712,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/10ad6013540322a43024545c3fe6f4e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Alfaizkhan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8924712/alfaizkhan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569828629,"creation_date":1569828629,"answer_id":58163340,"question_id":58022622,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58163340","body_markdown":"From kitkat onwards use evaluateJavascript method instead loadUrl to call the javascript functions like below :\r\n\r\n     if (android.os.Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {\r\n        webView.evaluateJavascript(&quot;enable();&quot;, null);\r\n    } else {\r\n        webView.loadUrl(&quot;javascript:enable();&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nyou can Use function call delay by setting :\r\n\r\n    window.setTimeout(function () { ... })\r\n\r\n\r\nBut ,It won&#39;t necessarily run right away, neither will explicitly setting the delay.

Just for the sake of simplicity I have coded UpdateShelf Constructor Like this:\r\n\r\n    public UpdateShelf(MainDashboard MainWindow, ShelfViewModel shelf, ObservableCollection&lt;ShelfViewModel&gt; gridList)\r\n    {\r\n    \t    InitializeComponent();\r\n            shelfViewModel = shelf ?? new ShelfViewModel();\r\n            shelfViewModel.FloorModel = new FloorViewModel(){Name=&quot;Floor One&quot;};\r\n            DataContext = shelfViewModel;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**SECOND UPDATE**\r\n\r\nIf i remove Datacontext from Constructor to Loaded Function. It works as expected, but why is this happening and ***is it better to set datacontext in loaded function?***\r\n\r\n    public UpdateShelf(MainDashboard MainWindow, ShelfViewModel shelf, ObservableCollection&lt;ShelfViewModel&gt; gridList)\r\n    {\r\n    \t\tInitializeComponent();\r\n    \t\tshelfViewModel = shelf ?? new ShelfViewModel();\r\n    \t\tshelfViewModel.FloorModel = new FloorViewModel(){Name=&quot;Floor One&quot;};\r\n    \t\t #region[Events Registrations]\r\n             Loaded += new RoutedEventHandler(UpdateShelfView_Loaded);\r\n             Unloaded += new RoutedEventHandler(UpdateShelfView_UnLoaded);\r\n             #endregion\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    void UpdateShelfView_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n    \tDataContext = shelfViewModel;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/quicoli/WPF-AutoComplete-TextBox\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022611/selectionchanged-called-before-onapplytemplate-in-wpf-custom-control","title":"SelectionChanged Called before OnApplyTemplate in wpf Custom Control"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3712,"user_id":4385889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0hjo.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4385889/andrew"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568960874,"post_id":58022610,"comment_id":102448419,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022610/only-mm-part-of-mm-dd-yyyy-is-assigned-to-variable#comment102448419_58022610"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2337,"user_id":1946016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0c5d167d76c943145ee2d9af55a1b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"karthikdivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946016/karthikdivi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2337,"user_id":1946016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0c5d167d76c943145ee2d9af55a1b99?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"karthikdivi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1946016/karthikdivi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568960750,"last_edit_date":1568960750,"creation_date":1568959659,"answer_id":58022630,"question_id":58022610,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022630","body_markdown":"You can solve using three following ways\r\n\r\n1.

To resolve that do the following steps:-\r\n\r\n - Checkout to the develop branch\r\n - Take the latest pull \r\n - checkout back to the branch you were trying to push changes from \r\n - Run `git merge develop`\r\n - Now whatever ide you are using will show you the merge conflicts resolve them and stage and commit the changes\r\n - now push the changes and raise a pull request\r\n\r\nI hope this helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022588/resolving-merge-conflict-in-a-pull-request-locally/58023041#58023041","title":"Resolving merge conflict in a pull request locally"}],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":8548791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb1644d334b9fb862429f9fb7a60cdc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"StarLord","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8548791/starlord"},"last_editor":{"reputation":37,"user_id":8548791,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb1644d334b9fb862429f9fb7a60cdc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"StarLord","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8548791/starlord"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569224679,"creation_date":1568959393,"last_edit_date":1569224679,"question_id":58022588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022588","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using bit-bucket. I have a repository called Cosmo in a bit-bucket group. I took a folk of it and worked in my fork. Let&#39;s call it Cosmo-Folk. Cosmo has 2 branches called develop and master. Develop is used to put the latest code from all the developers. Later the admin check the develop and merge it to master so it will trigger CI CD servers.\r\n\r\nIn my Cosmo-Folk I have the master and my feature branch (devops). I take the latest code from Cosmo (develop) to my master. Then merge it to my feature branch (which I&#39;m currently working).\r\n\r\nThen After working I do the pulls from my remote called origin (cloud Cosmo-Folk) and resolve conflicts and sync it with my local repository. Which means Cosmo-folk and my PC has the same code now. After all that I create a pull request from Cosmo-Folk/feature/devops -&gt; Cosmo/develop. Then I get merge conflicts before merging. This is explained in the image bellow.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nSo my question is as in bit-bucket I can&#39;t edit files I need to pull the conflict locally and resolve it, and then push or do what ever to make that merge conflict go away and merge the pull request to Cosmo/develop. How can I do that? I&#39;m new to git and explanation with the answer will be valuable.

Enums however list each type within itself as values.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022555/iterate-enum-internal-values-in-kotlin/58023109#58023109","title":"iterate enum internal values in kotlin"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":120171,"user_id":9204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c79937a093ff9e963c563e22cd385f30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexey Romanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9204/alexey-romanov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568981218,"post_id":58023412,"comment_id":102458376,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022555/iterate-enum-internal-values-in-kotlin/58023412#comment102458376_58023412"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":403,"user_id":7719064,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/330b14ebe09d3c66209141f6268fe033?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Akshay Raiyani","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7719064/akshay-raiyani"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568963368,"creation_date":1568963368,"answer_id":58023412,"question_id":58022555,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023412","body_markdown":"Use the latest version of enum\r\n\r\n    @StringDef(Female, Male)\r\n    @Retention(AnnotationRetention.SOURCE)\r\n    annotation class Gender {\r\n        companion object {\r\n            const val Female = &quot;female&quot;\r\n            const val Male = &quot;male&quot;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFor More [information][1] \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://android.jlelse.eu/android-performance-avoid-using-enum-on-android-326be0794dc3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022555/iterate-enum-internal-values-in-kotlin/58023412#58023412","title":"iterate enum internal values in kotlin"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":120171,"user_id":9204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c79937a093ff9e963c563e22cd385f30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexey Romanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9204/alexey-romanov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":120171,"user_id":9204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c79937a093ff9e963c563e22cd385f30?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexey Romanov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9204/alexey-romanov"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568983571,"last_edit_date":1568983571,"creation_date":1568981034,"answer_id":58028055,"question_id":58022555,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58028055","body_markdown":"Android-specific, since it&#39;s mentioned in your tags: Proguard can&#39;t optimize this case (or at least [it couldn&#39;t in 2018][1]), so it may be better to do:\r\n\r\n    enum class Gender {\r\n        Female,\r\n        Male\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    val Gender.s get() = when(this) {\r\n        Female -&gt;

currently have a spring boot application (version - 2.1.8.RELEASE) which exposed rest webservice that provide some basic email functionality.

to ask a question as a different extension to this [question][1]\r\n\r\nMy objective is :\r\n\r\nGiven a text file that has all possible characters in it, inclusive of all punctuations, special characters and symbols, I just need to extract lowercase alphabetic phrases out of it. \r\n\r\nWhat I do right now is : \r\n\r\n    with open(&#39;lmdata.txt&#39;,&#39;a&#39;) as ink:\r\n        for

code reads a json element then takes only alphabetic phrases and then appends to a text file.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the **problem** is I need to run this for a large volume of data. For `1GB` text file, which contains approx `15386594` lines of text takes `94.47970027092379` seconds when I log with `timeit` . \r\n\r\nNow considering I need to process `15GB` of raw text files, I am presuming it would take `15x` time to complete this.\r\n\r\nSo the question is : how to make it faster (if possible)   \r\n\r\n**EDIT 1**\r\n\r\nAs per @JanChristophTerasa &#39;s suggestion, tried compiling the `regex` prior to being called in every iteration, and tried running it, the running time came down to  `81.98409761895891` seconds.\r\n\r\n    r = re.compile(r&quot;[^a-z ]&quot;)\r\n\r\nthen while writing :\r\n\r\n    ink.write(&quot;%s \\n&quot; %(r.sub(&quot;&quot;,element[&#39;lines&#39;][0].lower())))\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42742810/speed-up-millions-of-regex-replacements-in-python-3","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022540/faster-alternative-to-re-sub-in-python3","title":"Faster alternative to re.sub() in Python3"},{"tags":["angular","rxjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4780,"user_id":8618350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5f100e1a27815164cb9a9bf00487858?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fan Cheung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8618350/fan-cheung"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568965221,"post_id":58022536,"comment_id":102450361,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022536/how-rxjs-filter-postponds-http-calls-till-the-criteria-matches-in-below-code#comment102450361_58022536"},{"owner":{"reputation":295,"user_id":10047959,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1689090511198424/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ameer Pappay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10047959/ameer-pappay"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4780,"user_id":8618350,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d5f100e1a27815164cb9a9bf00487858?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Fan Cheung","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8618350/fan-cheung"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568967412,"post_id":58022536,"comment_id":102451371,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022536/how-rxjs-filter-postponds-http-calls-till-the-criteria-matches-in-below-code#comment102451371_58022536"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1024,"user_id":11011793,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0p7CT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"MoxxiManagarm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11011793/moxximanagarm"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568961779,"creation_date":1568961779,"answer_id":58023058,"question_id":58022536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58023058","body_markdown":"As you mention you have an interceptor.

It will be very helpful if anyone explain the data flow between model and loss or send me the reference link to understand it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022523/how-data-flows-between-loss-function-and-model-in-keras","title":"How data flows between loss function and model in keras?"},{"tags":["java","kotlin","corda"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":9875429,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/V6tHv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ashutosh Meher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9875429/ashutosh-meher"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570023565,"post_id":58022520,"comment_id":102783488,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022520/corda-scheduling-event-issue#comment102783488_58022520"}],"owner":{"reputation":89,"user_id":6657101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-a3yyBoohpso/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAOY/G0SvCsRJZoc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sanjay singh Bisht","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6657101/sanjay-singh-bisht"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3625,"user_id":8566549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0268a88dfbca27a1f18e8ea3974e765a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hasta Dhana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8566549/hasta-dhana"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568962969,"creation_date":1568958915,"last_edit_date":1568962969,"question_id":58022520,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022520","body_markdown":"how to fix this issue even i am doing same did in github samples.\r\n\r\n&gt;`net.corda.core.internal.TransactionDeserialisationException: Failed to deserialise group OUTPUTS_GROUP at index 0 in transaction: net.corda.core.contracts.TransactionState (erased) -&gt;

You can use `input[id^=&#39;points&#39;]` for example. This will look for `input` elements with a the `id` that starts with `points`.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n    var results = $(&quot;input[id^=&#39;points&#39;]&quot;);\r\n    var points = &#39;Enter a valid point.&#39;;\r\n    var regex = &#39;/^[A-Za-z!@#&gt;&lt;/!?\\$%\\^\\&amp;*\\)\\(+=._-]+$/g&#39;;\r\n    results.each(function(i, el) {\r\n      if ($(el).val().match(regex)) {\r\n        console.log(&quot;Match on #&quot; + $(el).attr(&quot;id&quot;));\r\n        $(el).next(&#39;span&#39;).html(&#39;&#39;);\r\n        $(&quot;&lt;span&gt;&quot;, {\r\n          class: &quot;errTextboxClass&quot;\r\n        }).css(&quot;color&quot;, &quot;#e03b3b;&quot;).html(points).insertAfter($(el));\r\n        $(el).focus();\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\nUsing `.each()` we can iterate each of the matching elements and test them against the RegEx pattern.

I know this question has been asked before many times on this forum and I followed the answers to reach where I am but I am having difficulties getting the result.\r\n\r\nAt my root level there are two folders: home and usr\r\n\r\nMy node lives at **/usr/bin/node** (`which node` gives this path)\r\n\r\nMy node file lives at **/home/ubuntu/my-crm-app/test.js**\r\n\r\nThe test.js has just one `console.log(&quot;this is a test&quot;)` - but I will be writing more code later on if this works.\r\n\r\nNow if I execute `/usr/bin/node /home/ubuntu/my-crm-app/test.js` from anywhere it prints out the log, \r\n\r\nIn fact even if I do `node /home/ubuntu/my-crm-app/test.js` it prints out the log. So this means my paths for the node and project file are correct and working.\r\n\r\nI typed `crontab -e` in the system and choose vim basic as my editor to write the cron job. It looks something like this:\r\n\r\n    # Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.\r\n    # \r\n    # Each task to run has to be defined through a single line\r\n    # indicating with different fields when the task will be run\r\n    # and what command to run for the task\r\n    # \r\n    # To define the time you can provide concrete values for\r\n    # minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),\r\n    # and day of week (dow) or use &#39;*&#39; in these fields (for &#39;any&#39;).# \r\n    # Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron&#39;s system\r\n    # daemon&#39;s notion of time and timezones.\r\n    # \r\n    # Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through\r\n    # email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).\r\n    # \r\n    # For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts\r\n    # at 5 a.m every week with:\r\n    # 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/\r\n    # \r\n    # For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)\r\n    # \r\n    # m h  dom mon dow   command\r\n    */1 * * * * /usr/bin/node /home/ubuntu/my-crm-app/test.js\r\n\r\nSo I want to execute the log every one minute. I save the vim file and come out of it and wait and wait and nothing happens. From what I understand my cron syntax is correct. So what seems to be the problem? Do I need to give a different path syntax for node and my test.js within the vim file?\r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022510/ec2-cron-job-not-executing-my-node-js-script","title":"EC2 cron job not executing my Node.js script"},{"tags":["python-3.x","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":423560,"user_id":2901002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMDvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jezrael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2901002/jezrael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568959447,"post_id":58022509,"comment_id":102447904,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022509/how-to-evaluate-multiple-two-columns-in-a-dataframe-and-create-another-column#comment102447904_58022509"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":3492735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/183501434/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3492735","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3492735/user3492735"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":423560,"user_id":2901002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMDvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jezrael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2901002/jezrael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568959843,"post_id":58022509,"comment_id":102448063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58022509/how-to-evaluate-multiple-two-columns-in-a-dataframe-and-create-another-column#comment102448063_58022509"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":3492735,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/183501434/picture?type=large","display_name":"user3492735","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3492735/user3492735"},"last_editor":{"reputation":985,"user_id":2970853,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/507188635/picture?type=large","display_name":"henrywongkk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970853/henrywongkk"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568959411,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568959388,"creation_date":1568958844,"last_edit_date":1568959388,"question_id":58022509,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58022509","body_markdown":"Im working with an if then statement where I am evaluating 2 columns in a dataframe (col2 and col3).
