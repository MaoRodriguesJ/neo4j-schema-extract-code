The Laravel based plugin will provide the services consumed by the mobile I once already succeed in storing only and only one prescription as an order meta data and displayed it.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am faced, and still, with a problem displaying multiple images at the admin preview page specifically. Here is the code used for that:\r\n```\r\necho &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;margin-left: 20px;&#39;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prescription&lt;/h3&gt;&quot;;\r\necho &#39;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n  &lt;hr&gt;\r\n  &lt;div class=&quot;wc-order-preview-prescription-wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;a href=&quot;{{data._custom_px_src}}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;img src=&quot;{{data._custom_px_src}}&quot; style=&quot;width: 300pt&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/a&gt;\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;br /&gt;&#39;;\r\necho &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I used the **woocommerce_admin_order_preview_end** hook and the above code sample written within a function wired to the hook.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I copied the above code from the internet and I do not know where the **data** object comes from and I can access only it the way it is listed/shown above and I cannot use it, for example, within a control statement (i.e., using it within a foreach to iterate over if there will be multiple values).\r\n\r\nIf I tried to write something like:\r\n\r\n    foreach($data._custom_px_src as $image)\r\n\r\nit gives me error telling me that **data** is undefined!.\r\n\r\nWhat I need is that someone telling me about the **data** object.

It&#39;s not a perfect solution since my use of `case_when` will prioritize earlier options (i.e. if there are two different cities attributed to one address AND two different zip codes, you&#39;ll only see that there are two different cities--you will need to address this if it matters with additional `case_when` statements). However, getting the length of unique items is a reasonable heuristic in this case if you don&#39;t need a perfectly granular solution.\r\n\r\n    df %&gt;% \r\n      group_by(address) %&gt;% \r\n      mutate( \r\n        match_type = case_when(\r\n          all(\r\n            length(unique(city))  == 1,\r\n            length(unique(state)) == 1,\r\n            length(unique(zip5))  == 1,\r\n            length(unique(zip9))  == 1) ~ &quot;Exact Match&quot;,\r\n          length(unique(city)) &gt; 1      ~ &quot;Different City&quot;,\r\n          length(unique(state)) &gt; 1     ~ &quot;Different State&quot;,\r\n          length(unique(zip5)) &gt; 1      ~ &quot;Different Zip5&quot;,\r\n          length(unique(zip9)) &gt; 1      ~ &quot;Different Zip9&quot;\r\n        ))\r\n\r\nOtherwise, you&#39;ll have to do iterative grouping (address + other variable) and mutate in a Boolean column as you alluded to. \r\n\r\n#Edit\r\nOne additional approach I just thought of if you need a more granular solution is to utilize the addition of an id column (`df %&gt;% rowid_to_column(&quot;ID&quot;)`) and then a full join of the table to itself by address with suffixes (e.g. `suffix = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;)`), filtering out same IDs and calling distinct (since each comparison is there twice), and then you can make Boolean columns with mutate for the pairwise comparisons. It may be too computationally intensive, depending on the size of your dataset, but it should work on the scale of a few thousand if you have a reasonable amount of RAM.

I can use that solution to create a T/F column for each type of duplicate/group_by match, but I&#39;m trying to create exclusive categories. How could my conditions also take differences into account? The exact match rows should show true only on the &quot;exact match&quot; column, and false for every other column. If I define my columns simply by feeding different combinations of columns to `group_by`, the exact match rows will never return a False.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6986657/find-duplicated-rows-based-on-2-columns-in-data-frame-in-r","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243390/categorizing-types-of-duplicates-in-r","title":"Categorizing types of duplicates in R"},{"tags":["tfs","server","foundation"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10497275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00722151042a03f33b43894d07518b9a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10497275/paul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570638754,"post_id":58265163,"comment_id":102978704,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243389/how-to-build-a-query-in-the-tfs-query-editor-to-show-stories-were-in-active-stat/58265163#comment102978704_58265163"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34064,"user_id":5391065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b615692abd82961458da80dd640f3300?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PatrickLu-MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5391065/patricklu-msft"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570433382,"creation_date":1570433382,"answer_id":58265163,"question_id":58243389,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58265163","body_markdown":"You can filter for work items **by the date** on which they were changed or for a specific time period.

I think it stems from the fact that the IDE (or is it an Angular service?) is parsing and checking what&#39;s within `&lt;textarea&gt;` as if it were regular HTML whereas textarea content is really just raw text.  The right approach might be to just consider everything inside `&lt;textarea&gt;` as a literal string.\r\n\r\n###Original Question\r\nIn PhpStorm, I am developing an Angular project.  When in the template I use the open curly braces within a textarea like so:\r\n```\r\n&lt;textarea&gt;\r\n  {}\r\n&lt;/textarea&gt;\r\n```\r\nI get the error:\r\n&gt; Unterminated expansion form.  If you have unescaped &#39;{&#39;, use &#39;{{&quot;{&quot;}}&#39; to escape it.\r\n\r\nAssuming this `{` doesn&#39;t make the actual HTML invalid, I would like to mute this error or disable the inspection that generates it.

are several ways you can do this using either JavaScript or jQuery.\r\n\r\nYou could use the [attribute contains][1] selector to find all elements with an id that matches a pattern:\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;[id*=&quot;us_&quot;]&#39;).prop(&#39;checked&#39;, true);\r\n\r\nThis form of selector also works with JavaScript&#39;s native [`document.querySelector()`][2] method.\r\n\r\nHowever, this runs the risk of unintentionally selecting irrelevant elements that happen to match the selector. The selector above would also match an element with an id of &quot;status_code&quot;, for example.\r\n\r\nA better approach is the one that @jonny suggests in his answer. While the id attribute of every element in a document has to be unique, other attributes like &quot;class&quot; do not. This allows you to assign a css class name to a group of related elements and select them by that class name using the [class][3] selector. (Again, this selector also works with the [`document.querySelector`  method][2]).\r\n\r\nPersonally, I dislike using css class names to select related groups of elements because css classes are for styling, not for functionality. So another approach you can use if you want to keep style an function separate is to include [data attributes][4] like so:\r\n\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;check_us-1&quot; checked data-group=&quot;us&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; id=&quot;check_us-2&quot; checked data-group=&quot;us&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nYou can then use the attribute selector to select both inputs:\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;[data-group=&quot;us&quot;]&#39;).prop(&#39;checked&#39;, true);\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-selector/\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelector\r\n  [3]: https://api.jquery.com/class-selector/\r\n  [4]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243376/check-common-dropdown-items-javascript-jquery/58243548#58243548","title":"Check Common Dropdown Items (JavaScript, jQuery)"}],"owner":{"reputation":304,"user_id":9521619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/273196603216654/picture?type=large","display_name":"Gihan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9521619/gihan"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"accepted_answer_id":58243436,"answer_count":3,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1570226252,"creation_date":1570224637,"question_id":58243376,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58243376","body_markdown":"I&#39;m a beginner in coding, and I need some help with the following code. \r\n\r\nSo I have a page like the following one in the example. \r\n\r\nSo far, I tried the following method.

the accepted answer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36227376/better-honeypot-implementation-form-anti-spam\r\n\r\nThat is the PHP for the processing page that your form submits to.\r\n\r\nCopying code from Nicholas Summers&#39; post, I&#39;ll add some sample HTML to clarify it.\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    $honeypot = FALSE;\r\n    if (!empty($_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;]) &amp;&amp; (bool) \r\n    $_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;] == TRUE) {\r\n        $honeypot = TRUE;\r\n        log_spambot($_REQUEST);\r\n        // treat as spambot  -- here we will place the HTML &quot;inline&quot;\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Tasty spam, thanks!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n        exit();  // all done if a spambot\r\n    } else {\r\n        // process as normal -- here we will use a function, note that in PHP\r\n        // scope rules will hide most global variables from the function!\r\n        process_human_response();\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function process_human_response()\r\n    {\r\n       //... get data from $_REQUEST\r\n       //... process data\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Thank you good human!&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt; \r\n\r\nThis shows placing your code and HTML &quot;inline&quot; at the global level for the first case (spam) and in a function for humans just to show another way.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nAs pointed out, the code is often shorter and easier to maintain if you don&#39;t duplicate any of the shared HTML, like this:\r\n\r\nShared beginning of page:\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- and shared CSS, JS files here --&gt; &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\nSome PHP logic to decide if it is a spambot\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    if (isset($_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;]) &amp;&amp; (bool) \r\n    $_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;] == TRUE) {\r\n        $honeypot = TRUE;\r\n

It advises to include an invisible checkbox on your page:\r\n```\r\n&lt;input\r\n  type=&quot;checkbox&quot;\r\n  name=&quot;contact_me_by_fax_only&quot;\r\n  value=&quot;1&quot;\r\n  style=&quot;display:none !important&quot;\r\n  tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;\r\n  autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;\r\n&gt;\r\n```\r\nBut then, PHP is suggested to test whether the checkbox has been checked:\r\n\r\n    $honeypot = FALSE;\r\n    if (!empty($_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;]) &amp;&amp; (bool) \r\n    $_REQUEST[&#39;contact_me_by_fax_only&#39;] == TRUE) {\r\n        $honeypot = TRUE;\r\n        log_spambot($_REQUEST);\r\n        # treat as spambot\r\n    } else {\r\n        # process as normal\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve not used much PHP before. My questions:\r\n\r\n1. Can I just put this PHP in my html code with surrounding `&lt;?php` `?&gt;` tags?\r\n2. If so, does it matter where I put the PHP? Does it have to be after the form (for example)?\r\n3. In the part of the PHP that says `#process as normal`, do I need to put anything in here?\r\n4. Or am I supposed to put the PHP in my post.php file which I created to post my form?\r\n\r\nIf it helps, the form part of my html code:\r\n\r\n    &lt;form action=&quot;post.php&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;\r\n       &lt;/br&gt;\r\n       &lt;label for=&quot;email&quot;&gt;&lt;/label&gt;\r\n       &lt;input type=&quot;email&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter your email address...&quot;\r\n                 name=&quot;email&quot; required&gt;\r\n        &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot; class=&quot;signupbtn&quot;&gt;Sign Up&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;contact_me_by_fax_only&quot;\r\n          value=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;display:none !important&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/form&gt;\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36227376/better-honeypot-implementation-form-anti-spam\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to follow the answer on this.

The only functions you may use are: print, str, int, float, bool, len, list, range, abs, round, pow.  We will not deduct for the use of str(), but you do not actually need it. Do not import libraries.\r\n\r\nKeywords allowed:  if, elif, else, and, or, not, return, def, assert,\r\n\r\nKeywords not allowed:  for, while, in, import.\r\n\r\nNote that you may not use slicing(AKA colons in your indicies). \r\n\r\nI am having trouble implementing this algorithm; I&#39;m not sure what the base case is, how to use a helper method, or how to do the problem without using loops or python list slicing. What I currently have is a helper method called check_diff(), that takes a list as a parameter, recursively iterating through the list and appending to a new list all the possible differences between values in the original list. I was then going to call the method in the is_diff_two() method, in one line checking to see if the diff parameter is in the list - if so, it should return true, if not then false. This is what I have for my helper method thus far, but I cannot figure out how to correctly recurse through the list and get all the possible differences.\r\n\r\n    def check_diff(values):\r\n        diff_list = []\r\n        if len(values) == 1:\r\n            return diff_list\r\n        else:\r\n            diff_list.append(values[0] - check_diff(values[1]))\r\n            return values[0] - check_diff(values[1])\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243369/recursive-algorithm-that-displays-if-it-is-possible-to-choose-two-integers-from","title":"Recursive algorithm that

answer: even if multiple tasks throw exceptions, there will be only one exception thrown by `await Task.WaitAll` and thus the `catch` block will execute only once. The `finally` block always executes once per entry to the `try` block. Long answer follows.\r\n\r\nAwaiting a `Task.WaitAll`, if any wrapped `Task`s throw an exception, throws an `AggregateException` containing exceptions from all of the `Task`s. So assuming you&#39;ve reached the `await Task.WhenAll(tasks)` line without exceptions, here&#39;s what happens:\r\n\r\n 1. `Task.WhenAll` will wait for all the `Task`s to complete, regardless of whether they fault or not.\r\n 2. If all of the `Task`s completed successfully, the `Task.WhenAll` completes successfully, execution resumes at the `await`, end of the `try` block is reached, the `finally` block executes.\r\n 2. If one or more `Task`s finished with an exception, `Task.WhenAll` wraps all of them into an `AggregateException` and completes in a faulted state. The execution resumes at the `await` and the aforementioned `AggregateException` is thrown. The `catch` block is executed and then the `finally` block.\r\n\r\nSo, assuming that one thread enters the `try` block, in both cases when the execution resumes at the `await` only one thread continues the execution. The only way for you to enter the `catch` or `finally` blocks twice is to execute the method twice. \r\n\r\nThe `await` statement does a lot of magic under the hood, but it never causes your execution to continue on multiple threads. One thread `await`s, only one thread picks it up and continues.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243364/would-finally-block-run-once-when-there-are-multiple-tasks-in-the-try-catch/58260295#58260295","title":"Would &#39;finally&#39; block run once when there are multiple Tasks in the try-catch?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":166,"user_id":2014948,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f42c7495166c6df9ff06a963440d906f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Kun Hu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2014948/kun-hu"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570468505,"post_id":58261539,"comment_id":102915154,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243364/would-finally-block-run-once-when-there-are-multiple-tasks-in-the-try-catch/58261539#comment102915154_58261539"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570399040,"creation_date":1570399040,"answer_id":58261539,"question_id":58243364,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58261539","body_markdown":"The `catch` and the `finally` blocks are running once, but can run both.

Essentially I want to make sure that no matter how many remote calls fail, I only have one ticket to investigate. And when next time all calls succeed, the ticket gets resolved automatically.\r\n\r\nHowever, when the remote calls all succeed in the try block, the call in finally block tries to resolve the ticket, but ran into HTTP 412 Precondition Failed, meaning that the ticket I got in try block was somehow updated before the finally block.

Unfortunately, the pdf2htmlEX project is also archived, and no new comments can be added, so I&#39;m adding this information here in the hope that this may help someone else in the future.*\r\n\r\nIn my scenario, the library is called via an ASP.Net wrapper method using System.Diagnostics.Process to convert uploaded files into HTML versions. The Pdf2htmlEX library would work without issue from the Command Prompt, and for some reason, would also work perfectly in my development environment, but not in a production environment (Both of which are Windows Server 2012R2). \r\n\r\nMy first assumption, and correctly so, was that there was a permissions issue. Pdf2htmlEX uses FontForge internally to handle fonts, and one or both use the Windows Temp directory by default to store resource files used in the creation of the HTML and/or other files. And, I &#39;believe&#39; although not confirmed, that it also may use the active user&#39;s `%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` folder...\r\n\r\nWhen running test commands from Command Prompt, you are operating under your user context, and everything your user can do, Pdf2htmlEX can do. So everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nIn a server environment, the process is operating under the ApplicationPoolIdentity, a special IIS user type with limited permissions. Here it failed for me. While, I&#39;d see folders and files created in the Windows Temp folder, they couldn&#39;t be opened by Pdf2HtmlEX to create the end files elsewhere. \r\n\r\n**Solution:** (there may be other solutions for your individual case) \r\nIn my case, adding a new system user, adding that user to the `Users` group, and then setting the IIS worker process to that account resolved the issue. The reason I believe, is that the `Users` group has read/write access to the Windows Temp directory, and potentially other required areas of the system required for Pdf2htmlEX to complete.

in effect you&#39;ll end up with the following behavior:\r\n\r\n* The redefinition is only in effect for the _current user_ - which is probably a good thing, as other users may not expect this change, which can result in unwanted execution of script.\r\n\r\n* Whatever execution policy is in effect will be honored; e.g., if `Restricted` is in effect, invocation will fail altogether.\r\n\r\n* As with the default `Run in PowerShell` command, the window in which the script run will _automatically close_ unless the script explicitly prompts the user before exiting.\r\n\r\nTo exercise more control over how PowerShell invokes the script, use the programmatic method shown next.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n### Programmatic method: \r\n\r\n**Modify the registry** to redefine the `Open` shortcut-menu command for `*.ps1` files at `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1\\shell\\Open\\Command`, as shown below.\r\n\r\n**Important**: If you&#39;ve previously used the GUI method above, you must _manually_ remove the underlying registry definition, otherwise the programmatic redefinition won&#39;t take effect:\r\n\r\n  * Open `regedit.exe` (requires admin rights)\r\n\r\n  * Navigate to `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\FileExts\\.ps1` and _delete_ that key.\r\n\r\n  * Note: At least on Windows 10, trying to remove this key _programmatically_ - e.g. with `reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Explorer\\FileExts\\.ps1\\UserChoice /f` fails due to permission issues, even when running as admin.\r\n\r\n**Note**: \r\n\r\n* The code redefines the command only for the _current user_, which is probably the better approach, because other users may not expect this change, which can result in unwanted execution of script.\r\n\r\n  * If you still want the make the change to _all_ users, set `$forAllUsers` to `$true`, below, but note that you&#39;ll then have to run the code _elevated_ (as admin).\r\n\r\n* Unlike the standard `Run in PowerShell` command, **the code below keeps the window in which the script executes _open_ and the session _alive_.**\r\n\r\n* Whatever execution policy is in effect will be honored; e.g., if `Restricted` is in effect, invocation will fail altogether.\r\n\r\n  * In the code below, you can precede `-File` with something like `-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` to override the effective policy, but I suggest not choosing a less restrictive value than that for security reasons.\r\n\r\n* As with the standard `Run in PowerShell` command, the script executes in the directory in which it is located as the working directory (current location).\r\n\r\n* To customize the exact invocation command, modify the `$cmd = ...` line below.\r\n\r\n   * Notably, to target PowerShell *Core* instead of Windows PowerShell, replace `powershell.exe` with `pwsh.exe`.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Specify if the change should apply to the CURRENT USER only, or to ALL users.\r\n# NOTE: If you set this to $true - which is NOT ADVISABLE - \r\n#       you&#39;ll need to run this code command ELEVATED (as administrator)\r\n$forAllUsers = $false\r\n\r\n# Determine the chosen scope&#39;s target registry key path.\r\n$targetKey = &quot;$((&#39;HKCU&#39;, &#39;HKLM&#39;)[$forAllUsers]):\\Software\\Classes\\Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1\\shell\\Open\\Command&quot;\r\n\r\n# In the user-specific hive (HKCU: == HKEY_CURRENT_USER), the target key\r\n# doesn&#39;t exist by default (whereas it does in the local-machine hive (HLKM: == HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)),\r\n# so we need to make sure that it exists.\r\nif (-not $forAllUsers) {\r\n  $null = New-Item -Force $targetKey -ErrorAction Stop\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Specify the command to use when opening / double-clicking *.ps1 scripts:\r\n# As written here:\r\n#   * The profiles are loaded (add -NoProfile to change).\r\n#   * The current execution policy is respected (add -ExecutionPolicy &lt;policy&gt;)\r\n#   * The window stays open after the script exits (remove -NoExit to change)\r\n#   * Windows PowerShell is targeted - to target PowerShell *Core* instead,\r\n#     replace &#39;powershell.exe&#39; with &#39;pwsh.exe&#39;\r\n# For help with all parameters, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_powershell_exe\r\n$cmd = &quot;`&quot;$((Get-Command powershell.exe)[0].Source)`&quot; -noexit -file `&quot;%1`&quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n#&quot;# Write the command to the registry.\r\nSet-ItemProperty -LiteralPath $targetKey -Name &#39;(default)&#39; -Value $cmd\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### The predefined `Run in PowerShell` shortcut-menu command:\r\n\r\nIt is defined in registry key `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Microsoft.PowerShellScript.1\\shell\\0\\Command` (as of Windows 10) as follows:\r\n\r\n    &quot;C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe&quot; &quot;-Command&quot; &quot;if((Get-ExecutionPolicy ) -ne &#39;AllSigned&#39;) { Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass }; &amp; &#39;%1&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\n* **Unless execution policy `AllSigned` is in effect** - in which case only _signed_ scripts can be executed but are executed _without prompting_  - the command attempts to set the execution policy for the invoked process to `Bypass`, which means that **_any_ script can be executed, but only after the user responds to a _confirmation prompt_ beforehand** (irrespective of whether the script is signed or not, and whether it was downloaded from the web or not).\r\n\r\n  * At least in earlier Windows 7 releases / PowerShell versions, the command was *misdefined*&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt; in a way that effectively ignored the attempt to set the process&#39; execution policy, which meant that whatever execution policy was persistently configured applied - and no confirmation prompt was shown.\r\n\r\n* **Unless the targeted script explicitly pauses to wait for user input before exiting, the window in which the script will _close automatically_** when the script finishes, so you may not get to see its output.\r\n\r\n* The targeted script **executes in the directory in which it is located** as the working directory (current location)\r\n \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;[1] The earlier, broken command definition was `&quot;C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe&quot; &quot;-file&quot; &quot;%1&quot; &quot;-Command&quot; &quot;if((Get-ExecutionPolicy ) -ne AllSigned) { Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass }&quot;`, which meant what anything after `-file &quot;%1&quot;` was passed as _arguments_ to file `&quot;%1&quot;` instead of the intended execution of the commands following `-Command`; additionally - a moot point - the `AllSigned` operand would have need to be quoted.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243310/how-to-open-multiple-power-shell-automatically-in-power-shell/58245206#58245206","title":"How to open multiple power shell automatically in power shell?"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12166539,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3f735f4da64c831aba3b6115aea8881?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Haresh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12166539/haresh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":2,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570247585,"creation_date":1570224145,"question_id":58243310,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58243310","body_markdown":"I have my_project.ps1 file from which I am activating virtual environment &amp;

have a sheet &quot;check released&quot; that takes values from &quot;sheet &quot;Log&quot;. Your aim is enter a &quot;release date&quot; on &quot;check released&quot; and have that updated to &quot;Log&quot;, and then reflected in &quot;check released&quot;. The approach you took was to edit the actual linked &quot;release date&quot; value on &quot;check released&quot;. Not surprisingly this wasn&#39;t successful because it was merely taking date from &quot;Log&quot;.\r\n\r\nIn the following code:\r\n\r\n - I have used a helper column on &quot;check released&quot; where the date can be entered. \r\n - The onEdit(e) script detects the new value, finds the equivalent row on &quot;Log&quot;.\r\n - The script updates the &quot;Date&quot; column on &quot;Log&quot; - at this point, the values on &quot;check released&quot; are automatically updated. \r\n - Then the script deletes the value in the helper column.\r\n\r\n**Matching from &quot;Log&quot; to &quot;check released&quot;**\r\n\r\nThe matching of rows from &quot;check released&quot; to &quot;Log&quot; relies on several elements:\r\n\r\n 1. No record has a truly unique identifier. \r\n 2. However, the values of Job, Draw and Invoice numbers, when each is converted to a string and concatenated, generate a unique value that can be used to compare values from &quot;Log&quot; to &quot;check released&quot;.\r\n 3. The values on &quot;Log&quot; are processed in a loop to create a 1D array of concatenated values.\r\n 4. Event objects provide the edited Row on &quot;check released&quot;; and the Job, Draw and Invoice values in that row are concatenated.\r\n 5. Using the Javascript [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) method, the script &#39;finds&#39; the row on &quot;Log&quot; that matches the unique concatenated value from the edited row. \r\n\r\nOther items to note:\r\n \r\n\r\n - the actual size of the data range on &quot;Log&quot; and &quot;check released&quot; is determined by using `getlastRow()`\r\n - `getRange` and `getValues` are run once each for &quot;Log&quot; and &quot;check released&quot;\r\n - Meaningful names for variables have been chosen to reflect their purpose; this assists in reading and understanding the code.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e) {\r\n      // 5824330602\r\n      var ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();\r\n      var ui = SpreadsheetApp.getUi();\r\n      var logsheet = &quot;Log&quot;;\r\n      var log = ss.getSheetByName(logsheet);\r\n      var checkrsheet = &quot;check released&quot;;\r\n      var checkr = ss.getSheetByName(checkrsheet);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      // get Log data\r\n      var logFR = 2;\r\n      var logLR = log.getLastRow();\r\n      var logLC = 4;\r\n      var logRange = log.getRange(logFR,1,logLR-logFR+1,logLC);\r\n      // Logger.log(logRange.getA1Notation());// DEBUG\r\n      var logValues = logRange.getValues();\r\n    \r\n      \r\n      // get check released data\r\n      var checkrRange = checkr.getRange(logFR,1,logLR-logFR+1,logLC);\r\n      //Logger.log(checkrRange.getA1Notation());\r\n      var checkrValues = checkrRange.getValues();\r\n      \r\n      \r\n      // build array of uniquelogitems\r\n      var logitems=[];\r\n      for (var i=0; i&lt;logValues.length; i++) {\r\n        var logjob = logValues[i][0].toString();\r\n        var logdraw = logValues[i][1].toString();\r\n        var loginv = logValues[i][2].toString();\r\n        var logid = logjob+logdraw+loginv;\r\n        //Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: LOG: Job= &quot;+logjob);\r\n        //Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: LOG: draw= &quot;+logdraw);\r\n        //Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: LOG: inv= &quot;+loginv);\r\n        //Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: LOG: concat= &quot;+logid);\r\n        var logid = logjob+logdraw+loginv;\r\n        logitems.push(logid);\r\n      }\r\n      //Logger.log(logitems); //DEBUG\r\n    \r\n      \r\n      // get the event objects\r\n      var editedRow = e.range.getRow();\r\n      var editedCol = e.range.getColumn();\r\n      var editedSheet = e.range.getSheet().getSheetName();\r\n      var editedValue = e.value;\r\n      // Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: row = &quot;+editedRow+&quot;, column = &quot;+editedCol+&quot;, Sheet = &quot;+editedSheet)\r\n    \r\n      \r\n      // apply logic to test whether this edit should be processed\r\n      // Column 5 (&quot;E&quot;) is the helper column\r\n      if(editedRow &gt;= logFR &amp;&amp; editedRow &lt;=logLR &amp;&amp; editedCol === 5 &amp;&amp; editedSheet === checkrsheet){\r\n        // the edit is in Column E (Date), between the first and last rows of data, on the &quot;check released&quot; sheet\r\n        //Logger.log(&quot;DEBUG: edit is OK. edit row = &quot;+editedRow+&quot;.

I have a node server within a docker container. Right now I would like to have it communicate with the parent system&#39;s CUP server. However when I do an ajax call to the server, with port 631 exposed I get a 400 bad request error. \r\nWhen looking at the CUPS logs it gives this reason for the rejection:\r\n\r\n&gt; Request from &quot;localhost&quot; using invalid Host: field &quot;host.docker.internal:631&quot;\r\n\r\nNow to even access the parent machine I have to use host.docker.internal to gain access, but I have not figured out a way to get cups to ignore the host or think its localhost. \r\n\r\nCups is watching for any serverAlias, and anything on port 631 so it &quot;should&quot; accept the call.

I would even say I&#39;ve never used them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243287/split-the-string-every-special-character-with-regular-expressions","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Split the string every special character with regular expressions"},{"tags":["c++","boost"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":353,"user_id":7908019,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wBTC1gSxMPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/85JVWoAxQI0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gerard097","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7908019/gerard097"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570225061,"post_id":58243286,"comment_id":102859002,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243286/whats-the-difference-between-using-boostequality-comparablet-versus-overrid#comment102859002_58243286"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11809532,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8b1f4c19614d0edbe3c99cfff693bb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"j__gt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11809532/j-gt"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":353,"user_id":7908019,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wBTC1gSxMPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/85JVWoAxQI0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gerard097","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7908019/gerard097"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570227050,"post_id":58243286,"comment_id":102859460,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243286/whats-the-difference-between-using-boostequality-comparablet-versus-overrid#comment102859460_58243286"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":11809532,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8b1f4c19614d0edbe3c99cfff693bb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"j__gt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11809532/j-gt"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":353,"user_id":7908019,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wBTC1gSxMPU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABY/85JVWoAxQI0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gerard097","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7908019/gerard097"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570227601,"post_id":58243286,"comment_id":102859585,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243286/whats-the-difference-between-using-boostequality-comparablet-versus-overrid#comment102859585_58243286"},{"owner":{"reputation":9622,"user_id":9716597,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f97c613dca0b157b40551a0d756abeb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"L.

standardized on using JSON:API for our REST endpoints, however; not all of our data revolves around repositories and it seems that CRNK requires repositories in order to work.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?\r\n\r\n**Example**\r\n\r\nI wrote a very simple Spring Boot 2.1.9 example that has a single controller and included CRNK in it, but when I get into my controller I do not get the expected JSON:API output.\r\n\r\n*Please keep in mind, I am just starting to look at CRNK and this is just a simple &quot;hello world&quot; type of application that I am testing with*\r\n\r\nHere is my example\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.crnkdemo;\r\n\r\nimport org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@RestController\r\n@RequestMapping(&quot;/test/v1.0&quot;)\r\npublic class Controller {\r\n    @GetMapping(value = &quot;/{country}&quot;, produces = &quot;application/vnd.api+json&quot;)\r\n    public Country test1(@PathVariable String country, @RequestParam(name = &quot;filter[region]&quot;, required = false) String filter) {\r\n        return new Country(country, filter);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCountry is just a dummy class I created which is:\r\n```java\r\npackage com.example.crnkdemo;\r\n\r\nimport io.crnk.core.resource.annotations.JsonApiId;\r\nimport io.crnk.core.resource.annotations.JsonApiResource;\r\n\r\n@JsonApiResource(type = &quot;country&quot;)\r\n@AllArgsConstructor\r\n@Data\r\npublic class Country {\r\n\r\n    @JsonApiId\r\n    private String country;\r\n    private String region;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Results**\r\n\r\nBut when I use the following URL *http://localhost:8080/test/v1.0/US?filter[region]=northeast* I get\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n    &quot;country&quot;: &quot;US&quot;,\r\n    &quot;region&quot;:&quot;northeast&quot;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would have expected the JSON API type of result\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;country&quot;,\r\n    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;US&quot;,\r\n    &quot;attributes&quot;: {\r\n      &quot;region&quot;: &quot;northeast&quot;\r\n

The graph would contain all the nodes reachable from any of the starting node and all the edges seen on the way thanks to the `SuccessorsFunction`. (E.g., given starting node `{a}` and successors `a → b` and `b → c`, the resulting graph should be `{(a, b), (b, c)}`.)\r\n\r\nI see how I can obtain a [`Traverser`](https://guava.dev/releases/snapshot/api/docs/com/google/common/graph/Traverser.html) to explore the reachable nodes in a certain order, given starting nodes and a `SuccessorsFunction`, but it does not meet my needs as I want to obtain a graph, not just the nodes.\r\n\r\nIt is not very hard to define an algorithm that does this, but it’s subtle enough to deserve trying to re-use an existing solution.

I had Python 3.7.4 installed &amp; working great on Win10.  Then, a 3rd party installer (unbeknownst to me) installed Python 2.7...which completely hosed my Python environment (ugh).  After removing Python 2.7 and running a repair-reinstall of Python 3.7.4, it&#39;s mostly back up and running - except for the ability to drag and drop onto .py files.\r\n\r\nPer https://stackoverflow.com/questions/142844/drag-and-drop-onto-python-script-in-windows-explorer and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42818369/python-drag-and-drop-broken, I&#39;ve tried:\r\n\r\nregedit:\r\n\r\n    HKCR\\.py=Python.File (when I first checked, it was set to py_auto_file, so I did have to change this)\r\n    HKCR\\Python.File\\shell\\open\\command=&quot;C:\\Users\\xxx\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\Python\\Python37-32\\python.exe&quot; &quot;%1&quot;\r\n    HKCR\\Python.File\\shellex\\DropHandler= I&#39;ve tried {60254CA5-953B-11CF-8C96-00AA00B8708C}, {86C86720-42A0-1069-A2E8-08002B30309D}, and {BEA218D2-6950-497B-9434-61683EC065FE}\r\n\r\nWith the above changes, I was able to get Python to launch when dragging-and-dropping onto .py files, but sys.argv does not contain the filename (only argv[0] is set, not argv[1]).  Obviously I&#39;m restarting Windows Explorer between each test.  I&#39;ve spent the past several hours searching &amp; reading, but everything I&#39;ve found pretty much contains some variation of the 3 changes above.\r\n\r\nAny ideas why argv[1] would not be set when launching Python by dragging a file onto a .py script?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243263/python-3-x-drag-and-drop-broken-in-windows","title":"Python 3.x Drag-And-Drop Broken in Windows"},{"tags":["sql","arrays","json","postgresql"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570224332,"post_id":58243326,"comment_id":102858860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243262/how-can-i-select-records-that-match-a-value-in-a-json-field-array/58243326#comment102858860_58243326"},{"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":58108,"user_id":215752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/face3276756bf64319a7d1df0d194d5c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hogan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/215752/hogan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570224635,"post_id":58243326,"comment_id":102858921,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243262/how-can-i-select-records-that-match-a-value-in-a-json-field-array/58243326#comment102858921_58243326"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9036933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nhFm6_6_3QI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAExk/UxD-G1zOIMU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ramarc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9036933/ramarc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570229403,"post_id":58243326,"comment_id":102859958,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243262/how-can-i-select-records-that-match-a-value-in-a-json-field-array/58243326#comment102859958_58243326"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34448,"user_id":10676716,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/arsQA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"GMB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10676716/gmb"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570224513,"last_edit_date":1570224513,"creation_date":1570224265,"answer_id":58243326,"question_id":58243262,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243326","body_markdown":"You would need to use `-&gt;` instead of `-&gt;&gt;`.

tests, currently we&#39;re just going to verify that our desired versions for Python and NumPy are being used with `python --version` and `python -c &quot;import numpy; print(numpy.__version__)&quot;`. For the example above, at the end of the log you should find:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPython 3.5.5\r\n1.14.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nDepending on the versions you select, you might get an error:\r\n\r\n- If you get `PackagesNotFoundError`, you need to make sure that the selected channel has the package version you&#39;re looking for. (Like `conda-forge` is selected in the example above.)\r\n- If you get `UnsatisfiableError`, you have selected versions of the packages which aren&#39;t compatible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere is an example configuration for multiple versions:\r\n\r\n```\r\nversion: 2\r\n\r\nworkflows:\r\n  version: 2\r\n  test:\r\n    jobs:\r\n      - python_3.5\r\n      - python_3.6\r\n      - python_3.7\r\n\r\ntemplate: &amp;template\r\n  docker:\r\n    - image: ubuntu:bionic\r\n  steps:\r\n    - checkout\r\n    - run:\r\n        name: Setup Miniconda\r\n        command: |\r\n          apt update\r\n          apt install -y wget\r\n          cd $HOME\r\n          wget &quot;https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-4.7.10-Linux-x86_64.sh&quot;

to C#)\r\n\r\nI have an application that I have built that copies files and folders from one location to another. I originally had issues with folders. For some reason, it would try to copy the file over without creating the directory. I solved that by adding a second section to check if the folder exists and if not create it. I am sure there is a better way to handle this, but this is what worked, so I went with it. The ultimate goal is this. \r\n\r\n 1. check if the file/folder exists in the destination location and is older than the source file/folder\r\n 2. If the file/folder doesn&#39;t exist, copy it over. If the file/folder is older than the source, copy it over.\r\n 3. If the file folder exists in the destination and not in the source (indicating it was deleted) move the file from the destination location to an archive folder\r\n\r\nBelow is what I have so far, and it does everything but what is described in #3 above. Any ideas in regards to how I can add the ability from #3 into the functionality, or simplify the copy of files and create the folder if it doesn&#39;t exist would be much appreciated. \r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\r\nusing System.IO;\r\nusing System.Linq;\r\nusing System.Text;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n\r\nnamespace FileCopy\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static string dtnow = DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;mmdd_hhmm&quot;);\r\n        public static string watch_path = string.Empty;\r\n        public static string copy_path = string.Empty;\r\n        public static string final_copy_path = string.Empty;\r\n        public static string log_folder = @&quot;C:\\copylogs&quot;;\r\n        //public static string log_file = &quot;copy_log&quot;;\r\n        public static string log_file = Path.Combine(log_folder + &quot;\\\\copy_log&quot;

You get that for free with the `ListView` class.\r\n\r\nFirst, the change to the template:\r\n\r\nnote_detail.html\r\n\r\n    {% extends &quot;lekha/base.html&quot; %}\r\n\r\n    {% block content %}\r\n      {% for note in notes %}\r\n    \r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;list-group&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-detail&#39; note.id %}&quot; class=&quot;list-group-item list-group-item-action&quot;&gt;{{ note.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n      {% endfor %}\r\n    {% endblock content %}\r\n    {% block content2 %}\r\n        &lt;article class=&quot;media content-section&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;media-body&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;article-metadata&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;a class=&quot;mr-8&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;{{ object.author }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n              &lt;small class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;{{ object.date_created|date:&quot;F d, Y&quot; }}&lt;/small&gt;\r\n                {% if object.author == user %}\r\n                    &lt;a class=&quot;btn float-right btn-secondary ml-1 btn-sm&quot; href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-update&#39; object.id %} &quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                    &lt;a class=&quot;btn float-right btn-danger ml-1 btn-sm&quot; href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-delete&#39; object.id %} &quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                {% endif %}\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;h4 class=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;{{ object.title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n              &lt;hr&gt;\r\n            &lt;p class=&quot;article-content&quot;&gt;{{ object.content }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/article&gt;\r\n    {% endblock content2 %}\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd the change to the view:\r\n\r\nviews.py\r\n\r\n    class NoteListView(ListView):\r\n        model = Note\r\n        template_name = &#39;lekha/home.html&#39;\r\n        context_object_name = &#39;notes&#39;\r\n        ordering = [&#39;-date_created&#39;]\r\n\r\n\r\n    class NoteDetailView(DetailView):\r\n        model = Note\r\n\r\n        def get_context_data(self):\r\n            data = super().get_context_data\r\n            data[&#39;notes&#39;] = Note.objects.all().order_by(&#39;-date_created&#39;)\r\n\r\n\r\nOne last tip: to keep your HTML templates &quot;DRY,&quot; you should really extract the list of notes into a separate html template (often called a partial) that you can plug into multiple other templates. Your template setup would look like this:\r\n\r\npartials/all_notes.html\r\n    {% for note in notes %}\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;list-group&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-detail&#39; note.id %}&quot; class=&quot;list-group-item list-group-item-action&quot;&gt;{{ note.title }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n    {% endfor %}\r\n    \r\n\r\nhome.html\r\n\r\n    {% extends &quot;lekha/base.html&quot; %}\r\n\r\n    {% block content %}\r\n    {% include &#39;lekha/partials/all_notes.html&#39; %}\r\n    {% endblock content %}\r\n\r\nnote_detail.html\r\n\r\n    {% extends &quot;lekha/base.html&quot; %}\r\n\r\n    {% block content %}\r\n    {% include &#39;lekha/partials/all_notes.html&#39; %}\r\n    {% endblock content %}\r\n\r\n    {% block content2 %}\r\n        &lt;article class=&quot;media content-section&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;media-body&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;article-metadata&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;a class=&quot;mr-8&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;{{ object.author }}&lt;/a&gt;\r\n              &lt;small class=&quot;text-muted&quot;&gt;{{ object.date_created|date:&quot;F d, Y&quot; }}&lt;/small&gt;\r\n                {% if object.author == user %}\r\n                    &lt;a class=&quot;btn float-right btn-secondary ml-1 btn-sm&quot; href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-update&#39; object.id %} &quot;&gt;Update&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                    &lt;a class=&quot;btn float-right btn-danger ml-1 btn-sm&quot; href=&quot;{% url &#39;note-delete&#39; object.id %} &quot;&gt;Delete&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                {% endif %}\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;h4 class=&quot;article-title&quot;&gt;{{ object.title }}&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n              &lt;hr&gt;\r\n            &lt;p class=&quot;article-content&quot;&gt;{{ object.content }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/article&gt;\r\n    {% endblock content2 %}\r\n\r\n\r\nbase.html\r\n\r\n       &lt;main role=&quot;main&quot; class=&quot;container-fluid px-2&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-3&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;div class=&quot;content-section&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;h4&gt;Notes&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n                    {% block content %}{% endblock %}\r\n             &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-8&quot;&gt;\r\n                {% block content2 %}{% endblock %}\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/main&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243251/django-page-navigation-home-list-not-visible/58278511#58278511","title":"Django page navigation- home list not visible"}],"owner":{"reputation":175,"user_id":1195193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04418260f7e1b8ea5abf95731f74d574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"A.S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1195193/a-s"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570492657,"creation_date":1570223556,"question_id":58243251,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58243251","body_markdown":"I am super new to Dango; pardon me for a rookie question :)\r\n\r\nI am learning Django by creating a &quot;Note taking app&quot;.

Sadly, hibernate does not seem to find the necessary properties.\r\n\r\nDuring a study, I was challenged to save passwords securely in a given database. This part is deleted in the source code. (It happened not to be a problem, but other study members could be influenced.) I&#39;ve already tried to comment / uncomment the ManagedProperty annotations in AppController.java and AppUser.java in all possible combinations, but none of them seemed to lead me further to a solution. Only &quot;circular reference&quot; messages were added.\r\n\r\nMany other SE questions concerning the same issue seem to having neglected the correct naming of their getter or setter methods or the correct annotation syntax, but this seems not to be the problem in my case.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s my first use of hibernate, thus I&#39;m somewhat lost. (E. g., I do not know if the annotation must be set exactly before the declaration of the annotated variable.) The renaming of AppController.hbm.xml to Appuser.hbm.xml does not solve the problem either.\r\n\r\nI hope that the problem is easy enough to be seen by experts like you, since a complete minimal

The problem is that I then have to move to the next slide, select the text box, and run the macro again.\r\n\r\nIs there anyway to automate this so that the entire powerpoint gets edited by running the macro just one time?\r\n\r\nThank yoU!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243244/macro-to-resize-all-text-boxes-in-a-powerpoint-presentation","title":"Macro to resize all text boxes in a powerpoint presentation"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js","asynchronous","async.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3266,"user_id":10787900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Z6j7Qhowx8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-ighhCw1JxvK6l7ZVG0ZYElO2DSUA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bibberty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10787900/bibberty"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570223810,"post_id":58243239,"comment_id":102858715,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243239/how-do-i-return-values-from-an-async-each-function#comment102858715_58243239"},{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9926982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hThPQFWvW64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2M39oUr3VN9Cnef5hb22LQcdIXdw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926982/brian"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3266,"user_id":10787900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Z6j7Qhowx8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-ighhCw1JxvK6l7ZVG0ZYElO2DSUA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bibberty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10787900/bibberty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570224044,"post_id":58243239,"comment_id":102858789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243239/how-do-i-return-values-from-an-async-each-function#comment102858789_58243239"},{"owner":{"reputation":3266,"user_id":10787900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Z6j7Qhowx8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-ighhCw1JxvK6l7ZVG0ZYElO2DSUA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bibberty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10787900/bibberty"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570224599,"post_id":58243239,"comment_id":102858911,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243239/how-do-i-return-values-from-an-async-each-function#comment102858911_58243239"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":9926982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hThPQFWvW64/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq2M39oUr3VN9Cnef5hb22LQcdIXdw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926982/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570280191,"post_id":58243323,"comment_id":102867747,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243239/how-do-i-return-values-from-an-async-each-function/58243323#comment102867747_58243323"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3266,"user_id":10787900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-4Z6j7Qhowx8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-ighhCw1JxvK6l7ZVG0ZYElO2DSUA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bibberty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10787900/bibberty"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570224242,"creation_date":1570224242,"answer_id":58243323,"question_id":58243239,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58243323","body_markdown":"Here we are using a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) \r\n\r\nThe `Promise` object is returned immediately and we perform our async code inside there. \r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const someFuncThatTakesTime = () =&gt;

If there is a better way to make an asynchronous loop, please let me know. \r\n\r\nOn ~line 8 there is a log statement `myDeviceData`.  This should be returning the data I want through a callback, but this log statement always comes back empty.  And since the other log statements show that the data is being formatted correctly, the problem must be with returning the data I need through the callback of `getDeviceData()`.  Presumably, the `callback(null, devicesDataArray)` should do this.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m not understanding how these async functions are supposed to work, clearly. Can someone please help me understand how I should get values from these async.each functions? Thank you.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI refactored the code to try and make it clearer and approach the problem better, and I have pinpointed where the problem is.  At the beginning the this function I define `devicesDataArray` as an empty array, and at the end I return the array.  Everything inside happens as it should, but I don&#39;t know how to tell the return to wait until the array isn&#39;t empty, if that makes sense,  Here is the new code:\r\n```\r\nlet getData = async function (devices) {\r\n  let devicesDataArray = []\r\n  for (let i = 0; i &lt; devices.length; i++) {\r\n    deviceRepo.findById(new ObjectID(devices[i]), async (err, myDevice) =&gt; {\r\n      if (err) {\r\n        console.log(err)\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(myDevice) + &#39;  ||  myDevice&#39;)\r\n      let deviceObj = await {\r\n        name: myDevice.name,\r\n        version: myDevice.version\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(deviceObj) + &#39;  ||  deviceObj&#39;)\r\n      await devicesDataArray.push(deviceObj)\r\n      console.log(JSON.stringify(devicesDataArray) + &#39;  ||  devicesDataArray after push&#39;)\r\n    })\r\n  }\r\n  console.log(JSON.stringify(devicesDataArray) + &#39;  ||  devicesDataArray before return&#39;)\r\n  return Promise.all(devicesDataArray)  // problem is here.\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAny help towards understanding this is appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58243239/how-do-i-return-values-from-an-async-each-function","title":"how do I return values from an async each function?"},{"tags":["graphql","graphql-js","graphql-subscriptions"],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":5544394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BCNRi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ggluta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5544394/ggluta"},"last_editor":{"reputation":26,"user_id":5544394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BCNRi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ggluta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5544394/ggluta"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570261264,"creation_date":1570223453,"last_edit_date":1570261264,"question_id":58243238,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58243238","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement a simple API with GraphQL.
