Now it does not. And the caret also doesn&#39;t appear.\r\n\r\nAny pointers?\r\n\r\nEDIT: The following code seems to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyMCD(wx.Dialog):\r\n    def __init__(self, parent, message, caption, choices=[]):\r\n        wx.Dialog.__init__(self, parent, -1)\r\n        self.SetTitle(caption)\r\n        sizer = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL)\r\n        self.message = wx.StaticText(self, -1, message)\r\n        self.clb = wx.CheckListBox(self, -1, choices=choices)\r\n        self.chbox = wx.CheckBox(self, -1, &#39;Select all&#39;)\r\n        self.btns = self.CreateSeparatedButtonSizer(wx.OK | wx.CANCEL)\r\n        #self.Bind(wx.EVT_CHECKBOX, self.EvtChBox, self.chbox)\r\n\r\n        sizer.Add(self.message, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)\r\n        sizer.Add(self.clb, 1, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)\r\n        sizer.Add(self.chbox, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)\r\n        sizer.Add(self.btns, 0, wx.ALL | wx.EXPAND, 5)\r\n        self.SetSizer(sizer)\r\n        self.Fit()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich was copied from an example.

That means if the key is the same, it is the same Project, and you will have a &quot;history&quot; of analyses and can compare parameters.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea of buildnumbers seems to be interesting, i recommend to use Branch names instead. There are currently two ways of doing this, for the first one, you need to have a SonarQube installation with a paid price. Than you are entitled to use the branch plugin. Which is actually the more superior way, because your project will show branches. The [sonarQube docs][1] are quiet helpful regarding this.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old/Deprecated way will create a new project per branch, which you can than compare. the property you need to set is `sonar.branch` and this will be automatically added to your project key. So if the project key is `Project` and the `sonar.branch` is set to `develop` your new project will have the key `Project:develop`. This parameter is deprecated, and i am not sure, how long it will stay in the system.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/branches/overview/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58105250/how-to-re-use-projects-in-sonarqube/58122391#58122391","title":"How to re-use projects in SonarQube"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12029274,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DFce-bfIXeY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rf3qPq2WUC2OPGn9pQh2t_KvgRUzQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ganesh Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12029274/ganesh-kumar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":714,"user_id":2738882,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c4a87b27b18de15d87de3b85a0dffa11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2738882","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2738882/user2738882"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569520963,"creation_date":1569439288,"last_edit_date":1569462850,"question_id":58105250,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58105250","body_markdown":"We have multiple repos and whenever the developer runs the sonarQube scanner through Jenkins job, it is creating one project with build number along with the date, is there anyway I can re-use the same project name ..?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndevelopers are running sonarQube reports through Jenkins jobs. \r\n```\r\nsonar.projectKey=portal1-sonar:1stiteration-${BUILD_NUMBER}\r\nsonar.projectName=SonarQube nodeJS portal1 Build : ${BUILD_NUMBER}_${BUILD_TIMESTAMP}\r\n```\r\nanyway, I can change and use same project name, whenever developer runs sonarQube.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58105250/how-to-re-use-projects-in-sonarqube","title":"How to re-use projects in SonarQube"},{"tags":["java","android","react-native","gradle"],"owner":{"reputation":2456,"user_id":756566,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":53,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d46603fb8d0a3a068ff4875b9c74421?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cecil Rodriguez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/756566/cecil-rodriguez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569439281,"creation_date":1569439281,"question_id":58105246,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58105246","body_markdown":"I am trying to install Pushwoosh into my React Native app, and I am getting the following error:\r\n\r\n         &gt;

I basically need a simple angular listener that stores the message in a variable, thats it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58105201/how-can-i-send-a-message-from-java-backend-to-angular-front-end-using-websocket","title":"How can I send a message from Java backend to Angular front end using websocket?"},{"tags":["xml","xmpp","ejabberd","strophe","converse.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":382,"user_id":211453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16e23ad799639e30ef87c145b6df84ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wojtek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211453/wojtek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569446777,"post_id":58105200,"comment_id":102604140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58105200/how-to-fetch-private-room-list-using-ejabberd-using-their-api-and-or-using-xml#comment102604140_58105200"},{"owner":{"reputation":65,"user_id":8340671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rgfoz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vitor Miranda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8340671/vitor-miranda"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":382,"user_id":211453,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16e23ad799639e30ef87c145b6df84ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wojtek","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/211453/wojtek"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569448395,"post_id":58105200,"comment_id":102604637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58105200/how-to-fetch-private-room-list-using-ejabberd-using-their-api-and-or-using-xml#comment102604637_58105200"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1545,"user_id":6039301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4YL6k.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Badlop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6039301/badlop"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569495885,"creation_date":1569495885,"answer_id":58115433,"question_id":58105200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58115433","body_markdown":"&gt; They are not public.

This is the post body.\r\n\r\nI am reading the file using:\r\n\r\n    String text = File.ReadAllText(filePath);\r\n\r\nHow can I get, from text, the 3 parts of the file?\r\n\r\nThe YAML section between `---`:\r\n\r\n    title: Welcome post\r\n    tags: [tech]\r\n    enabled: true\r\n\r\nThe intro section, between `---` and `***`:\r\n\r\n    This is the post intro.\r\n\r\nAnd the body

I have defined my model same as below:\r\n\r\n    def LSTM_Model():\r\n    \r\n    model = Sequential()\r\n    model.add(LSTM(units = 256, input_shape=(None, 528),\\\r\n                           return_sequences=False, stateful=True, batch_size = 1))\r\n    model.add(Dropout(0.4))\r\n    model.add(Dense(3, activation=&#39;softmax&#39;))\r\n    opt = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.00005, decay = 1e-6, momentum=0.9, nesterov=True)\r\n    model.compile(loss = &#39;categorical_crossentropy&#39;, optimizer = opt, metrics = [&#39;accuracy&#39;])\r\n    model.summary()\r\n    \r\n    return model\r\n\r\n Then I trained and tested the model:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n    def train_model(X, y, X_test, y_test, model):\r\n        np.random.seed(200)\r\n        epochs = 100\r\n        maxlen = 500\r\n    \r\n        \r\n        for epoch in range(epochs):\r\n            \r\n            mean_tr_loss, mean_tr_acc =[],[]\r\n            print(&#39;Epoch: &#39;, epoch + 1 )\r\n            \r\n            for sbj in range(X.shape[0]):\r\n                \r\n                video = X[sbj]\r\n                y_sbj = y[sbj,:]\r\n                y_new = y_sbj\r\n                nb_frame = video.shape[0]\r\n    \r\n                for count in range(nb_frame // maxlen +1):\r\n                    \r\n                    if count == nb_frame // maxlen :\r\n                        seq = video[count*maxlen + count:, :]\r\n    \r\n                    else:\r\n                        seq = video[count*maxlen+count : (count+1)*maxlen+count, :]\r\n                        seq = np.expand_dims(seq, axis=0)\r\n                        \r\n          #   &#39;&#39;&#39; Using train_on_batch &#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n                        \r\n                        tr_loss, tr_acc = model.train_on_batch(seq, np.array([y_new])) \r\n                        mean_tr_loss.append(tr_loss)\r\n                        mean_tr_acc.append(tr_acc)\r\n   \r\n    \r\n                print(&#39;Training on subject&#39;, sbj+1, &#39;done&#39; )\r\n                model.reset_states() \r\n    \r\n\r\n            print(&#39;accuracy training = {}&#39;.format(np.mean(mean_tr_acc)))\r\n            print(&#39;loss training = {}&#39;.format(np.mean(mean_tr_loss)))\r\n            print(&#39;___________________________________&#39;)\r\n            \r\n\r\n        \r\n            print(&#39;Testing....&#39;)\r\n            \r\n\r\n            mean_te_loss, mean_te_acc =[],[]\r\n        \r\n            for sbj_test in range(X_test.shape[0]):\r\n                \r\n                video_test = X_test[sbj_test]\r\n                y_new_test = y_test[sbj_test]\r\n                nb_frame_test = video_test.shape[0]\r\n                \r\n                for i in range(nb_frame_test // maxlen + 1):\r\n                    \r\n                    if i == nb_frame_test // maxlen :\r\n                        seq_test = video_test[i*maxlen + i:, :]\r\n                    else:\r\n                        seq_test = video_test[i*maxlen+i : (i+1)*maxlen+i, :]\r\n                        seq_test = np.expand_dims(seq_test, axis=0)\r\n                        te_loss, te_acc = model.test_on_batch(seq_test, np.array([y_new_test])) \r\n                        mean_te_loss.append(te_loss)\r\n                        mean_te_acc.append(te_acc)                \r\n                print(&#39;Testing on subject&#39;, sbj_test+1, &#39;done&#39; )\r\n                model.reset_states()   \r\n                 \r\n    \r\n\r\n            print(&#39;accuracy testing = {}&#39;.format(np.mean(mean_te_acc)))\r\n            print(&#39;loss testing = {}&#39;.format(np.mean(mean_te_loss)))\r\n\r\n \r\n        \r\n\r\nIn the above code I considered each video separately and then each video was divided to different frame sequences with length 500 (except last sequence frame for each video because the length of frames are not divisible by 500).

If the case is &quot;overfitting&quot; adding dropout layer should help which didn&#39;t.

problem is your initial value in state which is `data: &#39;&#39;`, a string value which will throw error during first render while executing `this.state.data.hits[0]`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue you can change your initial state to something like below\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    this.state = {\r\n      input : &#39;&#39;,\r\n      data: {\r\n        hits: []\r\n      ,\r\n      isloading: true\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n\r\n- You don&#39;t need to bind the method `fetchData` since it&#39;s called in same scope\r\n\r\nIf you remove this bind then you don&#39;t even need constructor and you can replace the whole constructor with below code\r\n\r\n```js\r\n    state = {\r\n      input : &#39;&#39;,\r\n      data: { hits: [] },\r\n      isloading: true\r\n    }\r\n

(Please see interesting comments below as to whether it is better to conditionally call the console.log() or to create an initial state that matches the data structure that you will be expecting.  This code does work, though some people prefer a different approach). \r\n\r\nThe render method is running before the data is fetched, so at that point, your data is equal to an empty string.\r\n\r\nYou can put a conditional statement, so that it only does a console.log() when the data has been stored:\r\n\r\n    render(){\r\n       return(\r\n          &lt;div&gt;\r\n           {\r\n              this.state.data &amp;&amp; this.state.data.hits &amp;&amp;  console.log(this.state.data.hits[0])\r\n            }\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is no this.state.data, the code will not go past the next &amp;&amp; operator. But you need to also check if the data object has a &quot;hits&quot; property, so you write another &amp;&amp; operator for this.

having an issue while testing Rest request. \r\nHowever test is being **intercepted** by one of my interceptors. \r\n\r\nIn short I want to *mock* interceptors behaviour rather than calling actual implementation. \r\n\r\nFor simplicity purposes to visualise the issue here is a simply Get request\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Controller\r\npublic class HiController {\r\n\r\n    @ResponseBody\r\n    @GetMapping(value = &quot;/hi&quot;, produces = {&quot;application/json&quot;})\r\n    public String hi() {\r\n        return &quot;hi&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nwith simple interceptor and config file\r\n```\r\n@Component\r\npublic class LoggingInterceptor implements HandlerInterceptor {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public final boolean preHandle(HttpServletRequest request, final HttpServletResponse response, final Object handler) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Logging token interceptor&quot;);\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@Component\r\npublic class

addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {\r\n        registry.addInterceptor(loggingTokenInterceptor);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nthe purpose of test was to call rest endpoint and to mock interceptor\r\n```\r\n@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)\r\n@WebMvcTest(HiController.class)\r\npublic class HiControllerTest extends MvcTest {\r\n\r\n    @Autowired\r\n    private MockMvc mockMvc;\r\n\r\n

 public void mandatoryFieldMissing() throws Exception {\r\n\r\n        this.mockMvc.perform(get(AUTHENTICATE_USER))\r\n                .andExpect(content().string(containsString(&quot;hi&quot;)))\r\n
