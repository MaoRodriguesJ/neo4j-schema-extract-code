Or you can change the ordering, but it should be same in both UNION.\r\n\r\nHope this would help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387002/union-do-not-my-sql-column-results-for-odbc-query/58387083#58387083","title":"UNION do not my sql column results for ODBC query"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12199337,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCKtgj4sD9qHOcxou9z-6wEof52LMdQG2ee9mJyzA=k-s128","display_name":"Ayushi Mishra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12199337/ayushi-mishra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2316,"user_id":2164365,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RKSgV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Abra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2164365/abra"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571113155,"last_edit_date":1571113155,"creation_date":1571112560,"answer_id":58387103,"question_id":58387002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58387103","body_markdown":"Date is the third column in first part and 4th column in the second part.In union all the sequences of columns and the data type must be same.\r\n\r\nTry this and let me know if it works:\r\n\r\n    SELECT DIH_DBTNO as Debtor, JT_DES as Description, DIH_DATE as Date,\r\n\r\n\t\tCASE WHEN JT_TYPE=73 THEN JT_ITMNO\r\n\t\tWHEN JT_TYPE=76 THEN &#39;LABOUR&#39;\r\n\t\tELSE &#39;WORK SHEET&#39; END as Item,\r\n\r\n\t\tSUM(JT_AQTYHOURS) AS &#39;Qty&#39;,\r\n\t\tSUM(JT_ORDERTOTAL) AS &#39;Sales&#39;,\r\n\t\tSUM(JT_ACOST*JT_AQTYHOURS) AS &#39;Cost&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tFROM Debtors_Invoice_Header_File, Job_Master_File, Job_Transaction_File\r\n\t\tWHERE JOB_NO = DIH_JOBNO\r\n\t\tAND JOB_UNIQUE = JT_LINK\r\n\t\tAND JT_INVOICED &gt; 0\r\n\t\tAND JT_TYPE &lt;&gt;84\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DBTNO like ?\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DATE &gt;=?\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DATE &lt;=?\r\n\r\n\t\tGROUP BY DIH_DBTNO, JT_DES, DIH_DATE\r\n\r\n\t\tUNION ALL\r\n\r\n\t\tSELECT DIH_DBTNO as Debtor, DIL_DES as Description, DIH_DATE as Date,\r\n\t\t DIL_ITMNO as Item,\r\n\t\tSUM(DIL_QTYDEL) AS &#39;Qty&#39;,\r\n\t\tSUM(DIL_ORDERTOTAL) AS &#39;Sales&#39;,\r\n\t\tSUM(DIL_COST*DIL_QTYDEL) AS &#39;Cost&#39;\r\n\r\n\t\tFROM Debtors_Invoice_Header_File, Debtors_Invoice_Line_File\r\n\t\tWHERE DIH_LINK = DIL_DIHLINK\r\n\t\tAND DIL_TRANTYPE = 73\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DBTNO like ?\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DATE &gt;=?\r\n\t\tAND DIH_DATE &lt;=?\r\n\r\n\t\tGROUP BY DIH_DBTNO, DIL_ITMNO, DIL_DES, DIH_DATE\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58387002/union-do-not-my-sql-column-results-for-odbc-query/58387103#58387103","title":"UNION do not my sql column results for ODBC query"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12218115,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zYNzK5A5XFo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfVXy0FUNEjiAGKl3pdkQeJRl71BA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jon mather","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12218115/jon-mather"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571113155,"creation_date":1571111594,"question_id":58387002,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58387002","body_markdown":"I have a SQL query where I am trying to add the Date to output into the column but it gives me the following error\r\n\r\n&gt; the type of the result columns of the queries in UNION do no match.

That might be a lot of work, but the presented approach should be suitable nevertheless.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386961/how-to-generate-all-combinations-of-assigning-balls-into-bins-including-empty-an/58389966#58389966","title":"How to generate all combinations of assigning balls into bins including empty and full assignments?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97677,"user_id":2586922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFMSx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Luis Mendo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2586922/luis-mendo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97677,"user_id":2586922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFMSx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Luis Mendo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2586922/luis-mendo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571208315,"last_edit_date":1571208315,"creation_date":1571131121,"answer_id":58391274,"question_id":58386961,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58391274","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a solution in __Matlab__, fully __vectorized__.

used to have this question few years ago and the reason is really simple. It&#39;s because of the &#39;Z&#39; character at the end of the date value, because for the .toLocaleDateString() function(given that you haven&#39;t specified parameters, here is more [info][1]) implies this value lies in the UTC+0 zone and for some kind of reason that is always throwing you one day a head.\r\n\r\n**Solution:**\r\nTo solve this you have many options, but maybe the simplest one is to format the date by yourself like this:\r\n\r\n    function lz(n){return n&lt;10 ? &#39;0&#39;+n : n}\r\n    var d = new Date(&#39;2019-01-01T00:00:00Z&#39;);\r\n    var formatted = d.getUTCFullYear()+&#39;-&#39;\r\n        + lz(d.getUTCMonth()+1)+&#39;-&#39;\r\n        + lz(d.getUTCDate())+&#39; &#39;\r\n        + lz(d.getUTCHours())+&#39;:&#39;\r\n        + lz(d.getUTCMinutes())+&#39;:&#39;\r\n        + lz(d.getUTCSeconds());\r\n\r\nOr you can use third-party libraries like [moment.js][2] which, by the way, is pretty popular.

is how it works base on [Laravel Many to Many Relationship Docs.][1]\r\n\r\n**First**\r\n\r\nYou need to create 2 `model` that you would like to have relationship.\r\n\r\n&gt; In your example you have **USER** and **PHONE** relationship.\r\n\r\nIn your **User Model** you need to declare the relationship like this:\r\n\r\n    public function phones() {\r\n      return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(Phone::Class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd In your **Phone Model** you can do like this:\r\n\r\n    public function users() {\r\n      return $this-&gt;belongsToMany(User::Class);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**SECOND**\r\n\r\nYou need to have 3 `migration` one is for the `user`, `phone` and also the `phone_user`. So it should be look like this.\r\n\r\n**Phone User Migration**\r\n\r\n    Schema::create(&#39;phone_user&#39;, function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n      $table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n      $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;phone_id&#39;)-&gt;index();\r\n      $table-&gt;unsignedBigInteger(&#39;user_id&#39;)-&gt;index();\r\n      $table-&gt;timestamps();\r\n    \r\n      $table-&gt;foreign(&#39;phone_id&#39;)-&gt;references(&#39;id&#39;)-&gt;on(&#39;phones&#39;)-&gt;onDelete(&#39;cascade&#39;);\r\n      $table-&gt;foreign(&#39;user_id&#39;)-&gt;references(&#39;id&#39;)-&gt;on(&#39;users&#39;)-&gt;onDelete(&#39;cascade&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&gt; Note: You don&#39;t need to have the unsignedBigInteger in both `user` and `phone` `migration`.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a `user list` and a `phone list` you can now assign the `phone` to the `user` like this:\r\n\r\n**Controller**\r\n\r\n    $user = User::find(1);\r\n    $phone = Phone::find(1);\r\n    \r\n    $user-&gt;phones()-&gt;attach($phone);\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/eloquent-relationships#updating-many-to-many-relationships","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386935/how-do-i-create-a-joined-table-in-laravel-migration/58387718#58387718","title":"How do I create A joined table in Laravel Migration?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12157778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-LwEqWe_E3pQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcXL6Kmah2lUUwbAi2ttrTHUlgtWA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sudesh Wong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157778/sudesh-wong"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571116988,"creation_date":1571111025,"question_id":58386935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386935","body_markdown":"I have a users table with the following columns with User model has one to many relationship with phone model.\r\n\r\n**create_users_table.php**\r\n\r\n    public function up()\r\n    {\r\n        Schema::create(&#39;users&#39;, function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n            $table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;string(&#39;name&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;string(&#39;email&#39;)-&gt;unique();\r\n            $table-&gt;timestamp(&#39;email_verified_at&#39;)-&gt;nullable();\r\n            $table-&gt;string(&#39;password&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;rememberToken();\r\n            $table-&gt;timestamps();\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen I have a phones table, which has a foreign key of user_id\r\n**create_phones_table.php**\r\n\r\n    public function up()\r\n    {\r\n        Schema::create(&#39;phones&#39;, function (Blueprint $table) {\r\n            $table-&gt;bigIncrements(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;integer(&#39;user_id&#39;)-&gt;unsigned();\r\n            $table-&gt;string(&#39;phone&#39;);\r\n            $table-&gt;timestamps();\r\n\r\n            $table-&gt;foreign(&#39;user_id&#39;)\r\n            -&gt;references(&#39;id&#39;)\r\n            -&gt;on(&#39;users&#39;)\r\n            -&gt;onDelete(&#39;cascade&#39;);\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n**My User Model**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    \r\n    namespace App;\r\n    \r\n    use App\\Phone;\r\n    use Illuminate\\Contracts\\Auth\\MustVerifyEmail;\r\n    use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\User as Authenticatable;\r\n    use Illuminate\\Notifications\\Notifiable;\r\n    \r\n    class User extends Authenticatable\r\n    {\r\n        use Notifiable;\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * The attributes that are mass assignable.\r\n         *\r\n         * @var array\r\n         */\r\n        protected $fillable = [\r\n            &#39;name&#39;, &#39;email&#39;, &#39;password&#39;,\r\n        ];\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * The attributes that should be hidden for arrays.\r\n         *\r\n         * @var array\r\n         */\r\n        protected $hidden = [\r\n            &#39;password&#39;, &#39;remember_token&#39;,\r\n        ];\r\n    \r\n        /**\r\n         * The attributes that should be cast to native types.\r\n         *\r\n         * @var array\r\n         */\r\n        protected $casts = [\r\n            &#39;email_verified_at&#39;

In context of modern common operating systems, each process has its own virtual memory space, with overlapping virtual addresses.\r\n\r\nThis address space is divided into pages for easier management (example size 4 KB). Each valid page can be in 3 different states:\r\n\r\n* not stored physically (assumed to be all 0). If process writes to this kind of page, it needs to be given a page of physical memory (by OS, see below) so value can be stored.\r\n* Mapped to physical memory, meaning some page-size area in computers RAM stores the contents, and they can be directly used by the process.\r\n* Swapped out to disk (might be a swap file), in order to free physical RAM pages (done automatically by the operating system). If the process accesses the page (read or write), it needs to be loaded to  page in RAM first (see above).\r\n\r\nOnly when virtual memory page is mapped to physical RAM page, is there something there. In other cases, if process accesses that page, there is a CPU exception, which transfers control to operating system. OS then needs to either map that virtual memory page to RAM (possibly needing to free some RAM first by swapping current data out to swap file, or terminating some application if out of all memory) and load the right data into it, or it can terminate the application (address was not in valid range, or is read-only but process tries to write).\r\n\r\nSame page of memory can also be mapped to several places at once, for example with shared memory, so same data can be accessed by several processes at once (virtual address is probably different, so can&#39;t share pointer variables).\r\n\r\nAnother special case of virtual memory use is mapping a regular file on disk to virtual memory (same thing which happens with swap file, but now controlled by normal application process). Then OS takes care of actually reading bytes (in page-sized chunks) from disk and writing changes back, the process can just access the memory like any memory.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nEvery modern multi-tasking general purpose operating system uses virtual memory, because the CPUs they run support it, and because it solves a big bunch of problems, for example memory fragmentation, transparently using swapping to disk, memory protection... They could be solved differently, but virtual memory is the way today.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPhysical memory is shared between processes the same way as computer power supply is shared, or CPU is shared. It is part of the physical computer.

So your mentioned expected output is off and misleading.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386892/get-top-values-based-on-compound-key-for-each-partition-in-spark-rdd/58387171#58387171","title":"Get top values based on compound key for each partition in Spark RDD"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":192,"user_id":8214840,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c4bd3e4cca02688fcac328a4f6fe304?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PIG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8214840/pig"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571120091,"creation_date":1571120091,"answer_id":58388265,"question_id":58386892,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58388265","body_markdown":"If you are open for dataframe , you can use `windows` function with `rank`\r\n\r\nInspired from [here][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n    import pyspark.sql.functions as f\r\n    from pyspark.sql import functions as F\r\n    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession\r\n    from pyspark.sql import Window\r\n    \r\n    spark = SparkSession.builder.appName(&#39;test&#39;).master(&quot;local[*]&quot;).getOrCreate()\r\n    \r\n    df = spark.createDataFrame([\r\n        (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, 9),\r\n        (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;aaa&quot;, 9),\r\n        (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;, 3),\r\n        (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;ddd&quot;, 9),\r\n        (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;qwe&quot;, 4),\r\n        (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;rty&quot;, 7),\r\n        (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;iop&quot;, 8),\r\n        (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;zxc&quot;, 1)], [&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;]\r\n        )\r\n    \r\n    w = Window.partitionBy(&#39;A&#39;).orderBy(df.C.desc())\r\n    df.select(&#39;*&#39;, F.rank().over(w).alias(&#39;rank&#39;)).filter(&quot;rank&lt;4&quot;).drop(&#39;rank&#39;).show()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    +---+---+---+\r\n    |  A | B | C|\r\n    +---+---+---+\r\n    | B1 | iop | 8|\r\n    | B1 | rty | 7|\r\n    | B1 | qwe | 4|\r\n    | K1 | e | 9|\r\n    | K1 | aaa | 9|\r\n    | K1 | ddd | 9|\r\n    +---+---+---+\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38397796/retrieve-top-n-in-each-group-of-a-dataframe-in-pyspark","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386892/get-top-values-based-on-compound-key-for-each-partition-in-spark-rdd/58388265#58388265","title":"Get top values based on compound key for each partition in Spark RDD"}],"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12082296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1bf572e7e281c78ad647d9e30e2573f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Samson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12082296/samson"},"last_editor":{"reputation":33,"user_id":12082296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1bf572e7e281c78ad647d9e30e2573f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Samson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12082296/samson"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58387171,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571141161,"creation_date":1571110626,"last_edit_date":1571141161,"question_id":58386892,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386892","body_markdown":"I want to use the following rdd\r\n```\r\nrdd = sc.parallelize([(&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, 9), (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;aaa&quot;, 9), (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;ccc&quot;, 3), (&quot;K1&quot;, &quot;ddd&quot;, 9),\r\n(&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;qwe&quot;, 4), (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;rty&quot;, 7), (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;iop&quot;, 8), (&quot;B1&quot;, &quot;zxc&quot;, 1)])\r\n```\r\nto get the output\r\n```\r\n[(&#39;K1&#39;, &#39;aaa&#39;, 9),\r\n (&#39;K1&#39;, &#39;ddd&#39;, 9),\r\n (&#39;K1&#39;, &#39;e&#39;, 9),\r\n (&#39;B1&#39;, &#39;iop&#39;, 8),\r\n (&#39;B1&#39;, &#39;rty&#39;, 7),\r\n (&#39;B1&#39;, &#39;qwe&#39;, 4)]\r\n```\r\nI referred to &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49713886/get-top-3-values-for-every-key-in-a-rdd-in-spark&gt;

np.allclose(loopy(), vector())\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, we can time this dummy example using ipython&#39;s `%timeit` magic due to laziness:\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; %timeit loopy()\r\n... %timeit vector()\r\n216 ms &#177; 2.57 ms per loop (mean &#177; std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n25.9 ms &#177; 1.08 ms per loop (mean &#177; std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo at least in this small example the vectorized version is 8 times faster. The actual speedup depends greatly on the size of your actual example. Although I&#39;ve tried implementing outliers properly (i.e. setting outliers to `np.nan` rather than extrapolating nonsense), I didn&#39;t thoroughly check all edge cases, so make sure you test the implementation for your real data (by comparing the loop with the new interpolator for a few typical cases).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf your question contains the real problem, i.e. a final array of shape `(40,40,6,6)`, then none of this work is worth any of your time (considering the very short runtimes), and you should just use the loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386891/vectorized-2d-interpolation/58514260#58514260","title":"Vectorized 2D interpolation"}],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":3443033,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bfd6578e70f3d6739c5d38d6a11a467?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3443033","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3443033/user3443033"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23002,"user_id":5067311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qjltV.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andras Deak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5067311/andras-deak"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"answer_count":1,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571848512,"creation_date":1571110613,"last_edit_date":1571794416,"question_id":58386891,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386891","body_markdown":"I am using SciPy&#39;s 2D interpolation function (`scipy.interpolate.interp2d`).

The contents of the .ply file is an (nx3) matrix corresponding to the x, y, z points, as well as another (nx3) that corresponds to the RGB information. The total number of points are well over 2 million (the lidar was mounted on top of a vehicle). I also have a set of stereo cameras the were mounted along side the LiDAR (one left, one right), of which I only have the camera intrinsic parameters. \r\n\r\nI am trying to replicate a formula found in several papers, which can be seen [here](https://home.isr.uc.pt/~cpremebida/files_cp/Road%20Detection%20Using%20High%20Resolution%20LIDAR.pdf), equations 2 &amp; 3. It is originally found in the [Kitti dataset](http://www.cvlibs.net/publications/Geiger2013IJRR.pdf) paper, equation 8. Basically, they are projecting a point cloud based on the cameras projection with the following equation: [where P is the projection matrix--containing the camera intrinsic parameters, R the rectifying rotation matrix of the reference camera, T_{cam}^{velo} the rigid boy transformation from lidar coordinates to camera coordinates, and T_{velo}^{imu}][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/NEBRQ.png\r\n\r\nI want to note that not all papers used the last parameter (T_{velo}^{imu}), and because I don&#39;t have the imu information I will omit that parameter. \r\n\r\nWhile I only have the camera intrinsic parameters, I am able to extract the camera rotation and translation by way of the [Essential matrix](https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_calib3d/py_epipolar_geometry/py_epipolar_geometry.html). Along with the data, I also have a file containing the yaw, pitch and roll (in degrees) of the camera and lidar at the time that the images where being taken. I know that I can extract a rotation matrix from these parameters, but I am not quite sure how to use them in this case, specifically to obtain the rigid body transformation from lidar to camera coordinates. I should also mention that I have the real world coordinates of the camera at the time each image was being taken (in x, y ,z coordinates).

a program that relies heavily on image manipulation in C# and I have encountered several different &#39;recommended&#39; ways to handle bitmaps and prevent access violation exceptions, but I still seem to run into access violation exceptions constantly and seemingly randomly for unknown reasons. I want to know if there is a &#39;best practice&#39; I can use to manage these bitmaps and prevent them randomly locking up.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, I&#39;ve basically just been fiddling with it until it magically starts working again, but I would like a better understanding of how these bitmaps keep getting locked and how I can handle them better. So far, approaches I have tried include locking the bitmap and manipulating the image bits, using &#39;using&#39; statements and FastBitmaps, and constantly cloning bitmaps. No matter what I do, I still seem to inevitably end up locking bitmaps and having to spend an hour and half randomly moving my &#39;using&#39; statements and then finding that my problem magically goes away.\r\n\r\nI firmly believe that, somewhere out there on the internet, there must be some kind of a standard or best practice to explain and prevent these seemingly random errors. \r\n\r\n\r\nHelp me stack overflow, you&#39;re my only hope\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: at the request of a commenter I&#39;ve included some of my code. The problem that I&#39;m having isn&#39;t a surface level bug that I&#39;m gonna solve by changing one line and I&#39;m not asking for my code to be fixed. If it helps, I have spent some time condensing the code I am presently wrestling with and including it below.

There are a couple of solutions though.\r\n\r\n## Changing Schema in Code and Resuming Streaming Query\r\n\r\nYou simply have to stop your streaming query, change the code to match the current schema, and resume it. It is possible in Spark Structured Streaming with data sources that support resuming from checkpoint. Kafka data source does support it.\r\n\r\n## User-Defined Function (UDF)\r\n\r\nYou could write a user-defined function (UDF) that would do this dynamic JSON parsing for you. That&#39;s also among the easiest options.\r\n\r\n## New Data Source (MicroBatchReader)\r\n\r\nAnother option is to create an extension to the built-in Kafka data source that would do the dynamic JSON parsing (similarly to Kafka deserializers). That requires a bit more development, but is certainly doable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386798/how-structured-streaming-dynamically-parses-kafkas-json-data/58391764#58391764","title":"How structured streaming dynamically parses kafka&#39;s json data"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12212167,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af975b8ee2e6f7d0f1778dbcef08dbef?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12212167/sin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":51425,"user_id":1305344,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/G1CaA.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jacek Laskowski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1305344/jacek-laskowski"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58391764,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571132767,"creation_date":1571109951,"last_edit_date":1571132767,"question_id":58386798,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386798","body_markdown":"I am trying to read data from Kafka using structured streaming.

If the target\r\n&gt; column&#39;s type is not correct, it&#39;s best to revisit where the DT was\r\n&gt; created and fix the column type there; e.g., by using colClasses= in\r\n&gt; fread(). Otherwise, you can change the column type now by plonking a\r\n&gt; new column (of the desired type) over the top of it; e.g. DT[,\r\n&gt; `RX_HOSP_SURG_APPR_2010`:=as.double(`RX_HOSP_SURG_APPR_2010`)]. If the\r\n&gt; RHS of := has nrow(DT) elements then the assignment is called a column\r\n&gt; plonk and is the way to change a column&#39;s type. Column types can be\r\n&gt; observed with sapply(DT,typeof) [... truncated]\r\n\r\nI tried different ways but I could not figure this out\r\n\r\n&gt; `str(data$RX_HOSP_SURG_APPR_2010)`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; logi [1:8671] FALSE FALSE FALSE NA NA NA ...\r\n\r\n&gt; `str(data.all$RX_HOSP_SURG_APPR_2010)`\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; &#39;haven_labelled&#39; num [1:129296] 0 0 NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\r\n&gt;  - attr(*, &quot;label&quot;)= chr &quot;Surgical Approach at this Facility 2010 and Later&quot;\r\n&gt;  - attr(*, &quot;format.spss&quot;)= chr &quot;F1.0&quot;\r\n&gt;  - attr(*, &quot;display_width&quot;)= int 23\r\n&gt;  - attr(*, &quot;labels&quot;)= Named num [1:7] 0 1 2 3 4 5 9   ..- attr(*, &quot;names&quot;)= chr [1:7] &quot;No surgical procedure of primary site&quot; &quot;Robotic\r\n&gt; assisted&quot; &quot;Robotic converted to open&quot; &quot;Laparoscopic&quot; ...\r\n\r\nAny advice will be appreciated.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386793/can-not-merge-in-dt-as-i-got-coerced-double-rhs-to-logical-to","title":"Can not merge in DT as I got Coerced double RHS to logical to"},{"tags":["xslt","xsl-fo"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4696,"user_id":4092205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yzgQs.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tony Graham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4092205/tony-graham"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571125959,"creation_date":1571125959,"answer_id":58389757,"question_id":58386792,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58389757","body_markdown":"You might want `{$Request.Data.Communication.AddressStructured.Sender.OrgId}` rather than `${Request.Data.Communication.AddressStructured.Sender.OrgId}`, otherwise read on...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nGetting from your source XML to PDF output is a two-step process (unless, that is, you author documents directly in the XSL-FO vocabulary).  The steps are:\r\n\r\n1. An XSLT transformation transforms your XML into XML in the XSL-FO vocabulary that an XSL Formatter understands\r\n1. An XSL Formatter formats the XSL-FO to make pages and outputs those pages as PDF, SVG, etc.\r\n\r\nThis graphic from the XSL 1.1 Recommendation (https://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#d0e147) tries to illustrate the process:\r\n\r\n[![XSL involves transformation followed by formatting][1]][1]\r\n\r\nThe XSLT stage has variables, but the XSL-FO stage does not. (You can write expressions for the value of (most) XSL-FO properties, but the expression language (see https://www.w3.org/TR/xsl11/#d0e5032) doesn&#39;t stretch to having variables.)\r\n\r\nSo, in your XSLT stylesheet, you would have something like:\r\n\r\n    {$Request.Data.Communication.AddressStructured.Sender.OrgId}.jpg\r\n\r\nwhere:\r\n\r\n- `$Request.Data.Communication.AddressStructured.Sender.OrgId` is a variable (or parameter) reference.  We don&#39;t have enough information to know how you&#39;d define the variable.\r\n- `{...}` is an Attribute Value Template (AVT) that is used when you want to evaluate an expression to generate some or all of an attribute value.\r\n\r\nThe output from the XSLT stage would include the literal string resulting from evaluating the expression, and the XSL Formatter will use the actual URL to locate the image correctly.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KTZmt.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58386792/can-i-include-a-variable-inside-a-src-attribute-of-an-xsl-fo-block/58389757#58389757","title":"Can I include a variable inside a src attribute of an XSL-FO block?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12217671,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73061a0a9fd893a9eac82aeec215df01?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shane O&#39;Dea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12217671/shane-odea"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58389757,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571125959,"creation_date":1571109869,"question_id":58386792,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58386792","body_markdown":"We have 60-odd images that we want to include, and want to insert them into a doc using a variable name in the src attribute.
