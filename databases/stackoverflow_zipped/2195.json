I tried encoding it but then it won&#39;t work as a link. \r\n\r\nBasically, user types some text inside a textbox and he may paste links in there too, I have a regular expression that catches user links and puts them into a href. Is this enough validation? Do I need to encode and escape characters? If yes then how? I used encodeURI and encodeURIComponent but they broke my link since you cant put that in href. \r\n\r\nFor example: User puts a message like &quot;hey, click on this link: &quot;https://www.youtube.com&quot; and this link too &quot;www.google.com&quot; and the links get taken out from a string and put into href. Just like in any messenger where you put a link in-between a message you can click it when you send it to a different user.

short answer is: you (probably) don&#39;t need to use API Gateway for either case.\r\n\r\nAPI Gateway, as the name suggests, is just a gateway. It takes a request (often HTTP) and forwards it to another location (a Lambda function, an EC2 instance, another AWS service, or another HTTP endpoint). This is great if you need users *who do not have an associated IAM role* to access AWS services.\r\n\r\nUsers who are authenticated through Cognito have an associated IAM role through the associated Cognito Identity Pool. Just give them access to the AWS services this way, no need to go through API Gateway. \r\n\r\nAWS services that need access to other AWS services don&#39;t need to go through API Gateway, they need to be given permission through their IAM role.\r\n\r\nIf for some reason you must use API Gateway for both your users and your services, make two API Gateways that point to the same resources that use different authentication methods.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018554/how-to-use-both-service-to-service-and-cognito-auth-for-api-gateway/58019114#58019114","title":"How to use both service-to-service AND Cognito auth for API Gateway"}],"owner":{"reputation":991,"user_id":677283,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YmyOl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Thomas Thorogood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/677283/thomas-thorogood"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58019114,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568928353,"creation_date":1568924999,"question_id":58018554,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018554","body_markdown":"I have a RESTful API being accessed via AWS API Gateway.

There exists plenty of documentation of how to do either, but not for how to do *both*.\r\n\r\nI have tried using unauthenticated Cognito federated identities to authorize *services*.

Again, there is no ambiguity:\r\n\r\n\r\n    def foo(a, b=2, /, *args, **kwargs): pass\r\n\r\nA curious thing on this new syntax: one is _allowed_ to pass named arguments to &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, but the named arguments will come up as key/value pairs inside &quot;kwargs&quot; - while the local variables &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; will be assigned the positional only arguments:\r\n```\r\ndef foo(a, b=2, /, *args, **kwargs): \r\n    print(a, b, args, kwargs)\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nIn [9]: foo(1, 2, a=3, b=4)                                                                                                                                               \r\n1 2 () {&#39;a&#39;: 3, &#39;b&#39;: 4}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas with the traditional syntax you ask about - `def foo(a, b=2, *args, **kwargs):` - one gets a TypeError if that is tried:\r\n```\r\nIn [11]: foo(1,2, a=3, b=4)                                                                                                                                               \r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nTypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)\r\n&lt;ipython-input-11-d002c7717dba&gt; in &lt;module&gt;\r\n----&gt; 1 foo(1,2, a=3, b=4)\r\n\r\nTypeError: foo() got multiple values for argument &#39;a&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018545/why-does-python-allow-args-after-keyword-arguments/58018872#58018872","title":"Why Does Python Allow *args After Keyword Arguments?"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":3369465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e83c0e9f5f3e8ba110296e47ea5b90a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"reklak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3369465/reklak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":3369465,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e83c0e9f5f3e8ba110296e47ea5b90a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"reklak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3369465/reklak"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58018872,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568987085,"creation_date":1568924960,"last_edit_date":1568928155,"question_id":58018545,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018545","body_markdown":"Example:\r\n\r\n    def foo(a, b=2, *args, **kwargs): pass\r\n\r\nWhy does this not result in a SyntaxError? *args will not catch additional non-keyword arguments because it is illegal to pass them after keyword arguments.\r\n\r\nFor python3.x the correct use of *args, **kwargs in this case looks like:\r\n\r\n    def foo(a, *args, b=2, **kwargs): pass\r\n\r\nThanks for any insights into this curious behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nThanks to Jab for pointing me to PEP 3102, which explains this behavior concisely.

If I use @Transient, it will not initialize a List of events and I have to do this manually or get weird errors. \r\n\r\n\r\nId like the domain entity to be a POJO(or POKO as I use Kotlin), so I do not want to have such annotations on the entity class.

Is this a good practice? \r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: \r\nI know in C# the Entity Framework allows creation of mapping classes outside of Entity classes with Configuration classes, which is a way better alternative than XML hell.

As it turned out, `const mwSize *mxGetDimensions(const mxArray *);` is the oldest version of the function, and the associated C header file (matrix.h) has the line `#define mxGetDimensions mxGetDimensions_800` to override the function with its newest version. Obviously, Python&#39;s ctypes doesn&#39;t check the C header file; so, it was left for me to sift through the header file figuring out which version of the function to use.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the proper behavior with `POINTER(c_size_t)` was obtained when I changed my code to:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    libmx = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(&#39;libmx.dll&#39;)\r\n    libmx.mxGetDimensions_800.restype = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_size_t)\r\n    libmx.mxGetDimensions_800.argtypes = [ctypes.c_void_p]\r\n\r\n    dims = libmx.mxGetDimensions_800(VAR)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, there you have it: Study the associated header file thoroughly if you are wrapping a 3rd-party dynamic/shared library.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018536/python-ctypes-misbehaves-when-a-c-function-returns-a-dynamic-array/58035383#58035383","title":"Python ctypes misbehaves when a C function returns a dynamic array"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":4516027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e0440c6004a10178a1b15ea69ae8aa9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4516027/kesh"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58035383,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569014976,"creation_date":1568924932,"question_id":58018536,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018536","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on Python wrapper classes for Matlab&#39;s dynamic libraries to read Matlab MAT files in Python, and I&#39;m encountering an odd behavior that I cannot explain from the ctypes interface.\r\n\r\nThe C function signature looks like this:\r\n\r\n```c\r\n    const mwSize *mxGetDimensions(const mxArray *);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `mwSize` is a renamed `size_t`, and `mxArray*` is an opaque pointer. This function returns the &quot;shape&quot; of the Matlab array. The returned pointer points to the size_t array, which is stored internally within mxArray object and is **not** null terminated (its size is obtained via another function).\r\n\r\nTo call this function from Python, I set up the library as follows:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    libmx = ctypes.cdll.LoadLibrary(&#39;libmx.dll&#39;)\r\n    libmx.mxGetDimensions.restype = ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_size_t)\r\n    libmx.mxGetDimensions.argtypes = [ctypes.c_void_p]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand after obtained `mxArray*` in `VAR`, I called:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    dims = libmx.mxGetDimensions(VAR)\r\n    print(dims[0],dims[1])\r\n```\r\n\r\n`VAR` is known to be 2-D and has a shape of `(1, 13)` (validated with a C program) but my Python code returns `(55834574849 0)` in c_ulonglong... Results are consistently garbage across all the variables stored in the test MAT file.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong? Other library calls using VAR seems be working properly, so VAR is pointing to the valid object. As stated above, mxGetDimensions() called in a C program works as expected.\r\n\r\nAny inputs would be appreciated!

However, the `catch(Error $e)` did not work, why?\r\n\r\nHere is the full class:\r\n\r\n        &lt;?php\r\n    \r\n    namespace StatCollector;\r\n    \r\n    function drools_request($data, $uid) {\r\n      try {\r\n        $db = _get_db();\r\n        $db-&gt;insert(&quot;requests&quot;, [\r\n          &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n          &quot;data&quot; =&gt; json_encode($data),\r\n        ]);\r\n      }\r\n      catch(Exception $e)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &#39;Error writing to database: &#39;,  $e-&gt;getMessage(), &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function drools_response($response, $uid) {\r\n      try {\r\n        $db = _get_db();\r\n        $db-&gt;insert(&quot;responses&quot;, [\r\n          &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n          &quot;data&quot; =&gt; json_encode($response),\r\n        ]);\r\n      }\r\n      catch(Exception $e)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &#39;Error writing to database: &#39;,  $e-&gt;getMessage(), &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function results_sent($type, $to, $uid, $url = null, $message = null) {\r\n      try {\r\n        $db = _get_db();\r\n        $db-&gt;insert(&quot;messages&quot;, [\r\n          &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n          &quot;msg_type&quot; =&gt; strtolower($type),\r\n          &quot;address&quot; =&gt; $to,\r\n          &quot;url&quot; =&gt; $url,\r\n          &quot;message&quot; =&gt; $message\r\n        ]);\r\n      }\r\n      catch(Exception $e)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &#39;Error writing to database: &#39;,  $e-&gt;getMessage(), &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function peu_data($staff, $client, $uid) {\r\n      try {\r\n        if (empty($uid)) {\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n        $db = _get_db();\r\n    \r\n        if (! empty($staff)) {\r\n          $db-&gt;insert(&quot;peu_staff&quot;, [\r\n            &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n            &quot;data&quot; =&gt; json_encode($staff)\r\n          ]);\r\n        }\r\n        if (! empty($client)) {\r\n          $db-&gt;insert(&quot;peu_client&quot;, [\r\n            &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n            &quot;data&quot; =&gt; json_encode($client)\r\n          ]);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n      catch(Exception $e)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &#39;Error writing to databse: &#39;, $e-&gt;getMessage(), &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function response_update() {\r\n      $uid = $_POST[&#39;GUID&#39;];\r\n      $url = $_POST[&#39;url&#39;];\r\n      $programs = $_POST[&#39;programs&#39;];\r\n      if (empty($uid) || empty($url) || empty($programs)) {\r\n        wp_send_json([&quot;status&quot; =&gt; &quot;fail&quot;,&quot;message&quot; =&gt; &quot;missing values&quot;]);\r\n        return wp_die();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      try {\r\n        $db = _get_db();\r\n        $db-&gt;insert(&quot;response_update&quot;, [\r\n          &quot;uid&quot; =&gt; $uid,\r\n          &quot;url&quot; =&gt; $url,\r\n          &quot;program_codes&quot; =&gt; $programs\r\n        ]);\r\n        wp_send_json([&quot;status&quot; =&gt; &quot;ok&quot;]);\r\n        wp_die();\r\n      }\r\n      catch(Exception $e)\r\n      {\r\n        echo &#39;Error writing to database: &#39;, $e-&gt;getMessage(), &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhy is the `try` and `catch` not working?

Libraries are autoloaded if configured correctly. \r\n\r\nAs we may find in the sources of Opencart. Autoload functions are used:\r\n\r\n    spl_autoload_register(&#39;library&#39;);\r\n    spl_autoload_extensions(&#39;.php&#39;);\r\n\r\nAnd the `library` function itself\r\n\r\n    function library($class)\r\n    {\r\n        $file = DIR_SYSTEM . &#39;library/&#39; . str_replace(&#39;\\\\&#39;, &#39;/&#39;, strtolower($class)) . &#39;.php&#39;;\r\n        if (is_file($file)) {\r\n            include_once(modification($file));\r\n    \r\n            return true;\r\n        } else {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\nSo to load your custom library:\r\n\r\n1. Create a `.php` file at `&lt;root&gt;/system/library`, in that case, we can give the following name - `superlibrary.php`\r\n\r\n2. Let&#39;s consider that our library class is a singleton. So in our file `superlibrary.php` let&#39;s define the simple class:\r\n\r\n          class SuperLibrary\r\n          {\r\n               private static $inst;\r\n               public static function getInstance()\r\n               {\r\n                   static::$inst = null;\r\n                   if (static::$inst === null) {\r\n                      static::$inst = new static();\r\n                   }\r\n                   return static::$inst;\r\n               }\r\n    \r\n               private function __construct()\r\n               {\r\n               }\r\n    \r\n               public function someMethod() {\r\n                   var_dump(&quot;HELLO WORLD&quot;);\r\n                   exit;\r\n               }\r\n          }\r\n\r\n3. Next, if you try to dump loaded classes, you won&#39;t find it in the list, because, we didn&#39;t use it anywhere in our code. Let&#39;s use it, for instance, in any controller:\r\n\r\n        $superLib = SuperLibrary::getInstance();\r\n        $superLib-&gt;someMethod();\r\n\r\n4. If everything is set up correctly you should see the dumped output of the method. \r\n\r\nI hope that helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018504/how-to-include-my-custom-library-in-opencart-3/58018740#58018740","title":"How to include my custom library in Opencart 3"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":12087494,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19d8fad2d8932897b14f921e61649807?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rosebelanger407","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087494/rosebelanger407"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58018740,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568962558,"creation_date":1568924733,"question_id":58018504,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018504","body_markdown":"I want to add a custom library to my store without adding `require` statements everywhere I need this library.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have the following class\r\n\r\n    class SuperLibrary {\r\n       function someMethod() {\r\n    \r\n       }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow can I include it without modifying framework files?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018504/how-to-include-my-custom-library-in-opencart-3","title":"How to include my custom library in Opencart 3"},{"tags":["selenium","xpath","css-selectors","frame","webdriverwait"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":619,"user_id":4744568,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/125cdb7d43927756913b920de016f420?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"pcalkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4744568/pcalkins"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568925661,"post_id":58018500,"comment_id":102440858,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018500/not-able-to-click-on-a-link-in-a-frame#comment102440858_58018500"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12092329,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iC1Wg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Achiver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092329/achiver"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568929131,"post_id":58018870,"comment_id":102441869,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018500/not-able-to-click-on-a-link-in-a-frame/58018870#comment102441869_58018870"},{"owner":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12092329,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iC1Wg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Achiver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092329/achiver"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568961943,"post_id":58018870,"comment_id":102448852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018500/not-able-to-click-on-a-link-in-a-frame/58018870#comment102448852_58018870"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12092329,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iC1Wg.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Achiver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092329/achiver"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569210755,"post_id":58018870,"comment_id":102508402,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018500/not-able-to-click-on-a-link-in-a-frame/58018870#comment102508402_58018870"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"last_editor":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568961896,"last_edit_date":1568961896,"creation_date":1568926815,"answer_id":58018870,"question_id":58018500,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58018870","body_markdown":"To `click()` on the element with text as **Deprecated** within the url http://demo.guru99.com/selenium/deprecated.html and again `click()` on the element with text as **Overview**, as the the desired element is within a `&lt;frame&gt;` so you have to:\r\n\r\n- Induce _WebDriverWait_ for the desired _frameToBeAvailableAndSwitchToIt_.\r\n- Induce _WebDriverWait_ for the desired _elementToBeClickable_.\r\n- You can use either of the following [Locator Strategies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48369043/official-locator-strategies-for-the-webdriver/48376890#48376890):\r\n -

x86, there is only one coherency domain.  Stores become visible to all other cores at exactly the same time, when they commit to L1d cache.  That along with MESI in general is enough to give us a total store order that all threads can agree on.\r\n\r\nA few ISAs (including PowerPC) don&#39;t have that property (in practice because of store-forwarding for retired store within a physical core, across SMT threads).  So `mo_relaxed` stores from 2 threads *can* be seen in different orders by 2 other readers in practice on POWER hardware.  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27807118/will-two-atomic-writes-to-different-locations-in-different-threads-always-be-see/50679223#50679223 \r\n (Presumably barriers on PowerPC block that forwarding.)\r\n\r\nThe ARM memory model used to allow this IRIW (Independent Reader Independent Writer) reordering, but in practice no ARM HW ever existed that did it.  ARM was able to strengthen their memory model to guarantee that all cores agree on a global order for stores done by multiple other cores.\r\n\r\n(Store forwarding still means that the core *doing* the store sees it right away, long before it becomes globally visible.

In both the x86 and ARMv8 architecture, it appears(no pun intended) that the memory models respect transitivity/cumulativity, i.e if CPU 1 sees stores by CPU0, and CPU2 sees stores by CPU1 that could only have occurred if CPU1 saw CPU0 stores, then CPU2 must also see CPU0&#39;s store. The examples i&#39;m referring to are example 1 and 2 in section 6.1 of Paul McKenney&#39;s famous paper(relevant albeit old, the same thing exists in his latest perf cook book, http://www.puppetmastertrading.com/images/hwViewForSwHackers.pdf). If i understand correctly, x86 uses store queue&#39;s(or store order buffers) to order the stores(and for other micro arch optimizations)before they become globally visible(ie written to L1D). My question is how does the x86 arch(and other arch&#39;s) implement(micro-architecturally) the transitivity property ? The store queue ensures that the particular CPU&#39;s stores are made visible globally in a particular order, but what ensures the ordering of stores made by one CPU ordered with stores made by different CPU&#39;s ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018486/how-is-the-transitivity-cumulativity-property-of-memory-barriers-implemented-mic","title":"How is the

Filter loops over all elements in an array, and if they meet the condition they get added to the return value. The only argument you pass it is the function which will be called on each element. The function must return True or False for each member of the array.\r\n\r\nArray.Some() is similar, but instead of returning a copy of all the elements that meet the condition, it will check the condition on each element, and if any return True, Array.Some() will return True. Its an elaborate way to check if any elements meet your condition, like a giant OR block.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    students = [{\r\n        batch_id: 22,\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        image: null,\r\n        name: &quot;a new batch student&quot;,\r\n        attendance: [{\r\n            id: 1,\r\n            student_id: 1,\r\n            batch_id: 22,\r\n            absent_on: &quot;2019-09-15&quot;,\r\n            time: &quot;09:26:23&quot;\r\n          },\r\n          {\r\n            id: 9,\r\n            student_id: 1,\r\n            batch_id: 22,\r\n            absent_on: &quot;2019-09-19&quot;,\r\n            time: &quot;00:00:00&quot;\r\n          }\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        batch_id: 22,\r\n        id: 2,\r\n        image: null,\r\n        name: &quot;a new batch student&quot;,\r\n        attendance: [{\r\n          id: 9,\r\n          student_id: 2,\r\n          batch_id: 22,\r\n          absent_on: &quot;2019-09-19&quot;,\r\n          time: &quot;00:00:00&quot;\r\n        }]\r\n\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        batch_id: 22,\r\n        id: 12,\r\n        image: null,\r\n        name: &quot;a new batch student&quot;,\r\n        attendance: []\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    // Return student if\r\n    //    student has an absence date\r\n    //       that matches this date\r\n    studentsAbsentOn = (students, date) =&gt;

Is there something to refresh or finalize a change? Maybe that helps to make mark work again after moving lines.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018464/emacs-lisp-make-region-selected-by-start-and-end-after-changing-buffer","title":"Emacs Lisp make region selected by start and end after changing buffer"},{"tags":["angular","firebase"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1405,"user_id":1604072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ol7j5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan Fein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1604072/dan-fein"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568938743,"post_id":58018463,"comment_id":102443818,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018463/get-the-sum-of-all-the-nodes-child-nodes#comment102443818_58018463"},{"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":12092407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-y4NXxrnrzG4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rciIUvqDrcxn-KblJzBebEKxbtuTQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abilash Jayanandan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092407/abilash-jayanandan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1405,"user_id":1604072,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ol7j5.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dan Fein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1604072/dan-fein"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569355249,"post_id":58018463,"comment_id":102568309,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018463/get-the-sum-of-all-the-nodes-child-nodes#comment102568309_58018463"}],"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":12092407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-y4NXxrnrzG4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rciIUvqDrcxn-KblJzBebEKxbtuTQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abilash Jayanandan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092407/abilash-jayanandan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":60,"user_id":12092407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-y4NXxrnrzG4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rciIUvqDrcxn-KblJzBebEKxbtuTQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Abilash Jayanandan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092407/abilash-jayanandan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1569354647,"creation_date":1568924462,"last_edit_date":1569354647,"question_id":58018463,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018463","body_markdown":"[![this is firebase data][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI want to get the sum of all the supply for each supplier using Angular\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nArray has value in the console but it does not pass to data in the barchart\r\n\r\nI tried various methods but still, it doesn&#39;t work\r\n\r\nI want the sum of supplies on y-axis(sum of the supply node in firebase) against the company name(which is suppliers node in firebase)\r\n\r\nIt is working fine for company names but not for the sum of the supply nodes \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport class SupplierListComponent implements OnInit {\r\n\r\n  constructor(private service : SuppliersService,\r\n    private dialog: MatDialog,\r\n    private router : Router,\r\n    private serv : SuppliesService,\r\n    private db :AngularFireDatabase) { }\r\n\r\n    listData: MatTableDataSource&lt;any&gt;;\r\n  \r\n    x:MatTableDataSource&lt;any&gt;;\r\n    supplyList : AngularFireList&lt;any&gt;;\r\n    displayedColumns: string[] =[`supName`,`compName`,`email`,`mobile`,`address`,`actions`];\r\n    supplierList :  string[] = [];\r\n    supplysumList : number[] = [] ;\r\n    arr : any[] = [];\r\n    sumsup : number = 0;\r\n    companyNameList: any[] = [];\r\n    key : string;\r\n\r\n    BarChart=[];\r\n    expandedElement : MatTableDataSource&lt;any&gt;;\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    @ViewChild(MatSort,{static: true}) sort: MatSort;\r\n    @ViewChild(MatPaginator,{static: true}) paginator: MatPaginator;\r\n    searchKey: string;\r\n    \r\n    ngOnInit() {\r\n    this.service.getSuppliers().subscribe(\r\n      list =&gt;

provided very sage advice in the comments, which I will summarise here:\r\n\r\n&gt; DO NOT, under any circumstances, type up event handlers manually.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; *not sure how to implement* - the only difference is that you get a Sh\r\n&gt; parameter holding a reference to the modified sheet. ....and it&#39;s\r\n&gt; useless, because you can already get that with Target.Parent. The one\r\n&gt; thing you need to worry about is implicit ActiveSheet references\r\n\r\nUse your VBA IDE (that view/application/window that you found your screenshot from). Open up the code for &#39;ThisWorkbook&#39;. At the top of that code window, you will see two drop-down boxes.\r\n\r\nSelecting &#39;WorkBook&#39; in the left dropdown and &#39;SheetChange&#39; in the right dropdown will automatically post this code:\r\n\r\n    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)\r\n    \r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nAs you can see `Target` is used, not `Source`, in the automated text. So most of your code is unchanged. As a side note, you could modify that to &#39;Source&#39; or &#39;FrostyTheSnowman&#39; (thanks - @MathieuGuindon) and then modify your code accordingly but why make extra work for yourself (see Note 1 at end). \r\n\r\n\r\n    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)\r\n        If Target.Cells.Count &gt; 1 Then Exit Sub\r\n            If Not Intersect(Target, Target.Parent.Range(&quot;L13:L5000&quot;)) Is Nothing Then\r\n                If IsDate(Target.Value) And Target.Value &gt; 0 Then\r\n                    targetRow = Target.Row\r\n                    offsetRow = Target.Offset(9, 0).Row\r\n                    Dim bIsNinthRow As Boolean\r\n                    Dim ModResult As Long\r\n                    bIsNinthRow = False\r\n                    ModResult = (targetRow - 13) Mod 9\r\n                    If ModResult = 0 Then bIsNinthRow = True\r\n                    If bIsNinthRow Then Call Mail_small_Text_Outlook(targetRow, offsetRow)\r\n                End If\r\n        End If\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see from the above, I only made one small change - that is qualifying one statement.\r\n\r\n            If Not Intersect(Target, Target.Parent.Range(&quot;L13:L5000&quot;)) Is Nothing Then\r\n\r\nI could have used the `Sh` Object as well (`Intersect(Target, Sh.Range(&quot;L13:L5000&quot;))`), however, type checking would be required for peace of mind.\r\n\r\nBut\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour current design has a small flaw - and that is in your helper function `Sub Mail_small_Text_Outlook(targetRow, offsetRow)`.\r\n\r\nYou pass two variants into the routine, you don&#39;t use these variants (which is currently a blessing for you) and we can&#39;t tell what they are meant to be. Importantly, though, your code uses a `ActiveCell` construct - but you cannot guarantee what the active cell will be when you call the code.\r\n\r\nYou have the bones here, define the exact range (or better yet, the actual value) that you want to use in your `Mail_small_Text_Outlook` and then use that. This makes the routine much more re-usable at a latter date rather then your current construct which relies on a hard coded offset.\r\n\r\n    Sub Mail_small_Text_Outlook(ByVal dataElement1 as String, ByVal dataElement2 as String) &#39;Meaningful names and types required, I am guessing.\r\n        Dim xOutApp As Object\r\n        Dim xOutMail As Object\r\n        Dim xMailBody As String\r\n        Set xOutApp = CreateObject(&quot;Outlook.Application&quot;)\r\n        Set xOutMail = xOutApp.CreateItem(0)\r\n        xMailBody = &quot;Hello&quot; &amp; vbNewLine &amp; vbNewLine &amp; _\r\n                  &quot;This client is now Committed &amp; Complete and ready for your attention&quot; &amp; vbNewLine &amp; vbNewLine &amp; _\r\n                  &quot;Renew As Is?&quot; &amp; vbNewLine &amp; _\r\n                  &quot;Adding Changing Groups?&quot;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        With xOutMail\r\n            .To = &quot;&quot;\r\n            .CC = &quot;&quot;\r\n            .BCC = &quot;&quot;\r\n            .Subject = &quot;Committed &amp; Complete&quot; &amp; &quot;  &quot; &amp; dataElement1  &amp; &quot;  &quot; &amp; dataElement2\r\n            .Body = xMailBody\r\n            .Display   &#39;or use .Send\r\n        End With\r\n        Set xOutMail = Nothing\r\n        Set xOutApp = Nothing\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nThis means a small change to your &#39;Change&#39; routine:\r\n\r\n    Private Sub Workbook_SheetChange(ByVal Sh As Object, ByVal Target As Range)\r\n        If Target.Cells.Count &gt; 1 Then Exit Sub\r\n            If Not Intersect(Target, Target.Parent.Range(&quot;L13:L5000&quot;)) Is Nothing Then\r\n                If IsDate(Target.Value) And Target.Value &gt; 0 Then\r\n                    Dim data1 as string, data2 as string\r\n                    data1 = Target.Offset(-4, -11).Value\r\n                    data2 = Target.Offset(-4, -9).Value\r\n                    If (Target.Row - 13) Mod 9 = 0 Then Mail_small_Text_Outlook(data1, data2)\r\n                End If\r\n        End If\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nI have also cleaned up some of the unnecessary lines - the extra declarations etc weren&#39;t wrong, but all those extra steps could be done simply in a single line as shown. If there is a design reason for every ninth row, then a simple one line comment can explain that to a future maintainer of the code.\r\n\r\nStandard comments\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAlways. *Always*. **Always**. ***Always***. Use `Option Explicit`.\r\n\r\n`Call` is obsolete and at one stage was noted in the VBA documents as being deprecated. It is unnecessary clutter.\r\n\r\nBe very wary of using `On Error` statements, especially for parts of code where you can control/validate the inputs and manage expected errors yourself. These can hide basic coding errors and you will spend hours looking for something when you don&#39;t get the right results, or - even worse - you will just accept wrong results without knowing that an error has occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote 1: With event handlers, what is important is that the number and types of parameters line up with the event description.

orders of the user in a recycler view and it works but if an user deletes an order, in the recycler view every order is getting added to the old ones because the data get changed in the method &quot;updateFirebaseBestellung&quot; and everything repeats...\r\nBut I dont know how i an change this because if I try to get the recieved data after the ValueEventListener it doesnt got any data.\r\nIs there a possibility to stop the ValueEventListener in the onDataChange Method?\r\nI hope you could unserstand my english

This problem can actually be solved by using a single `map` only - you split the row value (i.e. topicstring) by `;` so it gives you [key,value] pairs as [topic,count] and you populate the hashmap by those pairs adding up the counts. Finally you output the `date` key with all distinct keys accumulated in the hashmap together with their values.  \r\nThis way seems to be more efficient as well because the size of hashmap is not going to be larger than the size of the original row so the memory space consumed by mapper will be limited by the size of largest row, whereas in the flatmap solution, memory should be large enough to fit all those expanded rows\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018411/split-string-twice-and-reducebykey-in-scala/58019730#58019730","title":"Split string twice and reduceByKey in Scala"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7410584,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2RhrBr3f6jM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJVQ/v6YMu8swnYs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"TheNumb3rMan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7410584/thenumb3rman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":57,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568994481,"creation_date":1568924208,"question_id":58018411,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58018411","body_markdown":"I have a .csv file that I am trying to analyse using spark.

Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. \r\n\r\n...is true.\r\n\r\nI suppose you could move `notify_user` to a `NotifyUserService` and do the rendering there. When I render in services, I do not have the `Render and/or redirect were call multiple times` problem.\r\n\r\nSo, you might do something like:\r\n\r\n    #app/services/notify_user_service.rb\r\n    class NotifyUserService\r\n\r\n      include ActsAsRendering\r\n\r\n      class &lt;&lt; self \r\n\r\n        def call(args={})\r\n          new(args).call\r\n        end\r\n\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      def initialize(args)\r\n        args.each do |k,v|\r\n          class_eval do \r\n            attr_accessor k\r\n          end\r\n          send(&quot;#{k}=&quot;,v)\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      def call \r\n        case notification_type\r\n        when :some_notification_type\r\n          html_body = render_partial(&#39;findings/added_finding&#39;)\r\n          subject = &quot;XXXXXXX.&quot;\r\n\r\n          project_notifications.each do |notification|\r\n            NotificationWorker.perform_async(html_body, notification.user, subject)\r\n          end          \r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n\r\n      def some_information\r\n        case notification_type\r\n          when :some_notification_type\r\n            &#39;some notification information&#39;\r\n          else\r\n            &#39;default notification information&#39;\r\n          end\r\n      end\r\n\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThen, in your controller, \r\n\r\n    def create\r\n      @finding = @findings.new(finding_params)\r\n      respond_to do |format|\r\n        if @finding.save\r\n          if @project_notifications.where(category: &quot;XXXXXXX&quot;).any?\r\n            NotifyUserService.call(\r\n              notification_type: :some_notification_type, \r\n              project_notifications: @project_notifications\r\n            )\r\n          end\r\n          flash[:notice] = &#39;Finding was successfully created.&#39;\r\n        else\r\n          helpers.show_errors_for(@finding)\r\n        end\r\n        format.html { redirect_back fallback_location: root_path }\r\n        format.js { head :no_head }\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThis, naturally, assumes that `NotifyUserService` knows how to `render`. I forget what the state of play is with rendering anywhere in the Rails 5/6 world is. But, to tell my services how to `render`, I have a module called something like `ActsAsRendering`:\r\n\r\n\r\n    #app/acts_as/acts_as_rendering.rb\r\n    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    # Use like: \r\n    #   include ActsAsRendering\r\n    #------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    module ActsAsRendering\r\n\r\n      module ClassMethods\r\n\r\n      end\r\n      \r\n      module InstanceMethods\r\n\r\n      private\r\n\r\n        def action_view\r\n          @action_view ||= new_action_view \r\n        end\r\n        \r\n        def new_action_view\r\n          av = ActionView::Base.new\r\n          av.view_paths = ActionController::Base.view_paths\r\n          av.class_eval do\r\n            include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers\r\n            include ApplicationHelper\r\n          end\r\n          av\r\n        end\r\n\r\n        def method_missing(meth, *params, &amp;block)\r\n          if action_view.respond_to?(meth)\r\n            action_view.send(meth, *params, &amp;block)\r\n          else\r\n            super\r\n          end\r\n        end\r\n\r\n        def render_partial(file_name)\r\n          file_name = file_name.to_s\r\n          render(partial: file_name, locals: {presenter: self})\r\n        end\r\n\r\n      end\r\n      \r\n      def self.included(receiver)\r\n        receiver.extend   ClassMethods\r\n        receiver.include  InstanceMethods\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll notice that I created a `render_partial` method and use that instead of `render`. The `render_partial` method passess the `NotifyUserService` instance in as a local. That way, in my views, I can do stuff like:\r\n\r\n    #app/views/findings/added_finding.html.haml\r\n    - @presenter = local_assigns[:presenter] if local_assigns[:presenter]\r\n\r\n    #some-document-id\r\n      .some-presenter-information\r\n        @presenter.some_information\r\n\r\nAnd now the view will show &#39;some notification information&#39; in the `html`. This way, I can push *all* view logic back into the presenter and my views become 100% logic free.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018400/calling-data-from-partial-within-controller-without-triggering-multiple-renders/58018501#58018501","title":"Calling data from partial within controller without triggering multiple renders/redirects"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1424,"user_id":1493116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9371f372f90b7c283579b097c67b9cd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LewlSauce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1493116/lewlsauce"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568931869,"post_id":58019003,"comment_id":102442552,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018400/calling-data-from-partial-within-controller-without-triggering-multiple-renders/58019003#comment102442552_58019003"},{"owner":{"reputation":5476,"user_id":4055042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd04c63d95d27033b53d4d83fea40c02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SRack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4055042/srack"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1424,"user_id":1493116,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9371f372f90b7c283579b097c67b9cd2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"LewlSauce","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1493116/lewlsauce"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568972641,"post_id":58019003,"comment_id":102454026,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018400/calling-data-from-partial-within-controller-without-triggering-multiple-renders/58019003#comment102454026_58019003"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5476,"user_id":4055042,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd04c63d95d27033b53d4d83fea40c02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SRack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4055042/srack"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568927617,"creation_date":1568927617,"answer_id":58019003,"question_id":58018400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58019003","body_markdown":"I&#39;m pretty sure you can use [`render_to_string`](https://apidock.com/rails/AbstractController/Rendering/render_to_string) for this use case:\r\n\r\n    def notify_users(notification_type)\r\n      if notification_type == 1\r\n        html_body = render_to_string(partial: &#39;findings/added_finding&#39;, layout: false)\r\n        subject = &quot;XXXXXXX.&quot;\r\n    \r\n        @project_notifications.each do |notification|\r\n          NotificationWorker.perform_async(html_body, notification.user, subject)\r\n        end\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThat way you&#39;ll get a stringified representation of your HTML to use elsewhere.

sparse\r\n\r\ndef matrix_power(data):\r\n    m = sparse.csr_matrix(\r\n        (\r\n        [np.int8(v) for row in data.values() for v in row.values()], (\r\n            [np.int32(row_n) for row_n, row in data.items() for v in row],\r\n            [np.int32(column) for row in data.values() for column in row]\r\n            )\r\n    ), dtype=np.int8)\r\n    print(&quot;matrix created&quot;)\r\n    m = m**3 #error occurs here\r\n    return m\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s expected to be `int8` for value but i get `int64` in error message (when i set `dtype=float` it works correctly even in error message)\r\n\r\nError Message : ```numpy.core._exceptions.MemoryError: Unable to allocate array with shape (125248475,) and data type int64```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nand if it&#39;s useful, the data is stored

note: \r\n\r\n 1. Too many requests or too quickly will result in server offering you random pages.\r\n 2. I cannot realistically test all pages so your mileage on other pages may vary.\r\n 3. There are several places that would benefit from error handling being added but that can be a development piece.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**tl;dr;**\r\n\r\nThe following expands and improves upon the linked answer, and the code in your question, to handle multiple numbers being present.\r\n\r\nThe code added begins with `GetDetails` and then the resultant call stack. It uses the same principle of combining keys and values for mapping the tel numbers parts from the css instructions. \r\n\r\nThe parts of the `::before` for keys obtained by regex `-(\\w+):before` (see highlighted rectangles in image below - 14 matches. The class mapping the actual elements comes from, for example, the `.icon-ji` and we only need the `ji` part for the dictionary key)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parts of the `::before` for values obtained by regex `9d0(\\d+)` (see highlighted rectangles in image below - 13 matches)\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subsequent subtraction of -1 from values to get the displayed digits on the page. Then the mapping of the first 13 into a dictionary followed by providing a hard coded 14 key value pair for the last key capture group\r\n\r\n    decodeDict(keys(UBound(keys))) = &quot;+&quot;\r\n\r\nIn order to determine how many telephone numbers are actually present, we extract the html for the telephone contact:\r\n\r\n    htmlToSearch = html.querySelector(&quot;.telCntct&quot;).outerHTML\r\n\r\nAnd then use regex to match on either first multi-class value of each child span or the character &quot;,&quot;. This is so we know where we need to split the decoded string to produce the required output numbers. \r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nNote, in this case there are 24 matches of which one will be the &quot;,&quot; between the contact numbers visible on the page:\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\nWe assume &quot;,&quot; is the delimiter between tel numbers and that `number of tel numbers listed = count of &quot;,&quot; + 1`.\r\n\r\nLooking back at the html for tel contact we can see that the `&quot;,&quot;` sits outside of child spans so would not have been returned from `querySelector/querySelectorAll` on parent (with parent html placed in another HTMLDocument so as to leverage these methods); furthermore, any attempt to use *next* syntax e.g. `nextSibling` wouldn&#39;t preserve the required ordering of output.\r\n\r\n `output` has our decoded string ready to chop into pieces e.g.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n\r\n25 characters long comprising the two numbers.\r\n\r\ngroups array values tell us where to split this string as we know whenever we find a &quot;,&quot; the next character is the start of the new number.\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, we loop the groups array and test the value at each position, use the position of each &quot;,&quot; in groups to determine the slicing up of the string into the output array of telephone numbers:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dim totalNumbers As Long, count As Long, results()\r\n        \r\n    totalNumbers = UBound(Split(htmlToSearch, &quot;,&quot;))\r\n    ReDim results(0 To totalNumbers)\r\n        \r\n    For i = LBound(groups) To UBound(groups)\r\n        If InStr(groups(i), &quot;,&quot;) &gt;

Sometimes, when I try to send `emails` I get the following errors:\r\n\r\n    Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL: Cannot assign requested address - connect(2) for &quot;host162.checkdomain.de&quot; port 587\r\n\r\nOR \r\n\r\n    SocketError: getaddrinfo: Temporary failure in name resolution\r\n\r\nFollowing are the `sidekiq` configurations in my application:\r\n\r\n    sidekiq_config = { url: ENV[&#39;REDIS_URL&#39;], password: ENV[&#39;REDIS_PASSWORD&#39;] }\r\n    Sidekiq.configure_server do |config|\r\n      config.redis = sidekiq_config\r\n    end\r\n    \r\n    Sidekiq.configure_client do |config|\r\n      config.redis = sidekiq_config\r\n    end\r\n\r\nWhen I try to send emails without using `sidekiq` I also got the same errors sometimes.  I am very confused about this issue because I am able to send emails successfully sometimes and sometimes this error occurs without changing anything. I contacted `digitalocean`(server provider) to make sure if all `smtp` ports are working fine and are not blocked by them.\r\nI have seen that this might be an issue due to enabling `IPV6` service over `digitalocean` which causes `smtp` to get blocked. I also have no `firewalls` enabled on my droplet.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, I have changed configurations of my droplet to prefer `IPV4` over `IPV6` for emails. I have uncommented the following line in `/etc/gai.conf` file and rebooted the system\r\n\r\n    #precedence ::ffff:0:0/96 100\r\n\r\nBut, sadly this also didn&#39;t help. I am now getting confused about what might be an actual issue to this problem. The only thing that I can try is disabling `IPV6` completely from my droplet manually as `digitalocean` does not allow this to do automatically. I am not sure if this will really be helpful or might have bad effect on the server because We can&#39;t bear a downtime for server or it might affect the domain or may cause the domain inaccessible. Sending `emails` is the most crucial part of our application currently I can handle it by retrying to send emails if a failure occurs but this is obviously not a good solution there is a possibility that email is not sent even after retrying many times. Please help me :/ ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58018386/errnoeaddrnotavail-cannot-assign-requested-address-connect2-for-mail-dom","title":"Errno::EADDRNOTAVAIL: Cannot assign requested address - connect(2) for &quot;mail.domain.de&quot;
