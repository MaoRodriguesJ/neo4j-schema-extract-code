One is hosting in the parent zone for the parent domain `contoso.com`, the other is hosting in the children zone for subdomain `sub.contoso.com`. It&#39;s convenient to manage the records when there are large records.\r\n\r\n&gt; The Domain Name System is a hierarchy of domains. The hierarchy starts\r\n&gt; from the &#39;root&#39; domain, whose name is simply &#39;.&#39;. Below this come\r\n&gt; top-level domains, such as &#39;com&#39;, &#39;net&#39;, &#39;org&#39;, &#39;uk&#39; or &#39;jp&#39;. Below\r\n&gt; these top-level domains are second-level domains, such as &#39;org.uk&#39; or\r\n&gt; &#39;co.jp&#39;. And so on. The domains in the DNS hierarchy are hosted using\r\n&gt; separate DNS zones. These zones are globally distributed, hosted by\r\n&gt; DNS name servers around the world.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; DNS zone - A domain is a unique name in the Domain Name System, for\r\n&gt; example &#39;contoso.com&#39;. A DNS zone is used to host the DNS records for\r\n&gt; a particular domain. For example, the domain &#39;contoso.com&#39; may contain\r\n&gt; several DNS records such as &#39;mail.contoso.com&#39; (for a mail server) and\r\n&gt; &#39;www.contoso.com&#39; (for a website).\r\n\r\nFor a normal DNS query process, the records in the parent zone could get answered prefer than the records in the children zone.

Later I created a subdomain (eg sub.contoso.com) to publish a new website hosted in an Azure VM. For this reason I created a CNAME record to link sub.contoso.com to the Azure VM&#39;s default DNS (something like xxxx.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com). It worked great but after few time I found this [guide][1] and, just for a test, I changed my DNS configuration as described by the guide (briefly, I created a new Zone DNS called sub.contoso.com and then I added the NS record in the contoso.com zone). It works but, since I need to create other two subdomains, this configuration seems too complicated and I prefer the previous one. But, and this is my question, I don&#39;t understand if the use of the CNAME record with respect to NS leads to some differences in terms of performance or security.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/delegate-subdomain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270917/subdomain-in-azure-dns-zone-cname-instead-of-ns","title":"Subdomain in Azure DNS Zone: CNAME instead of NS"},{"tags":["r","dplyr","transform","sequence","identifier"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":90996,"user_id":3962914,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/tGgv6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ronak Shah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3962914/ronak-shah"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570456191,"post_id":58270916,"comment_id":102908857,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270916/identifier-as-sequence-starting-with-1#comment102908857_58270916"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11416,"user_id":4552295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b47aeeacc995822fb34f3dbb8db8ecca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sindri_baldur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4552295/sindri-baldur"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11416,"user_id":4552295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b47aeeacc995822fb34f3dbb8db8ecca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sindri_baldur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4552295/sindri-baldur"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570457038,"last_edit_date":1570457038,"creation_date":1570456268,"answer_id":58270980,"question_id":58270916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58270980","body_markdown":"I believe the `tidyverse` solution would be something similar to:\r\n\r\n    da1$player &lt;- \r\n      da1 %&gt;% \r\n      group_by(player) %&gt;% \r\n      group_indices()\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to consider `data.table` and your data is ordered already you could do:\r\n\r\n    da1$player &lt;- data.table::rleid(da1$player)\r\n    &gt; da1\r\n      player wins\r\n    1      1    0\r\n    2      1    2\r\n    3      1    1\r\n    4      2    0\r\n    5      2    0\r\n    6      3    2\r\n    7      3    0\r\n    8      3    1\r\n\r\nOr all-the-way `data.table` solution (not sensitive to ordering):\r\n\r\n    setDT(da1)[, player := .GRP, by = player]\r\n    da1\r\n\r\nAnother `base R` alternative:\r\n\r\n    as.integer(factor(-da1$player))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270916/identifier-as-sequence-starting-with-1/58270980#58270980","title":"Identifier as sequence starting with 1"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":180,"user_id":11903913,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eUzDX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Schilker","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11903913/schilker"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570456356,"creation_date":1570456356,"answer_id":58271018,"question_id":58270916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58271018","body_markdown":"    da2 &lt;- transform(da1, id=match(player, unique(player)))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270916/identifier-as-sequence-starting-with-1/58271018#58271018","title":"Identifier as sequence starting with 1"}],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":10035626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-FPgAc-VDMKc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0UlmCdQZBprQ_WadubIUGrqcxmzw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Scijens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10035626/scijens"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570456295,"accepted_answer_id":58270980,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570457038,"creation_date":1570456069,"question_id":58270916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58270916","body_markdown":"I have an ID in my dataset indiciating the user whom the observation belongs to.

order to accomplish real-time performance to your dashboard, you would need to use Web Push notifications as the user @Dimu Designs claimed, or keep an open websocket connection between the client and your webapp. However, I&#39;m afraid that for the time being, none of these solutions are supported.\r\n\r\nThe only solution that&#39;s left would be to employ polling: The HTML served to the client would have Javascript code embedded to it that would set up a cron-like function that issues a request to your webapp every X seconds (see [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)) and updates your dashboard&#39;s content.\r\n\r\nBear in mind that this solution will involve sending many HTTP requests to your webapp, which will have the following downsides:\r\n\r\n1. An increased amount of bandwidth consumption.\r\n2. A non-real time dashboard, which will lag up to the X seconds determined to be the refresh rate.\r\n3. Upon sending a large number of requests in a short-time period, you may experience rate limitations.

But withTheme is not giving me my custom theme props. \r\n\r\nThis is my App.js\r\n\r\n    import { DefaultTheme,Provider as PaperProvider, Drawer, Avatar, withTheme } from &#39;react-native-paper&#39;;\r\n    import { createAppContainer,createSwitchNavigator } from &#39;react-navigation&#39;;\r\n    import { createDrawerNavigator } from &#39;react-navigation-drawer&#39; \r\n\r\n    const theme = {\r\n      ...DefaultTheme,\r\n      roundness: 8,\r\n      colors: {\r\n        ...DefaultTheme.colors,\r\n        primary: &#39;#ff0000&#39;,\r\n        accent: &#39;#000000&#39;,\r\n        text: &quot;#cc1111&quot;,\r\n        background: &quot;#000000&quot;,\r\n        contained: &#39;#000000&#39;\r\n      },\r\n      dark: true\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    class App extends Component {\r\n\r\n      render(){\r\n          return(\r\n            &lt;PaperProvider theme={theme}&gt;  \r\n               &lt;switchNavigator /&gt;\r\n            &lt;/PaperProvider&gt;\r\n          )\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    const switchNavigator = createSwitchNavigator({\r\n      Login: Login,\r\n      dranav: drawyerNavigator\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      initialRouteName: &quot;Login&quot;,\r\n      \r\n    })\r\n    export default  createAppContainer(switchNavigator);\r\n\r\nThis is my login.js\r\n\r\n    class Login extends Component{\r\n        state = {\r\n           emailtext: &#39;&#39;,\r\n           passwordtext: &#39;&#39;\r\n        };\r\n        componentDidMount() {\r\n            SplashScreen.hide();\r\n        }\r\n        render(){\r\n           const {navigate} = this.props.navigation;\r\n           const { colors } = this.props.theme;\r\n           console.log({colors.accent})\r\n       }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    export default withTheme(Login)\r\n\r\nIn my Login.js I was expecting &quot;colors.accent&quot; to give a value of my custom theme like this value -- &quot;#000000&quot;.\r\nBut it&#39;s giving me   = &quot;#03DAC4&quot; which is the default color for accent, not my custom color.\r\n\r\nI am using react-native version 0.61. please suggest what am I doing wrong. Also is there a better way to pass a react-native paper theme with navigation. I want a global theme for all screens\r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58270843/react-native-paper-theme-with-react-navigation-not-working","title":"React native

To generate a blob url with SAS token, please refer to [`Create an account SAS with .NET`][1].

To send a cloud-to-device message from IoTHub, please refer to [`Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub (Java)`][2].\r\n3. To receive the c2d message on a device, the REST API for all languages is [`Device - Receive Device Bound Notification`][3]. Or you can refer to the part of sample code [`SendReceive.java`][4] by searching the key word `D2C` to know how to retrieve messages from IoT Hub.\r\n4.

This ensures that you won&#39;t match, say `https://test.com/best-deals` or similar but *only* the URL that ends with `/deals`. Also, the final `/` is optional - you might get `https://test.com/deals`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, the regex allows for the URL to end with `#` anchors or `?` followed by parameters. The page might allow this right now or in the future - for example, if a link is used that leads to the same page (e.g. to a specific section), you&#39;d get a `#` added to the URL.
