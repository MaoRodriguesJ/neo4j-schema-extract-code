The requests are sent to backendpool within same Vnet. The backendpool is the IP of Istio `Ingress Gateway`!

However I tried to add rewrite set for the gateway to send the Host header but since the backendpool configured is internal vnet IP, It does not allow me to do add headers! I even try to add envoy lua filter on gateway to get `X-Original-Host` and set as `Host` but it does not work since the request does not even reach istio gateway. However Istio does not honour the `X-Forwarded-Host`.\r\n\r\nSo to make the long story short, I would like to send the Host headers from ApplicationGateway to Istio Ingress gateway What is the best way to do it! \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034363/how-to-send-azure-application-gateway-request-host-headers-to-istio-ingress-gate","title":"How to send Azure Application Gateway Request Host headers to istio ingress gateway(Azure Internal LB)"},{"tags":["vue.js","highcharts"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10148707,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dBx9i542Unw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAIA/jTmXXwIz6F4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gonzalo Alvarez Campos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10148707/gonzalo-alvarez-campos"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569242145,"post_id":58037896,"comment_id":102521531,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034359/how-to-make-this-table-or-how-to-stack-fix-columns-like-this/58037896#comment102521531_58037896"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5794,"user_id":10077925,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dLnp6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Wojciech Chmiel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10077925/wojciech-chmiel"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569047903,"creation_date":1569047903,"answer_id":58037896,"question_id":58034359,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58037896","body_markdown":"You can achieve it using `column-stacked` chart.

Here is the situation.\r\n\r\nI currently have the ability to check a directory for classes with a specific type. IE `class TabFrame(ttk.Frame)` will be loaded because it inherits specifically from `ttk.Frame`.\r\n\r\nI would rather be able to check if any of the classes in the directory contain a class attribute so I can be more specific on what class gets loaded.\r\n\r\nThe main issue is that I have no way of knowing all the names of the classes in the files in the directory. My current solution creates buttons for each file in the directory rather than the specific class I want to load.\r\n\r\nMy file that creates all the buttons based on file names in the directory that meet my criteria for valid filenames.\r\n\r\nSo the issue here is instead of buttons that are created for each valid file name I really need to create buttons for each valid class in each valid file name. I figured I could use a simple class attribute like `self.valid_class = True` as my control for what gets loaded as a button however I do not know how I can validate each class without directly importing them first.\r\n\r\nExample code you can use to test how it works:\r\n\r\n    import tkinter as tk\r\n    import tkinter.ttk as ttk\r\n    import os\r\n    import glob\r\n    import importlib.util as iu\r\n    from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile, join\r\n    \r\n    file_list = os.listdir(&#39;./ScriptFrames&#39;)\r\n    modules = glob.glob(join(dirname(&#39;.\\ScriptFrames\\\\&#39;), &quot;*.py&quot;))\r\n    __all__ = [basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f) and not f.endswith(&#39;__init__.py&#39;)]\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class ScriptManager(tk.Tk):\r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            super().__init__()\r\n            self.columnconfigure(0, weight=1)\r\n            self.tab_list = {}\r\n            top_frame = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            bot_frame = tk.Frame(self)\r\n            self.book = ttk.Notebook(bot_frame)\r\n            self.book.pack()\r\n            top_frame.pack()\r\n            bot_frame.pack()\r\n            for ndex, file_name in enumerate([x.split(&#39;.&#39;)[0] for x in file_list]):\r\n                if not any(substring in file_name for substring in [&#39;__&#39;, &#39;TaskFrame&#39;]):\r\n                    tk.Button(top_frame, text=file_name, width=30,\r\n                              command=lambda fn=file_name: self.add_tab(fn)).grid(row=ndex, column=0, padx=5, pady=1)\r\n    \r\n        def add_tab(self, file_name):\r\n            self.process_import(file_name)\r\n            self.add_frame_to_book(self.tab_list[file_name])\r\n    \r\n        def add_frame_to_book(self, frame_object):\r\n            self.book.add(frame_object, text=frame_object.tab_title)\r\n    \r\n        def process_import(self, fname=None):\r\n            if fname is not None:\r\n                for fn in __all__:\r\n                    if fn == fname:\r\n                        spec = iu.spec_from_file_location(&#39;ScriptFrames.{}&#39;.format(fn), &#39;.\\ScriptFrames\\\\{}.py&#39;.format(fn))\r\n                        modlst = iu.module_from_spec(spec)\r\n                        spec.loader.exec_module(modlst)\r\n    \r\n                        mod_itms = [getattr(modlst, item, None) for item in dir(modlst)]\r\n                        fc = [item for item in mod_itms if isinstance(item, (type,))\r\n                              and issubclass(item, (ttk.Frame, tk.LabelFrame))]\r\n    \r\n                        self.tab_list[fn] = fc[0]()\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        ScriptManager().mainloop()\r\n\r\nBase tkinter frame class used from a separate file.\r\nlocated in a folder in the main directory called ScriptFrames.

think what you&#39;re looking to do is pull in 20 different images, at random, from any user&#39;s sub-collection. That said, if you don&#39;t choose to use another structure and wish to have all of the data nested, you can opt for a collectionGroup query.\r\n\r\nThe bit on &quot;random&quot; is a bit tricky, and you may want to use some hacky ways to make it work. But starting with getting access to the various user&#39;s nested sub collections:\r\n\r\nAll of this data, regardless of user, lives in collections called `MyBooks` so you can run a `collectionGroup` query on `MyBooks`.\r\n\r\nThe way I would do it, with the random-image hacky bit would be, in partial pseudocode code to give you an idea (I confirmed collectionGroups in the Java SDKs):\r\n\r\n    usedImages = []\r\n    for numbers 0 to 19 {\r\n       let num = false\r\n       while (!num) {\r\n         let tempNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);\r\n         if (!( usedImages.includes(tempNum)){\r\n            num = tempNum\r\n         }\r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       var allBooks = db.collectionGroup(&#39;MyBooks&#39;).where(&#39;imageKey&#39;, &#39;==&#39;, num);\r\n         allBooks.get().then(function (querySnapshot) {\r\n            querySnapshot.forEach(function (doc) {\r\n            console.log(doc.id, &#39; =&gt; &#39;, doc.data());\r\n         });\r\n       });\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe idea with the code is to generate 20 random and unique numbers `num` (probably better ways to do it than what I hacked together above), and then take that number and look for all entries in `MyBooks` where that imageKey exists. This is the hacky way around the random image code, where you would need to add a globally unique ID to each of them.\r\n\r\nCollection Group doesn&#39;t specify a path of parent collections, so it allows you to look into all collections at once.\r\n\r\nIn the above pseudocode, you&#39;re running 20 collection groups queries.\r\n\r\nYou can find more on Collection Group queries here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries#collection-group-query","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034319/search-for-sub-document-value-in-firestore/58037017#58037017","title":"search for sub-document value in firestore"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":10403372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24656fae398b8c57b2adceb73e11ba23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"benb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10403372/benb"},"last_editor":{"reputation":52,"user_id":10403372,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24656fae398b8c57b2adceb73e11ba23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"benb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10403372/benb"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58037017,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569036088,"creation_date":1569008468,"last_edit_date":1569010844,"question_id":58034319,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034319","body_markdown":"I am using firestore database that has the following structure:\r\n\r\nI have collection named `NBDB`, inside there are documents with the `uid` of each user.

In other cases, use something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom numbers import Integral\r\n\r\ndef f(n):\r\n    if not isinstance(n, Integral):  # n ∈ ℤ, as implied by the question\r\n        raise TypeError(&#39;n must be an integer&#39;)\r\n\r\n    if 0 &lt;= n &lt;= 127:  # Literally 0 ≤ n ≤ 127\r\n        return n + 6\r\n    ...\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58034405#58034405","title":"python generate segment function"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":9008145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RqgI7My0ytQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/bJLxATi5s-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Abril","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9008145/nicolas-abril"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569015951,"post_id":58035366,"comment_id":102472774,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#comment102472774_58035366"},{"owner":{"reputation":24511,"user_id":32538,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8ueG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kirk Strauser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32538/kirk-strauser"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51,"user_id":9008145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RqgI7My0ytQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/bJLxATi5s-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Abril","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9008145/nicolas-abril"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569016776,"post_id":58035366,"comment_id":102472988,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#comment102472988_58035366"},{"owner":{"reputation":24511,"user_id":32538,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8ueG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kirk Strauser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32538/kirk-strauser"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":51,"user_id":9008145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RqgI7My0ytQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/bJLxATi5s-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Abril","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9008145/nicolas-abril"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569016898,"post_id":58035366,"comment_id":102473027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#comment102473027_58035366"},{"owner":{"reputation":3951,"user_id":4518341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eVuAv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wjandrea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4518341/wjandrea"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569021038,"post_id":58035366,"comment_id":102473777,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#comment102473777_58035366"},{"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":9008145,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RqgI7My0ytQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABo/bJLxATi5s-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Nicolas Abril","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9008145/nicolas-abril"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569263824,"post_id":58035366,"comment_id":102532427,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#comment102532427_58035366"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24511,"user_id":32538,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/u8ueG.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kirk Strauser","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/32538/kirk-strauser"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569014819,"creation_date":1569014819,"answer_id":58035366,"question_id":58034306,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58035366","body_markdown":"I think it&#39;s best to directly compare `n` to the numbers in each segment, like:\r\n\r\n    def f(n):\r\n        if 0 &lt;= n &lt; 128:  # n ∈ [0, 127]\r\n            return n + 6\r\n        elif 128 &lt;= n &lt; 896:  # n ∈ [128, 895]\r\n            return 2 * n + 1\r\n        elif 896 &lt;= n &lt; 1024:  # n ∈ [896, 1023]\r\n            return 4 * n + 6\r\n        else:\r\n            raise ValueError(&#39;n must be in range(0, 1024)&#39;)\r\n\r\n@wjandrea&#39;s answer is very good and there&#39;s nothing wrong with that at all, if you prefer that style. However, although `range.__contains__` is quick in Python 3, it still requires creating the `range` object and then discarding it afterward. That has a certain amount of overhead that the `if` expression doesn&#39;t have. Consider that somewhere in `range.__contains__` there&#39;s _still_ that same `if` expression, just with more wrapping around it.\r\n\r\n`timeit` bears that out:\r\n\r\n    &gt; python -m timeit &#39;200 in range(128, 896)&#39;\r\n    1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.387 usec per loop\r\n\r\n    &gt; python -m timeit &#39;128 &lt;= 200 &lt; 896&#39;\r\n    10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0521 usec per loop\r\n\r\nUsing `if x &lt;= n &lt; y` is about 7x faster than constructing a `range` object and querying it.\r\n\r\nBut we&#39;re generally not concerned about microbenchmarks, are we? We&#39;re talking about a few microseconds, so raw processing speed probably isn&#39;t the most important consideration here. For me, the bigger issue is that `if x &lt;= n &lt; y` explicitly describing exactly what you mean. Anyone familiar with math immediately understands exactly what that does. `range()` is not as immediately obvious to the non-programmer: does it include the right side of the interval, or does it not? It doesn&#39;t, but while you and I know that, the next person might lose time by having to look that up. It&#39;s not as explicit, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the intent of `range()` is to generate... ranges... that other things might consume. It has the very nice side effect of supporting efficient `n in range(...)` queries, but that&#39;s kind of a happy accident and not the reason it was designed in the first place. To me, it feels kind of wrong to use that as the primary feature of the object.\r\n\r\nAgain, there&#39;s nothing at all wrong with `range()`. If you love the way that looks, awesome! No one&#39;s going to yell at you for it. But -- in my opinion -- it&#39;s not the right tool for this job, as there&#39;s a simpler, faster, more explicit built-in alternative that was designed for exactly this sort of thing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function/58035366#58035366","title":"python generate segment function"}],"owner":{"reputation":4038,"user_id":1914781,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/466ea7ff3957320de91dd7a2bc0ad4f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"lucky1928","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1914781/lucky1928"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1569023654,"accepted_answer_id":58035366,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569072519,"creation_date":1569008421,"question_id":58034306,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034306","body_markdown":"What&#39;s the correct method to generate a segmented function with python?\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tEC4.gif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034306/python-generate-segment-function","closed_reason":"too broad","title":"python generate segment function"},{"tags":["file","import","rust"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1474,"user_id":6923555,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N8FUb3l8l44/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAio/1HlhcKxsTPo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rodrigo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6923555/rodrigo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569011585,"post_id":58034771,"comment_id":102471615,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034305/cant-import-a-file-into-another-file-in-rust/58034771#comment102471615_58034771"},{"owner":{"reputation":13061,"user_id":4253229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-e2FAQvlj5CQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/TlSnekirgNE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eugene Sh.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4253229/eugene-sh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1474,"user_id":6923555,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N8FUb3l8l44/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAio/1HlhcKxsTPo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rodrigo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6923555/rodrigo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569011648,"post_id":58034771,"comment_id":102471637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034305/cant-import-a-file-into-another-file-in-rust/58034771#comment102471637_58034771"},{"owner":{"reputation":882,"user_id":8050514,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XgQZN.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Optimistic Peach","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8050514/optimistic-peach"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1474,"user_id":6923555,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-N8FUb3l8l44/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAio/1HlhcKxsTPo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rodrigo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6923555/rodrigo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569018704,"post_id":58034771,"comment_id":102473398,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034305/cant-import-a-file-into-another-file-in-rust/58034771#comment102473398_58034771"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1922,"user_id":6797663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIMd6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codemonkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6797663/codemonkey"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1922,"user_id":6797663,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qIMd6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"codemonkey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6797663/codemonkey"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569012440,"last_edit_date":1569012440,"creation_date":1569011210,"answer_id":58034771,"question_id":58034305,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034771","body_markdown":"From the error message it looks like your addr.rs file is in the wrong place (src/addr.rs?).

One of the key elements is that when you type in an answer to a conjugation, it compares the input text with `String.startswith()`. This is great until the string has unicode characters. It seems that almost always the unicode characters that you input are different than the ones in the database. You can actually visually see in this node CLI example that the version I type in the &quot;ț&quot; character is literally a different character than the one in the database &quot;ţ&quot;.\r\n\r\nHere is an output of the typed input, it&#39;s value and unicode value vs. the comparison:\r\n```\r\ninput: anunț // anun\\u21B\r\ncomparison: anunţ // anun\\u163\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried things like `.normalize()` but it doesn&#39;t seem to affect either the inputted string, or the comparison string.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt; var input = &#39;anunț&#39;\r\n&gt; var comparison = &#39;anunţ&#39;\r\n&gt; input === comparison\r\nfalse\r\n&gt; input.normalize() === comparison\r\nfalse\r\n&gt; input.normalize() === comparison.normalize()\r\nfalse\r\n&gt; input === comparison.normalize()\r\nfalse\r\n/// etc etc with NFC, NFD, NFKC, NFKD forms\r\n&gt; input.normalize()\r\n&#39;anunț&#39;\r\n&gt; comparison.normalize()\r\n&#39;anunţ&#39;\r\n\r\n// i&#39;ve also tried .normalize() with the string decoded into unicode\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried converting to unicode and **manually** replacing one set of strings, but it only goes so far--- and brings up it&#39;s own bunch of issues --- including that sometimes when you type in the answer it will start to have issues doing a positive comparison until the entire string is entered.\r\n\r\nFinally I&#39;ve started to try regex comparisons, but I think this may also be another rabbit hole distraction.\r\n\r\nStripped down to it&#39;s most basic logic without any of the above attempts, this is the crux of what I am trying to do, for context:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (this.conjugation.startsWith(this.input)) {\r\n    this.status = &quot;correct&quot;;\r\n} else {\r\n    this.status = &quot;incorrect&quot;;\r\n}\r\n\r\nif (conjugation === val) {\r\n    // okay, we are done\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny thoughts of how I can get around this? I am currently testing this with Romanian verbs, so the characters appear to be in the following unicode ranges:\r\n\r\n`\\u0000-\\u007F`, `\\u0180-\\u024F`, `\\u0100-\\u017F`\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034300/cannot-always-successfully-use-string-startswith-when-string-contains-unicode","title":"Cannot always successfully use String.startsWith() when string contains unicode characters"},{"tags":["django"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":258,"user_id":8895630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBdU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jordan M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895630/jordan-m"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569009324,"post_id":58034298,"comment_id":102470919,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034298/how-do-i-add-image-to-object-in-python#comment102470919_58034298"},{"owner":{"reputation":338,"user_id":8702081,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a400502eb3a85e779dd22759e0273c9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Valachio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8702081/valachio"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":258,"user_id":8895630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBdU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jordan M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895630/jordan-m"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569011066,"post_id":58034298,"comment_id":102471468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034298/how-do-i-add-image-to-object-in-python#comment102471468_58034298"},{"owner":{"reputation":338,"user_id":8702081,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a400502eb3a85e779dd22759e0273c9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Valachio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8702081/valachio"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":258,"user_id":8895630,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EBdU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jordan M.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895630/jordan-m"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569011089,"post_id":58034298,"comment_id":102471477,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034298/how-do-i-add-image-to-object-in-python#comment102471477_58034298"}],"owner":{"reputation":338,"user_id":8702081,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a400502eb3a85e779dd22759e0273c9f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Valachio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8702081/valachio"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569008371,"creation_date":1569008371,"question_id":58034298,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034298","body_markdown":"Seemingly trivial question, but I&#39;m stuck.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to add add a photo to a model&#39;s `ImageField` when I create the model.

I can narrow down to the rows I know have issues and see the gap.

This was my attempt:\r\n\r\n        HTMLElement.prototype.findId = function(_id) {\r\n            var childs = this.childNodes;\r\n\r\n            for (var i = 0; i &lt; childs.length; i++) {\r\n                if(childs[i].nodeType == Node.ELEMENT_NODE) {\r\n                    if(childs[i].id == _id) {\r\n                        return childs[i];\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return null;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        // Usage Example\r\n        var parent = document.getElementById(&quot;scan-wrap&quot;);\r\n        var form = parent.findId(&quot;new_line_item&quot;);\r\n        parent.findId(&quot;new_line_item&quot;).setAttribute(&quot;data-remote&quot;, &quot;true&quot;);\r\n        form.findId(&quot;line_item_upc_code&quot;).setAttribute(&quot;accesskey&quot;, &quot;b&quot;);\r\n        form.bind(&quot;ajax:beforeSend&quot;, function(event,xhr,status){document.getElementById(&quot;line_item_upc_code&quot;).val(&#39;&#39;)});\r\n\r\nform.bind is not a function is the error I get and obviously it does not work.

To solve this problem:\r\n\r\n`for (k = 1; k &lt;= 2 * i - 1; k = k + 1);` remove the `;` from this line. **Why this solved the problem?**\r\n\r\nWhen there is a `;` after the loop, it means that the loop does nothing, and then the next three lines are:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        printf(&quot;O&quot;);\r\n    }\r\nWhich means that there are only a single `O` prints out, instead of printing it in a loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034280/how-do-i-prevent-command-line-closing-after-pressing-enter/58034317#58034317","title":"How do I prevent command line closing after pressing Enter"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":12097232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oD3h34PIbLc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/9ZprHA2M2So/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chinguun Erdenebadrakh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097232/chinguun-erdenebadrakh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569011223,"post_id":58034701,"comment_id":102471514,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034280/how-do-i-prevent-command-line-closing-after-pressing-enter/58034701#comment102471514_58034701"},{"owner":{"reputation":928,"user_id":6342463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/STRPB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jabberwock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6342463/jabberwock"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":111,"user_id":12097232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oD3h34PIbLc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/9ZprHA2M2So/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chinguun Erdenebadrakh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097232/chinguun-erdenebadrakh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569017724,"post_id":58034701,"comment_id":102473204,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034280/how-do-i-prevent-command-line-closing-after-pressing-enter/58034701#comment102473204_58034701"},{"owner":{"reputation":28409,"user_id":4142924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmZTf.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Weather Vane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4142924/weather-vane"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":111,"user_id":12097232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-oD3h34PIbLc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/9ZprHA2M2So/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chinguun Erdenebadrakh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097232/chinguun-erdenebadrakh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569086601,"post_id":58034701,"comment_id":102485376,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034280/how-do-i-prevent-command-line-closing-after-pressing-enter/58034701#comment102485376_58034701"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":928,"user_id":6342463,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/STRPB.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jabberwock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6342463/jabberwock"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569010770,"creation_date":1569010770,"answer_id":58034701,"question_id":58034280,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034701","body_markdown":"Apart from the semicolon after the `for (k = 1...` loop, you have no bug in this code; if Visual Studio closes, the issue is with that program.  (It could well just be closing because the program has finished execution, but I don&#39;t know that program).\r\n\r\nSince you write that you are a complete beginner and you would appreciate advice, I&#39;ll offer some stylistic comments.  But these are just comments on how I would do things differently if I were you, I am not saying that what you have is wrong.\r\n\r\n - Single-letter variable names: these will bite you.  It is really easy to mix up i, j, and k since they are all kind of meaningless indexes.  When your programs become more complex you will be happy to have meaningful variable names.  Also, if you are trying to locate instances of a variable, searching for &#39;i&#39; is a lot harder than searching for &quot;spaces&quot; or &quot;spc&quot;\r\n - Code block under scanf_s(): There is no reason to have this code inside a block--all that does is shift the internal code one tab right.  Screenspace is precious.\r\n - You will likely find it more useful to iterate from 0 than from 1, as you will be using your iterator variable as an array index a whole lot.  Getting into the habit of writing your loops as `for (dex = 0 ; dex &lt; max_val ; dex++)` will serve you well.  Note well that the comparison is &quot;dex &lt; max_val&quot; and not &quot;dex &lt;= max_val&quot;\r\n - The &quot;k = k + 1&quot; seems bad to me--people reading your code will need to stop and try to figure out why it&#39;s not just &quot;k++&quot; which what people are expecting and what you use in the other two loops.  (And even for incrementing-by-more-than-one I&#39;d expect something like &quot;k += 2&quot; not &quot;k = k + 2&quot;)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034280/how-do-i-prevent-command-line-closing-after-pressing-enter/58034701#58034701","title":"How do I prevent command line closing after pressing Enter"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9974,"user_id":1141537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f0c5bf8653be794a11259ea2ffd359f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Imran Rana","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1141537/imran-rana"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569017451,"creation_date":1569017451,"answer_id":58035667,"question_id":58034280,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58035667","body_markdown":"Once console application returns from main method, the associated console window closes automatically.

By aliasing tables it allows you to join tables in multiple times. Example a student has a term_address and a home address:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM\r\n      student s\r\n      INNER JOIN address ahome on s.home_address_id = ahome.id\r\n      INNER JOIN address aterm on s.term_address_id = aterm.id\r\n\r\nThis way you don&#39;t need a table for term addresses and a table for home addresses - the address table stores all addresses and you alias it differently. A different subset of records participates in each join\r\n\r\nAnything that represents a block of data can be aliased, be it a table or a subquery, or possibly some other things.\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM\r\n      (subquery here) aliasForSubquery\r\n      INNER JOIN\r\n      (anther subquery) aliasForANotherSubquery\r\n      ON\r\n        aliasForSubquery.column = aliasForAnotherSubquery.column\r\n\r\nThe only thing you don&#39;t need to(can&#39;t) alias is the subquery that creates your `IN(...)` list\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034261/how-can-i-join-two-unnamed-tables-selections-in-postgresql/58034347#58034347","title":"How can I join two &quot;unnamed tables/selections&quot; in PostgreSQL?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":48078,"user_id":10498828,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1360dd652f1e970ba098d1d5b63c14d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"forpas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10498828/forpas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569008813,"creation_date":1569008813,"answer_id":58034368,"question_id":58034261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034368","body_markdown":"You can use [cte][1]s:\r\n\r\n    with \r\n    cte1 as (\r\n    SELECT id, phone_number\r\n    FROM student\r\n    WHERE id IN\r\n        (SELECT account_id\r\n        FROM loan\r\n        WHERE id IN\r\n            (SELECT loan_id\r\n            FROM fine\r\n            WHERE paid_amount &lt; fine_amount))\r\n    UNION\r\n    SELECT id, phone_number\r\n    FROM administrator\r\n    WHERE id IN\r\n        (SELECT account_id\r\n        FROM loan\r\n        WHERE id IN\r\n            (SELECT loan_id\r\n            FROM fine\r\n            WHERE paid_amount &lt; fine_amount)\r\n    ),\r\n    cte2 as (\r\n    SELECT\r\n        account_id,\r\n        EXTRACT (&#39;day&#39; FROM (NOW()::timestamp - expiry_date::timestamp))\r\n    FROM loan\r\n    WHERE id IN\r\n        (SELECT loan_id\r\n        FROM fine\r\n        WHERE paid_amount &lt; fine_amount)\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM cte1 JOIN cte2\r\n    ON cte1.id = cte2.account_id;\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/queries-with.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034261/how-can-i-join-two-unnamed-tables-selections-in-postgresql/58034368#58034368","title":"How can I join two &quot;unnamed tables/selections&quot; in PostgreSQL?"}],"owner":{"reputation":104,"user_id":10660386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b899e9f1e6b7f04ffef3e60eb8b8591f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mooncow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10660386/mooncow"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58034347,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569009929,"creation_date":1569008182,"question_id":58034261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034261","body_markdown":"Given the tables `person` and `car` and a relationship based on `car.id` between the two tables, I could join them using the following code:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM person\r\nJOIN car\r\nON person.car_id = car.id;\r\n```\r\nHowever, I fail to figure out how to do this if I am working with two unnamed selections.

Any other ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034256/flutterweb-display-all-images-in-a-directory","title":"FlutterWeb - Display all images in a directory"},{"tags":["material-ui"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1147,"user_id":10641422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10641422/ido"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569012836,"creation_date":1569012836,"answer_id":58035066,"question_id":58034255,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58035066","body_markdown":"You can add your label as a direct child of the IconButton (sibling of the Icon itself), and override the IconButton-label style to have *flexDirection: column*\r\n\r\n    import React from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import {IconButton} from &#39;@material-ui/core&#39;;\r\n    import { makeStyles } from &#39;@material-ui/core/styles&#39;;\r\n    import SaveIcon from &#39;@material-ui/icons/Save&#39;;\r\n\r\n    const useStyles = makeStyles(theme =&gt;

Thanks in advance! I&#39;m sorry, this is my very first post, although I use stackoverflow for a long time! :)\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nI think I didn&#39;t explained properly. What I need:\r\n\r\nBUTTON A [data-tag=&quot;X&quot;, data-tag2=&quot;Y&quot;, data-tag3=&quot;Z&quot;]\r\nBUTTON B [data-tag=&quot;X&quot;, data-tag2=&quot;Y&quot;, data-tag3=&quot;Z&quot;]\r\n\r\nIt doesn&#39;t matter what button I hit, it&#39;s gonna open a MODAL with a form, but I need to keep those datas from the button pressed, to be inserted as a &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt; field, so I can get all the infos from the BUTTON pressed + all the infos from the form that opens on modal.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2 [SOLVED]:**\r\n\r\nI had 3 buttons for each product shown. One for ADD, one for MOVE and another one for REMOVE. After button clicked, a modal pops up with a form. As soon as you submit it, the JS responsible for opening the modal should get the data from this form, but it wasn&#39;t getting, until I found the solution to add something like this:\r\n\r\n    if (action === &quot;add&quot;) {\r\n      product_amount = modal.find(&#39;#amount1&#39;).val();\r\n    } else if (action == &quot;move&quot;) {\r\n      product_amount = modal.find(&#39;#amount2&#39;).val();\r\n      userToMove = modal.find(&#39;#userToMove&#39;).val();\r\n    } else if (action == &quot;remove&quot;) {\r\n      product_amount = modal.find(&#39;#amount3&#39;).val();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhere each #amount ID refers to the button pressed to open the modal.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for everyone who helped and I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t able to explain the issue properly due to my limitations with the language [english].

Those 500 publishers push messages basically into one queue and less often in the another one. \r\n\r\nRecently we had issue with spikes of stacked messages in all our queues. Numbers of stacked messages went from 1 to 1000. This spike was caused by decrease of consumer rate.\r\n\r\nI tired to find what happened and how to eliminate spikes in queues and I should limit queue length or eliminate connections. But we can’t limit we have to perform better. I took a look into RabbitMQ memory usage, cpu and same for consumers everything looks fine and RabbitMq was running around 50% on total load same for memory. Also consumers doesn’t seems to be a bottleneck because consume rate went event higher after the queue length grown.\r\n\r\nI have a couple of questions:\r\n\r\n- Is RabbitMQ designed for such a large amount of consumers?\r\n- I read that each queue is single threaded is it possible that rabbit just can’t handle 500 producers in one queue and throughput gets lower?\r\n- What else I can use to tackle the cause of lower consumer rate? Number of threads in Rabbit? \r\n- What do you recon to measure or test benchmark/performance of RabbitMQ server? \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ll5zO.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034208/decrease-consume-rate-on-rabbitmq-server","title":"Decrease consume rate on RabbitMq server"},{"tags":["ios","swift","uitableview","uicollectionview","delegates"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":98074,"user_id":205185,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1a313272e1f6a38fba49ff5323236b05?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Duncan C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/205185/duncan-c"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569008393,"creation_date":1569008393,"answer_id":58034301,"question_id":58034207,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58034301","body_markdown":"I wouldn&#39;t do it that way.

Please do not suggest how I can do this in XAML markup, unless you also explain how to do it entirely in code.\r\n\r\nThe property is &quot;UserSelectedPreFillFilePath&quot;, which you can see is of type &quot;ObservableString&quot;.\r\n\r\nObservableString Class looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Serializable]\r\n        public class ObservableString : INotifyPropertyChanged\r\n        {\r\n    \r\n            private string _stringValue;\r\n            public string StringValue\r\n            {\r\n                get { return _stringValue; }\r\n                set\r\n                {\r\n                    _stringValue = value;\r\n                    OnPropertyChanged(&quot;StringValue&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            public ObservableString() { }\r\n    \r\n            public ObservableString(string value)\r\n            {\r\n                this._stringValue = value;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            protected void OnPropertyChanged(string name)\r\n            {\r\n                PropertyChangedEventHandler handler = PropertyChanged;\r\n                if (handler != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    handler(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(name));\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;\r\n    \r\n        }\r\n\r\nA very simple class that holds a &quot;StringValue&quot; property and implements INotifyChange.\r\n\r\nSo then, I try to establish a two-way binding between this &quot;UserSelectedPreFillFileLocation&quot; and a text box on the main window.\r\n\r\nI want a two-way binding so that before I close down the application I can serialize the UserSelectedPreFillFileLocation property (which should be automatically updated based on what the user puts in the textbox in the window).\r\n\r\nThen when the application loads from a file (deserializes) that textbox is auto-populated with the UserSelectedPreFillFileLocation value via the binding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond to last thing, my converter class definition:\r\n\r\n    [ValueConversion(typeof(ObservableString), typeof(string))]\r\n    class ObservableStringToStringConverter : IValueConverter\r\n    {\r\n        public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\r\n        {\r\n            ObservableString myVar = (ObservableString)value;\r\n            return myVar.StringValue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public object ConvertBack(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, CultureInfo culture)\r\n        {\r\n            string myVar = (string)value;\r\n            return new ObservableString(myVar);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly here is the definition of the binding. The binding works target-to-source but not the other way around. I.E. when the user updates the textbox, UserSelectedPreFillFileLocation is updated, but not the other way around.\r\n\r\n            Binding UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding = new Binding();\r\n            UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding.Path = new PropertyPath(nameof(ThisAppsSerializableProperties.UserSelectedPreFillFilePath));\r\n            UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding.Source = ThisAppsSerializableProperties;          \r\n            UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding.Converter = new ObservableStringToStringConverter();\r\n            UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding.Mode = BindingMode.TwoWay;\r\n            UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding.UpdateSourceTrigger = UpdateSourceTrigger.PropertyChanged;\r\n            ThisAppInstanceMainWindow.TxtbxPrefillFileLocation.SetBinding(TextBox.TextProperty, UserSelectedPreFillFilePathBinding);\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034206/wpf-two-way-data-binding-to-textbox-text-only-working-in-one-direction","title":"WPF Two Way Data Binding to Textbox.Text only working in one direction"},{"tags":["kubernetes","autoscaling","amazon-eks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6859,"user_id":1663462,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c30e0fa0f3a065c038c633a95066d299?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Chris Stryczynski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1663462/chris-stryczynski"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569174415,"creation_date":1569174415,"answer_id":58051861,"question_id":58034203,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58051861","body_markdown":"I had the wrong parameters defined on the autoscaler:\r\n\r\nI had to modify the `node-group-auto-discovery` and `nodes` parameters.\r\n\r\n```\r\n        - ./cluster-autoscaler\r\n        - --cloud-provider=aws\r\n        - --namespace=default\r\n        - --scan-interval=25s\r\n        - --scale-down-unneeded-time=30s\r\n        - --nodes=1:20:terraform-eks-demo20190922161659090500000007--terraform-eks-demo20190922161700651000000008\r\n        - --node-group-auto-discovery=asg:tag=k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/enabled,k8s.io/cluster-autoscaler/example-job-runner\r\n        - --logtostderr=true\r\n        - --stderrthreshold=info\r\n        - --v=4\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034203/kubernetes-autoscaler-nottriggerscaleup-pod-didnt-trigger-scale-up-it-would/58051861#58051861","title":"Kubernetes autoscaler - NotTriggerScaleUp&#39;

You can pass all the extra arguments you want too.\r\n\r\n###EDIT after comments\r\nBe careful to not mix the arguments of your function with `apply` arguments, like `axis`. If your function takes more than one argument, you need to do:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;avg_vector&#39;] = df.apply(lambda row : avg_sentence_vector(row[&#39;names&#39;].split(), model=word2vec_model, num_features=300, ...), axis=1)\r\n\r\nwhere `...` stands for any other argument your function may require. All of them need to be inside the parenthesis of `avg_sentence_vector`, and axis=1 must be the last one.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034200/string-panda-series-to-string-variable/58034540#58034540","title":"String Panda series to string variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":363,"user_id":4538768,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/193e75d8ac32ee74d76e503a49388bf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Juan Perez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4538768/juan-perez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":363,"user_id":4538768,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/193e75d8ac32ee74d76e503a49388bf9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Juan Perez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4538768/juan-perez"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58034540,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569012682,"creation_date":1569007896,"last_edit_date":1569009382,"question_id":58034200,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034200","body_markdown":"Have been looking for the way to get a String variable from a string column in dataframe. In the most basic scenario, I have a String variable called name which is spplitted based on space to get a string list (in the example called names).

Then the third time one of them is clicked it works... and the fourth time it does not.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s my code:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    $(function() {\r\n      $(&#39;a[data-modal]&#39;).click(function(event) {\r\n          $(this).modal({\r\n            modalClass: &quot;modal-quiz&quot;\r\n          });\r\n          return false;\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .flex {\r\n      display: -webkit-box;\r\n      display: -ms-flexbox;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      -webkit-box-orient: horizontal;\r\n      -webkit-box-direction: normal;\r\n      -ms-flex-direction: row;\r\n      flex-direction: row;\r\n      -webkit-box-pack: center;\r\n      -ms-flex-pack: center;\r\n      justify-content: center;\r\n      -ms-flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n      flex-wrap: wrap; }\r\n\r\n    .flex div.col {\r\n      background: #ffffff;\r\n      background: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #87afd4 100%);\r\n      background: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #ffffff 0%, #87afd4 100%);\r\n      background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffffff 0%, #87afd4 100%);\r\n      filter: progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.gradient( startColorstr=&#39;#ffffff&#39;, endColorstr=&#39;#87afd4&#39;,GradientType=0 );\r\n      border: 2px solid #0055a5;\r\n      box-shadow: 0 3px 4px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n      padding: 10px;\r\n      box-sizing: border-box; }\r\n\r\n    .flex div.col:first-child {\r\n      margin-left: 1%; }\r\n\r\n    .flex div.col h2 {\r\n      color: black;\r\n      font-size: 187.5%;\r\n      height: 80px;\r\n      display: block; }\r\n\r\n    .flex div.col img {\r\n      width: 100%; }\r\n\r\n    ul.links {\r\n      list-style: none;\r\n      text-align: center;\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      padding: 0; }\r\n\r\n    ul.links li {\r\n      padding: 20px 0;\r\n      border-bottom: 1px solid #5b80a2;\r\n      font-size: 120%; }\r\n\r\n    ul.links li:last-child {\r\n      border-bottom: 0 none; }\r\n\r\n    ul.links a:link, ul.links a:visited {\r\n      text-decoration: none;\r\n      font-weight: 700;\r\n      color: #0055a5; }\r\n\r\n    ul.links a:hover, ul.links a:active {\r\n      color: #fff; }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;head&gt;\r\n            &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge,chrome=1&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;title&gt;Modal test&lt;/title&gt;\r\n            &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;/head&gt;\r\n        &lt;body&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;main class=&quot;span_10_of_12&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;section group flex&quot;&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;col span_4_of_12&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h2&gt;Training 1&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n            &lt;ul class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;video-1.html&quot; rel=&quot;modal:open&quot;&gt; Watch video course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;quiz-1.html&quot; data-modal&gt; Test your knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n        \t&lt;div class=&quot;col span_4_of_12&quot;&gt;\r\n          \t&lt;h2&gt;Training 2&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n            &lt;ul class=&quot;links&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;video-2.html&quot; rel=&quot;modal:open&quot;&gt; Watch video course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n              &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;quiz-2.html&quot; data-modal&gt; Test your knowledge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;/main&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.0.0/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n             &lt;!-- jQuery Modal --&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-modal/0.9.1/jquery.modal.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery-modal/0.9.1/jquery.modal.min.css&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n         &lt;/body&gt;\r\n     &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas why the ```data-modal``` modal is giving an error?

am writing a bit of TypeScript that attempt to download multiple files from Azure, then zip them on the client and download the zip; however, my `GET` requests to download the files are being blocked by CORS.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is, the pre-flight response returns status code 200 (OK) and the correct `Access-Control` headers.\r\n\r\nThe code to attempt the file downloads:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst _downloadFile = (absolutePath: string): Promise&lt;Blob&gt; =&gt; fetch(absolutePath, {\r\n    credentials: &quot;include&quot;,\r\n    headers: {\r\n

&quot;Cache-Control&quot;: &quot;no-cache&quot;,\r\n        &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;*/*&quot;,\r\n        &quot;Origin&quot;: window.location.origin,\r\n    },\r\n    method: &quot;GET&quot;,\r\n    mode: &quot;cors&quot;,\r\n}).then((response: Response) =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(response);\r\n    return response.blob();\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe pre-flight request returns a status code of 200 (OK) with the following headers:\r\n```\r\naccess-control-allow-credentials: true\r\naccess-control-allow-headers: access-control-allow-headers,access-control-allow-methods,access-control-allow-origin,cache-control,content-type\r\naccess-control-allow-methods: GET\r\naccess-control-allow-origin: http://localhost:8080\r\naccess-control-max-age: 50000\r\ncontent-length: 0\r\ndate: Fri, 20 Sep 2019 19:15:19 GMT\r\nserver: Windows-Azure-Blob/1.0 Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0\r\nstatus: 200\r\nx-ms-request-id: ff499fd5-a01e-0040-7de7-6f8a94000000\r\nx-ms-version: 2014-02-14\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the response to the &quot;real request&quot; does not include any `Access-Control` headers and is blocked by CORS, with the browser printing the following error:\r\n```\r\nAccess to fetch at &#39;[url to my file]&#39; from origin &#39;http://localhost:8080&#39; has been blocked by CORS policy: No &#39;Access-Control-Allow-Origin&#39; header is present on the requested resource. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request&#39;s mode to &#39;no-cors&#39; to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Azure, I have the following CORS configuration:\r\n\r\nAllowed Origins: `http://localhost:5000,http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8081,http://localhost:8082`\r\n\r\nAllowed Methods: `GET, HEAD, MERGE, POST, OPTIONS, PUT`\r\n\r\nAllowed Headers: `*`\r\n\r\nExposed Headers: `*`\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nI think it may have to do with the fact that there is an &quot;endpoint&quot; configured in Azure which points to the blob storage origin, so the CORS headers are not being passed through. I&#39;m not too familiar with Azure so I&#39;m not sure how to configure this correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034177/cors-pre-flight-response-returns-200-ok-but-real-request-still-blocked","title":"CORS Pre-Flight Response Returns 200 (OK) But Real Request Still Blocked"},{"tags":["powerbi","dax"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3173,"user_id":4382919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvBse.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"greggyb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4382919/greggyb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569010032,"post_id":58034176,"comment_id":102471153,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034176/sum-of-time-duration-not-aggregating-past-24-hours-in-hhmmss-format-in-power#comment102471153_58034176"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11369342,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mxkA1_A6aA0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcrT8hH0U7dTfgCcZzmqH--oDWvoA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dalton Farriss","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11369342/dalton-farriss"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3173,"user_id":4382919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvBse.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"greggyb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4382919/greggyb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569244410,"post_id":58034176,"comment_id":102522847,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034176/sum-of-time-duration-not-aggregating-past-24-hours-in-hhmmss-format-in-power#comment102522847_58034176"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":106,"user_id":5621055,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FG865.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Angelo Canepa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5621055/angelo-canepa"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569356733,"creation_date":1569356733,"answer_id":58087637,"question_id":58034176,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58087637","body_markdown":"You need to divide the column seconds into the number of seconds in a day, in a new calculated column.\r\n\r\n    Hours = divide([Seconds],86400)\r\n\r\nAfter that, you need to change the data type of the column to Time for the same calculated column.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, you can create a Measure for summing up the hours\r\n\r\n    Hours_Sum = sum(Table[Hours])\r\n\r\nAnd change the data type of the measure to **hh:mm:ss**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nIn my case, I had **16,150** seconds representing **4:29:10**\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/v2dSN.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8Jk9u.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/VUjxC.png\r\n\r\nThe table I&#39;ve used was\r\n\r\n    +---------+\r\n    | Seconds |\r\n    +---------+\r\n    |     334 |\r\n    |      96 |\r\n    |    1607 |\r\n    |    1056 |\r\n    |    1355 |\r\n    |     551 |\r\n    |    1928 |\r\n    |     767 |\r\n    |     601 |\r\n    |    1214 |\r\n    |     607 |\r\n    |    1873 |\r\n    |     519 |\r\n    |     537 |\r\n    |     686 |\r\n    |     138 |\r\n    |     439 |\r\n    |    1842 |\r\n    +---------+","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034176/sum-of-time-duration-not-aggregating-past-24-hours-in-hhmmss-format-in-power/58087637#58087637","title":"Sum of Time Duration Not Aggregating past 24 Hours in &quot;hh:mm:ss&quot; format in Power Bi Visual Table"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11369342,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mxkA1_A6aA0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcrT8hH0U7dTfgCcZzmqH--oDWvoA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dalton Farriss","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11369342/dalton-farriss"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3173,"user_id":4382919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xvBse.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"greggyb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4382919/greggyb"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569356733,"creation_date":1569007737,"last_edit_date":1569009886,"question_id":58034176,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034176","body_markdown":"The data comes over as Duration within seconds as a data type Whole Number.

Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n    dftbl %&gt;% filter(b == 2) %&gt;% select(a) %&gt;% mean(na.rm = T) #NA\r\n\r\nThis fails in the same way, with the filtered &amp; selected data STILL being an N*1 tibble which refuses to play with `mean`.\r\n\r\n    dftbl %&gt;% filter(b == 2) %&gt;% select(a) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% .$a\r\n    # [1]  4  5 NA\r\n\r\nBut\r\n\r\n    dftbl %&gt;% filter(b == 2) %&gt;% select(a) %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% mean(.$a, na.rm = T)\r\n    # [1] NA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tibbles.html\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/587","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034173/subsetting-rows-and-columns-for-both-data-frame-and-tbl-df","title":"Subsetting rows and columns for both data.frame and tbl_df"},{"tags":["firefox","browser"],"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":1809078,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e85fefa73c2c65707b16bd48c8b43f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"biddlesby","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1809078/biddlesby"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569007710,"creation_date":1569007710,"question_id":58034172,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034172","body_markdown":"This is a question about browsers and privacy.\r\n\r\nI was browsing the web using Firefox 69.0.1 in Incognito mode.

would like to use the `ansible` module `os_keypair` to generate a ssh keypair with `openstack`. To do so I use the following code:\r\n\r\n    - name: create openstack ssh key pair\r\n      os_keypair:\r\n        name: my-key\r\n        auth: my authentication parameters\r\n        auth_type: password\r\n        state: present\r\n      register: key\r\n     \r\nWhen running that code starting from scratch i.e. no key previously generated, it works in the sense that the key is generated and uploaded in `openstack`.\r\nHowever, I would need the private key in order to perform subsequent actions through ansible (e.g. `local_action` for copying the private key to a file). The module documentation says that the private key is available as one of the return value. When checking my return values I get the following:\r\n\r\n    &quot;key&quot;: {\r\n       &quot;created_at&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;fingerprint&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;id&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;is_deleted&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;location&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;name&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;private_key&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;public_key&quot;: null, \r\n       &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ssh&quot;, \r\n       &quot;user_id&quot;: null\r\n    }\r\n\r\nwhich looks kind of puzzling to me. Is that normal behavior or is there something wrong with that module ?\r\n\r\n[UPDATE]\r\nHere is a complete playbook that reproduces that behavior:\r\n\r\n    ---\r\n    - hosts: localhost\r\n    \r\n      become_user: ansible\r\n    \r\n      become: True\r\n    \r\n      tasks:\r\n    \r\n        - name: create openstack ssh key pair\r\n          os_keypair:\r\n            name: my-key\r\n            auth:\r\n              auth_url: http://cloudsrv1.ill.fr:5000/v3\r\n              username: ansible-test\r\n              password: 1234\r\n              project_name: k8s\r\n              project_domain_name: default\r\n              user_domain_name: default\r\n            auth_type: password\r\n            state: present\r\n          register: key\r\n    \r\n        - debug:\r\n            var: key\r\n\r\nPlaybook executed with python3 as python interpreter.\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    TASK [debug] ********************************************************************************************************************\r\n    ok: [localhost] =&gt; {\r\n        &quot;key&quot;: {\r\n            &quot;changed&quot;: true, \r\n            &quot;failed&quot;: false, \r\n            &quot;id&quot;: &quot;my-key&quot;, \r\n            &quot;key&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;created_at&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;fingerprint&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;id&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;is_deleted&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;location&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;name&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;private_key&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;public_key&quot;: null, \r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;ssh&quot;, \r\n                &quot;user_id&quot;: null\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand however the key is generated as can be seen from the `openstack` snapshot.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/81zdS.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58034164/ansible-module-os-keypair-never-returns-the-value-of-private-key","title":"ansible module os_keypair never returns the value of private_key"},{"tags":["java","android"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12097029,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAZqzv2ZfGm2dCWsJVpIqJoahJJdIDekV--jShz1A=k-s128","display_name":"Gustav Leipoldt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12097029/gustav-leipoldt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8030,"user_id":4032703,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EJoshuaS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4032703/ejoshuas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569007711,"creation_date":1569007650,"last_edit_date":1569007711,"question_id":58034163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58034163","body_markdown":"Im populating a recycler View with a list of items.
