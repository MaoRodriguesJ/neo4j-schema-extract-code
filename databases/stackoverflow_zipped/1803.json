I have an Email Job which has an associated trigger which is scheduled to be run after two hours. The `jobGroup` and `jobName` are available to me. The `jobName`/`jobId` is &quot;28d5f25e-0669-4570-bdb2-b4e865fcdc02&quot; while the `jobGroup` is &quot;email-jobs&quot;. The trigger key also seems to be correct. \r\n\r\n```java\r\nString jobName = cancelEmailScheheduleRequest.get(&quot;jobName&quot;); //correct\r\nString jobGroup = cancelEmailScheheduleRequest.get(&quot;jobGroup&quot;); //correct jobGroup\r\nTriggerKey triggerKey = TriggerKey.triggerKey(jobName, jobGroup); // returns object {name: &quot;4dc25e67-10fa-4e2b-8ca0-c91c024a9a05&quot;, group: &quot;email-jobs&quot;}\r\nMap&lt;String, String&gt; response = new HashMap&lt;&gt;();\r\ntry {\r\n    if (scheduler.checkExists(triggerKey)) { //returns false instead of true\r\n        scheduler.unscheduleJob(triggerKey);\r\n        response.put(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Email Unscheduled&quot;);\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);\r\n    } else {\r\n        response.put(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;No such Email to  Unschedule&quot;);\r\n        return ResponseEntity.ok(response);\r\n    }\r\n} catch (SchedulerException e) {\r\n    e.printStackTrace();\r\n    response.put(&quot;message&quot;, &quot;Some Error occurred&quot;);\r\n    return ResponseEntity.ok(response);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut the line `scheduler.checkExists(triggerKey)` returns `FALSE` while it is supposed to return true and thus my trigger does not get unscheduled. Thus else condition is executed and the returned message is `No such Email to Unschedule`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112859/how-to-unschedule-a-trigger-for-a-job-in-quartz-scheduler-in-java","title":"How to unschedule a trigger for a job in quartz scheduler in Java?"},{"tags":["jquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":745,"user_id":1740487,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32a41562696697346e1d3a0644a398c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander Kludt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1740487/alexander-kludt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487498,"post_id":58112857,"comment_id":102615421,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112857/how-to-avoid-repetition-in-jquery#comment102615421_58112857"},{"owner":{"reputation":297,"user_id":8844603,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XDcr73-Q9jQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/jg_mJRrszFs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"med morad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8844603/med-morad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487967,"post_id":58112857,"comment_id":102615666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112857/how-to-avoid-repetition-in-jquery#comment102615666_58112857"},{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":12018983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bbe3edd051858d0aecf4d42d1e6bdc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FullStackMedia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018983/fullstackmedia"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569488190,"post_id":58112857,"comment_id":102615794,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112857/how-to-avoid-repetition-in-jquery#comment102615794_58112857"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":266712,"user_id":519413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7839089cd91dc5cc5eb1e0cdbf3312ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rory McCrossan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/519413/rory-mccrossan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569492052,"post_id":58113094,"comment_id":102617944,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112857/how-to-avoid-repetition-in-jquery/58113094#comment102617944_58113094"},{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":12018983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5bbe3edd051858d0aecf4d42d1e6bdc2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FullStackMedia","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018983/fullstackmedia"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569492874,"post_id":58113094,"comment_id":102618413,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112857/how-to-avoid-repetition-in-jquery/58113094#comment102618413_58113094"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":577875,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/be0ef1bbe70ddd2e8bf61f5c9a340778?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dennis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/577875/dennis"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569488212,"creation_date":1569488212,"answer_id":58113094,"question_id":58112857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58113094","body_markdown":"You should delegate your logic to a function.

attempting to render HTML as PDF using Razor ASP.NET pages and Select.pdf. \r\n\r\nAt first, everything seems fine, and the report generates correctly. But then I started adding images to the end of the report, and for some reason this caused the last page to render incorrectly, resulting in only half of the content being rendered. Not half the page, but half the content on the last page specifically. So if I have a single image on the last page, half the image renders. If I have two images side by side, it will render down to halfway through the tallest of the two images. If I add text after the images, it renders more until it is half of the height of the image + the text.\r\n\r\nHave anyone encountered this bug before? If so, how can I make the PDF generator work correctly?\r\n\r\nEDIT: The way I&#39;m adding the images is to add them via a for-loop, because I need to add them dynamically.

However now my Spring MVC Controller doesn&#39;t work. \r\n\r\nMy javascript : \r\n\r\n            var stompClient = null;\r\n\r\n            function setConnected(connected) {\r\n                document.getElementById(&#39;connect&#39;).disabled = connected;\r\n                document.getElementById(&#39;disconnect&#39;).disabled = !connected;\r\n                document.getElementById(&#39;conversationDiv&#39;).style.visibility\r\n                  = connected ? &#39;visible&#39; : &#39;hidden&#39;;\r\n                document.getElementById(&#39;response&#39;).innerHTML = &#39;&#39;;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            function connect() {\r\n                var socket = new SockJS(&#39;/spring-boot-web-jsp-1.0/chat&#39;);\r\n                stompClient = Stomp.over(socket);\r\n                stompClient.connect({}, function(frame) {\r\n                    setConnected(true);\r\n                    console.log(&#39;Connected: &#39; + frame);\r\n                    stompClient.subscribe(&#39;/spring-boot-web-jsp-1.0/topic/messages&#39;, function(messageOutput) {\r\n                        showMessageOutput(JSON.parse(messageOutput.body));\r\n                    });\r\n                });\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            function disconnect() {\r\n                if(stompClient != null) {\r\n                    stompClient.disconnect();\r\n                }\r\n                setConnected(false);\r\n                console.log(&quot;Disconnected&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            function sendMessage() {\r\n                var from = document.getElementById(&#39;from&#39;).value;\r\n                var text = document.getElementById(&#39;text&#39;).value;\r\n                stompClient.send(&quot;/spring-boot-web-jsp-1.0/app/chat&quot;, {},\r\n                  JSON.stringify({&#39;from&#39;:from, &#39;text&#39;:text}));\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            function showMessageOutput(messageOutput) {\r\n                var response = document.getElementById(&#39;response&#39;);\r\n                var p = document.createElement(&#39;p&#39;);\r\n                p.style.wordWrap = &#39;break-word&#39;;\r\n                p.appendChild(document.createTextNode(messageOutput.from + &quot;: &quot;\r\n                  + messageOutput.text + &quot; (&quot; + messageOutput.time + &quot;)&quot;));\r\n                response.appendChild(p);\r\n            }\r\n\r\nMy Controller : \r\n\r\n    @MessageMapping(&quot;/chat&quot;)\r\n    @SendTo(&quot;/topic/messages&quot;)\r\n    public OutputMessage send(Message message) throws Exception {\r\n        String time = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;HH:mm&quot;).format(new Date());\r\n        return new OutputMessage(message.getFrom(), message.getText(), time);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy message broker : \r\n\r\n    @Configuration\r\n    @EnableWebSocketMessageBroker\r\n    public class WebSocketConfig extends AbstractWebSocketMessageBrokerConfigurer {\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void configureMessageBroker(MessageBrokerRegistry config) {\r\n            config.enableSimpleBroker(&quot;/topic&quot;);\r\n            config.setApplicationDestinationPrefixes(&quot;/app&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void registerStompEndpoints(StompEndpointRegistry registry) {\r\n            registry.addEndpoint(&quot;/chat&quot;);\r\n            registry.addEndpoint(&quot;/chat&quot;).withSockJS();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried modifying the Controller to : \r\n\r\n    @MessageMapping(&quot;app/chat&quot;)\r\n    @SendTo(&quot;/topic/messages&quot;)\r\n    public OutputMessage send(Message message) throws Exception {\r\n        String time = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;HH:mm&quot;).format(new Date());\r\n        return new OutputMessage(message.getFrom(), message.getText(), time);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @MessageMapping(&quot;spring-boot-web-jsp-1.0/app/chat&quot;)\r\n    @SendTo(&quot;spring-boot-web-jsp-1.0/topic/messages&quot;)\r\n    public OutputMessage send(Message message) throws Exception {\r\n        String time = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;HH:mm&quot;).format(new Date());\r\n        return new OutputMessage(message.getFrom(), message.getText(), time);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand a bunch of other variations but none of them work. \r\nHow can I modify the Controller and javascript file to work when testing through external Apache Tomcat as well as embedded (setting a relative URL of some sort)?

trying to make a simple WPF application where you will be able to crop a video quickly and simply. I want it to look like and operate like how this website does it: https://clideo.com/crop-video \r\n\r\n![Video crop example][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt darkens the video outside of the boundaries and has the rule of thirds guidelines. It can also be freely resized to any aspect ratio. Having the &quot;grab&quot; squares on the corners and sides would be nice but i am not too fussed about that :)\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve had a search already and came across this: http://csharphelper.com/blog/2014/12/let-user-move-resize-rectangle-wpf-c/\r\n\r\nIt operates great but if you look at the code it doesn&#39;t work very nicely and will be messy to implement the dark background I think, it is also from 2014 and there is probably a better way to do this in WPF nowadays. The only way I can think of doing the dark background is to have 4 dark rectangles on the top, right, bottom and left, resizing when you resize the crop area. There is most likely a better way to do this, hence why I am here.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I&#39;m very new to WPF, not sure where to start, looking for some pointers :)\r\n\r\n[1]: https://puu.sh/Elw3s.jpg &quot;Video crop example&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112796/darkened-user-resizable-area-c-wpf-net-core","title":"Darkened User Resizable Area C# WPF .NET-Core"},{"tags":["php","loops","largenumber"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487397,"post_id":58112795,"comment_id":102615367,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112795/for-loop-index-gets-retyped-to-float-for-large-numbers#comment102615367_58112795"},{"owner":{"reputation":4659,"user_id":1173638,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq0Io.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1173638/adder"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487429,"post_id":58112795,"comment_id":102615385,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112795/for-loop-index-gets-retyped-to-float-for-large-numbers#comment102615385_58112795"},{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569487698,"post_id":58112795,"comment_id":102615522,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112795/for-loop-index-gets-retyped-to-float-for-large-numbers#comment102615522_58112795"},{"owner":{"reputation":125,"user_id":5095124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b02852c4583b2524d667931ffb07322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The Law","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5095124/the-law"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487871,"post_id":58112795,"comment_id":102615615,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112795/for-loop-index-gets-retyped-to-float-for-large-numbers#comment102615615_58112795"},{"owner":{"reputation":76447,"user_id":2310830,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6rM1.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RiggsFolly","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2310830/riggsfolly"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4659,"user_id":1173638,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Mq0Io.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1173638/adder"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569487952,"post_id":58112795,"comment_id":102615656,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112795/for-loop-index-gets-retyped-to-float-for-large-numbers#comment102615656_58112795"}],"owner":{"reputation":125,"user_id":5095124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b02852c4583b2524d667931ffb07322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The Law","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5095124/the-law"},"last_editor":{"reputation":125,"user_id":5095124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b02852c4583b2524d667931ffb07322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The Law","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5095124/the-law"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":0,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569487742,"creation_date":1569487159,"last_edit_date":1569487742,"question_id":58112795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58112795","body_markdown":"Consider this piece of code\r\n\r\n    $from = 486745904951485151;\r\n    $to = 486745904951485157;\r\n    $val = 486745904951485155;\r\n    for($i=$from; $i&lt;=$to;$i++) {\r\n       if($i == $val) {\r\n           return true;\r\n       }\r\n    }\r\nI need to do 8 iterations total, but because the `$i` does not equal `486745904951485151` but rather it is retyped to float so `$i=4.8674590495149E+17` what I end up is getting infinite(-ish) loop, because the iteration condition never gets there to end the loop, because the $to is still integer.\r\n\r\nI suppose this is some internal restriction of for iteration of php (docs were of no help), what is the best possible solution to handle the issue?

Each environment may have slightly different configuration of some features, e.g. remote web-service URLs. Additionaly, I would like - if possible - to have the following 2 properties met:\r\n\r\n 1. Per environment config should not in web-application repository\r\n \r\n This is because I feel it does not belong there. I would not want to manage n-configurations next to my source code. Moreover, if there are secrets there, I would not want every developer to see them...\r\n 2. Enforce completeness of configuration\r\n\r\n If I say that I need a certain configuration parameter/resource then it would be meaningless if it was not provided. I would not want my application to start in such case. \r\n\r\nPlease, can somebody more knowledgable and experienced help me and nudge me into the right direction?\r\n\r\n---\r\n## My findings so far ##\r\n\r\nNaturally, I have spent some time searching the answer already ...\r\n\r\n**Spring framework**\r\n\r\nI know that spring provides an [Environment](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html) class as an abstraction of environment-specific configuration. However, I am not using Spring framework, nor does it describe how to put this configuration outside of the web applicatoin.\r\n\r\n**Java EE JNDI Service**\r\n\r\nAccording to the [Java EE platform specification](https://download.oracle.com/otndocs/jcp/java_ee-8-final-eval-spec/index.html), the right way to do it would be to use `env-entry`, `resource-ref` and `resource-env-ref` elements in my `WEB-INF/web.xml` and have them bound/set to values in the web app container configuration.\r\n\r\nThis actually sounds very good, except that I don&#39;t know how to enforce the completeness of this configuration. I mean, I declare the above mentioned elements, to tell the deployer that I need them, yet I see (tested on tomcat) that application still deploys (and works incorrectly) when some, say resource-env-ref, is not bound.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know how to achieve it tbh, however, if there is nothing better, it still feels like the best thing I could find.

You just need to put the alias in the right file. Because Git doesn’t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially, you can easily set up an alias for each command using `git config` like so:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit config --global alias.co checkout\r\ngit config --global alias.br branch\r\ngit config --global alias.ci commit\r\ngit config --global alias.st status\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you use it the aliases like: `git ci`, `git co`, `git br`, `git st` in any repo.\r\n\r\nYou can also run an external command through an alias. In that case, you start the command with a `!` character. This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a Git repository:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\ngit config --global alias.visual &#39;!gitk&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might have also noticed that the `config` command takes in several parameters (like the `--global` one). If we look at the docs `man git config`:\r\n&gt; For writing options: write to global ~/.gitconfig file rather than the repository .git/config, write to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config file if this file exists and the ~/.gitconfig file doesn’t.\r\n&gt;         For reading options: read only from global ~/.gitconfig and from $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config rather than from all available files.\r\n&gt;           See also the section called “FILES”.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is also `--system`, which writes to `/etc/gitconfig`, `--local`, for the local repo `.git/gitconfig`, and `--worktree`, which is similar to `--local`.\r\n\r\nBut you can just directly edit the files themselves. It will look similar to this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# in ~/.gitconfig\r\n[alias]\r\n\tlg = log --all --stat --pretty=oneline --graph --format=&#39;%h %d %an %cr %s&#39; --oneline\r\n\tl = log --all --stat --graph --format=&#39;%h %d %an %cr %s&#39;\r\n\tup = pull --rebase\r\n\tbr = branch --verbose -a\r\n\tsfp = push --force-with-lease\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112788/creating-git-aliases/58114202#58114202","title":"Creating git aliases"}],"owner":{"reputation":442,"user_id":8826524,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/709c267b2ae4fc621fd988fe346d39af?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"may","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8826524/may"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569491727,"creation_date":1569487145,"question_id":58112788,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58112788","body_markdown":"I am trying to add the following aliases in ubuntu\r\n\r\n    alias l=log --pretty=format:&quot;%C(yellow)%h\\\\ %ad%Cred%d\\\\ %Creset%s%Cblue\\\\ [%cn]&quot; --decorate --date=short\r\n\r\n    $ source ~/.aliases\r\n    bash: alias: --decorate: not found\r\n    bash: alias: --decorate: not found\r\n    bash: alias: --numstat: not found\r\n\r\nI could use this command outside with git &lt;paste command&gt;\r\n\r\nI am not so sure why?

have a list of a list with numbers the outer list contains exactly one element (namely the inner list). The inner list is your list of integers over which you want to iterate. Hence to iterate over the inner list you would first have to access it from the outer list using indices for example like this:\r\n\r\n    for list_item in loss[0]:\r\n        do_something_for_each_element(list_item)\r\n\r\nMoreover, I think that you wanted to have separate elements in the inner list and not compute one single number, didn&#39;t you? If that is the case you have to separate each element using a `,`.\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n    loss=[[-137.70171527, -81408.95809899, -94508.84395371,   -311.81198933, -294.08711874]]\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nAs you clarified in the comments you want to iterate over a numpy matrix.

been messing around with the default interface implementations. Figured you have to de a downcast to the interface type to use a default method implementation. I also found a bunch of notes on another syntax, I can&#39;t find if this is already included or not, I did find &quot;decisions&quot; on how it&#39;s going to look, it doesn&#39;t work however. Am I doing it wrong or is this new syntax not included yet?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhat related but doesn&#39;t answer my question:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/57827493/calling-c-sharp-interface-default-method-from-implementing-struct-without-boxing\r\n\r\nNotes on the `base&lt;&gt;/base()` syntax: https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/blob/master/meetings/2018/LDM-2018-11-14.md#default-interface-implementations\r\n\r\n\r\nMicrosoft&#39;s page on the proposal: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/proposals/csharp-8.0/default-interface-methods\r\n\r\n\r\n    class D : IA, IB, IC\r\n    {\r\n                      //Notice the use of base() right here.\r\n        void IA.M() { base(IB).M(); }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nSo say we need INotifyPropertyChanged on some object. We can now have a SetField implementation as default on an interface:\r\n\r\n    public interface INotify : INotifyPropertyChanged\r\n    {\r\n        void InvokePropertyChanged(string propertyName);\r\n\r\n        bool SetField&lt;T&gt;(ref T field, T value, [CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)\r\n        {\r\n            INotify thing = (INotify)this;\r\n\r\n            if (propertyName == null)\r\n            {\r\n                throw new ArgumentException($&quot;{nameof(propertyName)} is null. PropertyChangedEventHandler will not be fired correctly.&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            if (EqualityComparer&lt;T&gt;.Default.Equals(field, value)) return false;\r\n            field = value;\r\n            InvokePropertyChanged(propertyName);\r\n            return true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementing it needs a downcast (`((INotify)this).SetField`), using `base(INotify)` would be preferred here.\r\n\r\n    public class Thing : INotify\r\n    {\r\n        public string A\r\n        {\r\n            get =&gt; _a;\r\n            //Need an explicit cast here.

I have a Angular 8 application. And I have a Parent and child relationship.\r\n\r\nSo I have a function in a parent DossierCorrespondenceComponent, but the function has to be triggererd in the child component. \r\n\r\nSo I have this function in the parent:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Input()  myGotoItem: Function;\r\n\r\n\r\ngotoItem(index, type: string) {\r\n    this.showingSingle = true;\r\n\r\n    switch (type) {\r\n      case &#39;correspondence&#39;: {\r\n        this.single = this.correspondenceEntries[index];\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n      case &#39;attachments&#39;: {\r\n        this.single = this.attachmentEntries[index];\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n      default: {\r\n        break;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    this.showingSingle = true;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I try to call it in the child component DossierCorrespondenceListComponent like this :\r\n\r\n\r\n```html\r\n &lt;tr class=&quot;dossier-correspondencerow&quot;

I found code on project imas to calculate the integrity of an app and have the problem that I can not set the sha256_placeholder so that the comparison at the end passes. With every run it seems that the calculated hash is different. Do you see how to fix this?\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot help you with validating your code I can alert you for the fact that this approach is easily bypassed by hooking an instrumentation framework, like Frida or xPosed, into the call to `doAppIntegrity()`, and then change its return value to be always a valid integrity check.\r\n\r\n[Frida](https://www.frida.re/)\r\n&gt; Inject your own scripts into black box processes. Hook any function, spy on crypto APIs or trace private application code, no source code needed. Edit, hit save, and instantly see the results. All without compilation steps or program restarts.\r\n\r\n[xPosed](https://repo.xposed.info/module/de.robv.android.xposed.installer)\r\n&gt; Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs. That&#39;s great because it means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without any changes (as long as the original code was not changed too much). It&#39;s also easy to undo.\r\n\r\nJust to have a notion of the power of instrumentation frameworks, you can watch [this video](https://youtu.be/yJRlMmJjrhY) to see how xPosed is being used to bypass certificate pinning during run-time.\r\n\r\nSo what I want to convey here is that any decisions you make in the client side can be bypassed by using the already mentioned instrumentation frameworks, but if you really want to know if your mobile app have been modified or not, you need to make that decision outside the device. In an high level overview you will need to have an external server that challenges the mobile app to determine its integrity, and not use the result of this integrity check directly on the mobile app, because you know, instrumentation frameworks can hook on the code that uses the integrity check result to decide if it can present or not some content, and modify it to always show the content. This means that the API server must be one that will use the integrity check result to decide to send or not the content to the mobile app. This concept have a name, Mobile App Attestation.\r\n\r\nBefore I dive into the Mobile APP Attestation concept I would like to first clear a misconception about **WHO** and **WHAT** is accessing an API server.\r\n\r\n# The Difference Between WHO and WHAT is Accessing the API Server\r\n\r\nTo better understand the differences between the **WHO** and the **WHAT** are accessing an API server, let’s use this picture:\r\n\r\n![Man in the Middle Attack](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4dgaJ.png)\r\n\r\nThe Intended Communication Channel represents the mobile app being used as you expected, by a legit user without any malicious intentions, using an untampered version of the mobile app, and communicating directly with the API server without being man in the middle attacked.\r\n\r\nThe actual channel may represent several different scenarios, like a legit user with malicious intentions that may be using a repackaged version of the mobile app, a hacker using the genuine version of the mobile app, while man in the middle attacking it, to understand how the communication between the mobile app and the API server is being done in order to be able to automate attacks against your API. Many other scenarios are possible, but we will not enumerate each one here.\r\n\r\nI hope that by now you may already have a clue why the **WHO** and the **WHAT** are not the same, but if not it will become clear in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe **WHO** is the user of the mobile app that we can authenticate, authorize and identify in several ways, like using OpenID Connect or OAUTH2 flows.\r\n\r\n&gt; [OAUTH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Generally, OAuth provides to clients a &quot;secure delegated access&quot; to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server.\r\n\r\n&gt; [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect/)\r\n\r\n&gt; OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.\r\n\r\nWhile user authentication may let the API server know **WHO** is using the API, it cannot guarantee that the requests have originated from **WHAT** you expect, the original version of the mobile app.\r\n\r\nNow we need a way to identify **WHAT** is calling the API server, and here things become more tricky than most developers may think. The **WHAT** is the thing making the request to the API server. Is it really a genuine instance of the mobile app, or is a bot, an automated script or an attacker manually poking around with the API server, using a tool like Postman?\r\n\r\nFor your surprise you may end up discovering that It can be one of the legit users using a repackaged version of the mobile app or an automated script that is trying to gamify and take advantage of the service provided by the application.\r\n\r\nWell, to identify the **WHAT**, developers tend to resort to an API key that usually they hard-code in the code of their mobile app. Some developers go the extra mile and compute the key at run-time in the mobile app, thus it becomes a runtime secret as opposed to the former approach when a static secret is embedded in the code.\r\n\r\n# Mobile App Attestation\r\n\r\nThe role of a Mobile App Attestation solution is to detect at run-time that your mobile app was not tampered with, is not running in a rooted device, not being instrumented by a framework like xPosed or Frida, not being MitM attacked, and this is achieved by running an SDK in the background. The service running in the cloud will challenge the app, and based on the responses it will attest the integrity of the mobile app and device is running on, thus the SDK will never be responsible for any decisions.\r\n\r\nOn successful attestation of the mobile app integrity a short time lived JWT token is issued and signed with a secret that only the API server and the Mobile App Attestation service in the cloud are aware. In the case of failure on the mobile app attestation the JWT token is signed with a secret that the API server does not know.\r\n\r\nNow the App must sent with every API call the JWT token in the headers of the request. This will allow the API server to only serve requests when it can verify the signature and expiration time in the JWT token and refuse them when it fails the verification.\r\n\r\nOnce the secret used by the Mobile App Attestation service is not known by the mobile app, is not possible to reverse engineer it at run-time even when the App is tampered, running in a rooted device or communicating over a connection that is being the target of a Man in the Middle Attack.\r\n\r\n# Summary\r\n\r\nWhile in app integrity checks can be used to male it hard for an attacker to mount an attack in the device, they are not harder to bypass, even for script kids or seasonal attackers.\r\n\r\nA best approach is to make the mobile app integrity checks decisions outside of the device, and at same time let the API server know them in order it can decide when to provide or not the content to the mobile app, because decisions made on the client side, aka the mobile app, can always be bypassed with instrumentation frameworks.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the solution to use in order to protect your mobile app and API server must be chosen in accordance with the value of what you are trying to protect and the legal requirements for that type of data, like the GDPR regulations in Europe.\r\n\r\n# Do you want to go the Extra Mile?\r\n\r\n[OWASP Mobile Security Project - Top 10 risks](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Mobile_Security_Project#Top_Ten_Mobile_Risks)\r\n\r\n&gt; The OWASP Mobile Security Project is a centralized resource intended to give developers and security teams the resources they need to build and maintain secure mobile applications. Through the project, our goal is to classify mobile security risks and provide developmental controls to reduce their impact or likelihood of exploitation.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58112724/how-to-calculate-app-integrity-with-code-from-imas-project/58166999#58166999","title":"How to calculate App integrity with code from iMas-Project?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3909,"user_id":997652,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d9a921cf39951fe04c31ad1c7e30a29?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"netshark1000","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997652/netshark1000"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569854688,"creation_date":1569486916,"question_id":58112724,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58112724","body_markdown":"I found code on project imas to calculate the integrity of an app and have the problem that I can not set the sha256_placeholder so that the comparison at the end passes.

Finalizers already run in dedicated thread and don&#39;t block anything, so there&#39;s no need. Therefore, `DisposeAsync` can always dispose both unmanaged and managed resources, and you don&#39;t need to implement a separate `DisposeAsync(bool disposing)` method. Usually it is fine to just implement a single `DisposeAsync` method, virtual or not depending on the nature of designed type.\r\n\r\nThe example of `IAsyncDisposable` implementation can be found in the sources of the new .NET Core type, [Utf8JsonWriter](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Text.Json/src/System/Text/Json/Writer/Utf8JsonWriter.cs#L364):\r\n\r\n    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        if (_stream == null)\r\n        {\r\n            // The conditions are ordered with stream first as that would be the most common mode\r\n            if (_output == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        await FlushAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\r\n        ResetHelper();\r\n\r\n        _stream = null;\r\n        _arrayBufferWriter = null;\r\n        _output = null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBasically, it should do the same things as `Dispose(true)` in regular Disposable pattern, but asynchronously, if possible. If it&#39;s not possible to do disposal asynchronously, but you still need to implement this interface for some reason, you can fall back to synchronous disposal and return completed ValueTask after that, as done in [System.IO.Stream](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/Common/src/CoreLib/System/IO/Stream.cs#L218).

I&#39;m quoting apple documentation - https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Security/Conceptual/AppSandboxDesignGuide/AppSandboxInDepth/AppSandboxInDepth.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40011183-CH3-SW22\r\n\r\n**Scenario 1:**\r\nYour app needs to be able to save a file with a different extension than that of the original file. For example, when you paste an image into an RTF file in TextEdit and save it, TextEdit changes the file’s extension from .rtf to .rtfd (and it becomes a directory).\r\n\r\nTo handle this situation, you must use an **NSFileCoordinator** object to coordinate access to the file. Before you rename the file, call the **itemAtURL:willMoveToURL: method**. After you rename the file, call the **itemAtURL:didMoveToURL: method**.\r\n\r\n**Scenario 2:**\r\nYour app needs to be able to open or save multiple related files with the same name and different extensions (for example, to automatically open a subtitle file with the same name as a movie file, or to allow for a SQLite journal file).\r\n\r\nTo gain access to that secondary file, create a class that conforms to the NSFilePresenter protocol.

have a list of objects (&quot;Albums&quot; in my case) fetched from the database. I need to edit these objects. \r\nIn the editing component in the useEffect hook I fire up the action for getting the needed album using it&#39;s ID. This action works. However in the same useEffect I am trying to fetch the changed by before fired action redux state. And now I face the problem - all I am fetching is the previos state. \r\nHow can I implement in the useEffect fetching of current redux state?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen similar questions here, however none of the answers were helpfull for my use case.\r\n\r\nI am using redux-thunk.\r\n\r\nEditing component. The problem appears in setFormData - it&#39;s fetching previous state from the reducer, not the current one.
