In what exact situation does this 3rd warning come?\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/z/f5qxK3\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/58274145/11279879","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245033/warning-function-f-is-not-needed-and-will-not-be-emitted","title":"Warning: function &#39;F&#39; is not needed and will not be emitted"},{"tags":["mysql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":506,"user_id":12024030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/S7QgC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FrustratedDeveloper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12024030/frustrateddeveloper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570249194,"post_id":58245030,"comment_id":102862468,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245030/select-values-that-are-higher-or-lower-than-0-00#comment102862468_58245030"},{"owner":{"reputation":57829,"user_id":9473764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1a6d80ec4ac5549a392ae88fb0ed688?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9473764/nick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570252899,"post_id":58245030,"comment_id":102862876,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245030/select-values-that-are-higher-or-lower-than-0-00#comment102862876_58245030"},{"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5949213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1dd2081142297c12d8158f0f5c512b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5949213/john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570264785,"post_id":58245030,"comment_id":102864665,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245030/select-values-that-are-higher-or-lower-than-0-00#comment102864665_58245030"},{"owner":{"reputation":10635,"user_id":366348,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5aad936ba0bd33d9a5141a6be4ca1a89?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Naktibalda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/366348/naktibalda"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570451286,"post_id":58245030,"comment_id":102906119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245030/select-values-that-are-higher-or-lower-than-0-00#comment102906119_58245030"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5949213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1dd2081142297c12d8158f0f5c512b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5949213/john"},"last_editor":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5949213,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1dd2081142297c12d8158f0f5c512b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5949213/john"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570252601,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570265849,"creation_date":1570244984,"last_edit_date":1570265849,"question_id":58245030,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58245030","body_markdown":"I am trying to calculate and show the results when the value is not equal to 0.00.

Here&#39;s an example:\r\n```\r\nmy_list = [&quot;I&quot;, &quot;like&quot;, &quot;code&quot;]\r\n&#39;&#39;.join(my_list)\r\n&gt; &#39;Ilikecode&#39;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245027/why-does-part-of-my-if-statement-show-but-the-other-part-does-not/58245097#58245097","title":"Why does part of my if statement show, but the other part does not?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12167197,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba77d4a0ec1186b3244c85b89e88ed2e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"someonerandom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167197/someonerandom"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570256890,"creation_date":1570244901,"last_edit_date":1570256890,"question_id":58245027,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58245027","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been stuck on this program for a while now.

I am trying to get the GDP by fiscal quarter, where each quarter is the mean of the corresponding month&#39;s GDP.\r\n\r\nHere is a snippet of the dataframe (disregard the values as they are just for the example).\r\n\r\n    State    City        2000-01   2000-02   2000-03   2000-04   2000-05   2000-06 \r\n    Alabama  Adamsville  1000      1005      1020      1119      1125      1000\r\n    Alabama  Alabaster   1093      1312      1542      1624      1134      1953\r\n    Alabama  Axis        18324     98174     14047     27343     43234     12434\r\n\r\n\r\nMy expected output is as follows (again, the values are made up). As an example, 2000q1 is the mean of the columns 2000-01, 2000-02, and 2000-03. \r\n\r\n    State    City        2000q1   2000q2 \r\n    Alabama  Adamsville  1010     1006\r\n    Alabama  Alabaster   1100     1750\r\n    Alabama  Axis        15673    19849\r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried several different ways, most notably:\r\n\r\nBecause the output dataframe will have 64 different quarters, it is inefficient to do the following for each quarter:\r\n\r\n    df[&#39;2000q1&#39;]=df[[&#39;2000-01&#39;, &#39;2000-02&#39;, &#39;2000-03&#39;]].mean(axis=1)\r\n\r\nIn another attempt I changed all the column names to represent the quarter they should be apart of, resulting in three identical column names (but not underlying data) for each quarter, as seen below. Because the column names were identical, I then struggled in finding the mean for each trio of identical column names.\r\n\r\n    State    City        2000q1    2000q1    2000q1    2000q2    2000q2    2000q2 \r\n    Alabama  Adamsville  1000      1005      1020      1119      1125      1000\r\n    Alabama  Alabaster   1093      1312      1542      1624      1134      1953\r\n    Alabama  Axis        18324     98174     14047     27343     43234     12434\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245005/how-to-create-a-new-column-from-a-subset-of-other-existing-columns","title":"How to create a new column from a subset of other existing columns?"},{"tags":["python"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11620448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1d8eb4c38b4bea5882773c277e3e548?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FMA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11620448/fma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570246901,"post_id":58245026,"comment_id":102862229,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245004/how-do-i-split-strings-from-a-list-and-store-them-to-another-list/58245026#comment102862229_58245026"},{"owner":{"reputation":251,"user_id":12135968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhjSN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pauliner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135968/pauliner"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11620448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1d8eb4c38b4bea5882773c277e3e548?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FMA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11620448/fma"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570299115,"post_id":58245026,"comment_id":102872458,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245004/how-do-i-split-strings-from-a-list-and-store-them-to-another-list/58245026#comment102872458_58245026"},{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":11620448,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a1d8eb4c38b4bea5882773c277e3e548?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FMA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11620448/fma"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570365966,"post_id":58245026,"comment_id":102883537,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58245004/how-do-i-split-strings-from-a-list-and-store-them-to-another-list/58245026#comment102883537_58245026"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":251,"user_id":12135968,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lhjSN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"pauliner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12135968/pauliner"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570244871,"creation_date":1570244871,"answer_id":58245026,"question_id":58245004,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58245026","body_markdown":"Every time `word=x.split(&#39; &#39;)` runs, the previous value of `words` is replaced by a new value.

But... *you call this dazzling skyscraper of code &quot;a lot quicker and easier&quot; than vanilla SQL for real?* \r\n\r\nFor some reason you are constantly moving your code back and forth from one format into another. For example, you are creating an array `array(&quot;*&quot;)` then convert it into object `(object)` and then... convert it back into array `(array) $a_verify-&gt;selection`. Why?\r\n\r\nOr you take a simple SQL query, `SELECT * FROM users WHERE code = ?` and create a multiple-line construction where SQL keywords are substituted with array keys with an addition of a lot of quotes, parentheses and stuff. *And then convert it back into SQL*. \r\n\r\nSQL is an amazing language, it survived for decades thanks to its simplicity and strictness. There is no reason to dismantle it into pieces to add a structure. SQL already has a structure. *And it has many features that just aren&#39;t supported by your helper*. In the end, with so much effort you get a severely limited SQL version with complicated syntax and entangled implementation. You call it a helper function? \r\n\r\nLast but not least. Such functions where you are adding column and table names freely are **asking for SQL injection**. And your [other question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53974972/stdclass-object-has-strange-quirk-on-live-site-but-not-local-machine) displays this appalling practice - you are adding the user input directly in your SQL. Why bother with prepared statements if you have an injection anyway? See [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7537500/285587) on how to deal with such situations.\r\n\r\nLet me show you a real helper function. It makes your code short and readable and it supports full features of SQL (ordering the results for example):\r\n\r\n    function prepared_query($mysqli, $sql, $params, $types = &quot;&quot;)\r\n    {\r\n        $types = $types ?: str_repeat(&quot;s&quot;, count($params));\r\n        $stmt = $mysqli-&gt;prepare($sql);\r\n        $stmt-&gt;bind_param($types, ...$params);\r\n        $stmt-&gt;execute();\r\n        return $stmt;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re interesting in how it works you can read the explanation I wrote [here](https://phpdelusions.net/mysqli/simple).\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s rewrite your helper function based on mine\r\n\r\n    function verifyRow($mysqli, $sql, $parameters) {\r\n        $result = prepared_query($mysqli, $sql, $parameters)-&gt;get_result();\r\n        return (bool)$result-&gt;fetch_assoc();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJust two lines of code!\r\n\r\nAnd now to verify the actual row:\r\n\r\n    var_dump(verifyRow($mysqli, &quot;SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE code = ?&quot;, [&#39;12345&#39;]));\r\n\r\n*One line instead of a dozen.*\r\n\r\nNow to the question why it doesn&#39;t find anything. There are two possible reasons. \r\n\r\n- indeed there is some misconfiguration.\r\n- a much simpler case: there is no such data in the table you are querying at the moment\r\n\r\nTo test for the former you must enable PHP error reporting. If your code doesn&#39;t work as expected then there must be an error somewhere and all you need is to catch it. Add these two lines to your code\r\n\r\n    error_reporting(E_ALL);\r\n    mysqli_report(MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT);\r\n    ini_set(&#39;log_errors&#39;,1); // well to be 100% sure it will be logged\r\n\r\nin order to make sure that all PHP and mysql errors will present themselves. Then run the code again. If it won&#39;t produce any error then likely your system is configured properly. \r\n\r\nNow to test your data. Write a different query that would return all rows from the table\r\n\r\n    $sql = &quot;SELECT code FROM users WHERE 1 = ?&quot;;\r\n    $result = prepared_query($mysqli, $sql, [1])-&gt;get_result();\r\n    var_dump($result-&gt;fetch_all(MYSQLI_ASSOC));\r\n\r\nand see what you really have in your database. Probably there are no rows or a different code value. A hint: there could be non-printable characters that would prevent the matching. to reveal them use a very handy function `rawurlencode()`: it will leave all basic characters as is but convert everything else into hex codes making them an easy spot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244993/mysqli-prepared-statement-returns-0-rows-no-errors/58245820#58245820","title":"mysqli prepared statement returns 0 rows, no errors"}],"owner":{"reputation":308,"user_id":4001839,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/28ddcb5efedc6687fa1a68415a660257?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tomc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001839/tomc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58245820,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570257665,"creation_date":1570244272,"question_id":58244993,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244993","body_markdown":"I created a series of helper functions in php that I have been using because they make prepared mysqli statements a lot quicker and easier to follow for me.

However, *inside the parentheses*, you do not specify a table alias for [PTPARTY].  Thus, `a.UNIQUID` is invalid.\r\n\r\nSince there is only 1 table, the alias or table reference is unnecessary.  For clarity, I will add the **optional** &quot;AS&quot; from here on.  With only 1 table, you can do this with only the column names:\r\n\r\n    FROM\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             UNIQID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME \r\n         FROM [PTPARTY]) AS a\r\n\r\nOf course, you would often have joined tables and want to use aliases, so you can do that inside the parentheses:\r\n\r\n    FROM\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             z.UNIQID, z.FIRSTNAME, z.LASTNAME \r\n         FROM [PTPARTY] AS z) AS a\r\n\r\nIn this scenario, the table alias &quot;z&quot; is not available/valid outside of the parentheses.  For that reason, even though it is probably not best practice, you can even re-use the same alias.  Again, though, **this can become confusing**.\r\n\r\n    FROM\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             a.UNIQID, a.FIRSTNAME, a.LASTNAME \r\n         FROM [PTPARTY] AS a) AS a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244980/how-to-correctly-word-an-inner-join/58249535#58249535","title":"How to correctly word an inner join"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":2844963,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6b504d2688c99175c40f3a3a6f31139a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pthanner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2844963/pthanner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":608491,"user_id":13302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":99,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b4779212f57ff2e9549ea90a4499c2d7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"marc_s","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/13302/marc-s"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58249535,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570287891,"creation_date":1570244007,"last_edit_date":1570257104,"question_id":58244980,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244980","body_markdown":"I am trying to learn joins and have read extensively here (SOFlow) and several other places and of course copied code and tried it out.\r\n\r\nSo I made this code to suit my table:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n        a.FIRSTNAME, a.LASTNAME, \r\n        b.[LINE1], b.[LINE2], b.[LINE3], b.[SUBURB], \r\n        b.[STATE], b.[POSTCODE], \r\n        p.[PRIVATE], p.[BUSINESS], p.[MOBILE]\r\n    FROM\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             a.UNIQID, a.FIRSTNAME, a.LASTNAME \r\n         FROM [PTPARTY]) a\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             [LINE1], [LINE2], [LINE3], [SUBURB], [STATE], [POSTCODE], PARTYID \r\n         FROM \r\n             [PTAddresses]\r\n         WHERE \r\n             ADDRESS_TYPE = &#39;Mailing&#39;) b ON a.Uniqid = b.Partyid\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             [Uniqid], [PRIVATE], [BUSINESS], [MOBILE]\r\n         FROM [PTPhone]) P ON a.Uniqid = P.Uniqid\r\n    WHERE\r\n        a.UNIQID = 4\r\n\r\nBut I get:\r\n\r\n&gt; Msg 4104, Level 16, State 1, Line 3  \r\n&gt; The multi-part identifier &quot;a.UNIQID&quot; could not be bound.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Msg 4104, Level 16, State 1, Line 3  \r\n&gt; The multi-part identifier &quot;a.FIRSTNAME&quot; could not be bound.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; Msg 4104, Level 16, State 1, Line 3  \r\n&gt; The multi-part identifier &quot;a.LASTNAME&quot; could not be bound.\r\n\r\nWhere as this code perform perfectly\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n        a.FIRSTNAME, a.LASTNAME, \r\n        b.[LINE1], b.[LINE2], b.[LINE3], b.[SUBURB], b.[STATE], b.[POSTCODE],\r\n        p.[PRIVATE], p.[BUSINESS], p.[MOBILE]\r\n    FROM\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             PTPARTY.UNIQID, PTPARTY.FIRSTNAME, PTPARTY.LASTNAME \r\n         FROM [PTPARTY]) a\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             [LINE1], [LINE2], [LINE3], [SUBURB], [STATE], [POSTCODE], PARTYID \r\n         FROM \r\n             [PTAddresses]\r\n         WHERE\r\n             ADDRESS_TYPE = &#39;Mailing&#39;) b ON a.Uniqid = b.Partyid\r\n    INNER JOIN\r\n        (SELECT \r\n             [Uniqid], [PRIVATE], [BUSINESS], [MOBILE]\r\n         FROM [PTPhone]) P ON a.Uniqid = P.Uniqid\r\n    WHERE\r\n        a.UNIQID = 4\r\n\r\nI am 99% sure the not Working code was copied from here with changes to fit my tables of course.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if I am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nWell I am sure I am doing something wrong, but would like to know what.\r\n\r\nKind regards to you all and keep up the good work\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244980/how-to-correctly-word-an-inner-join","title":"How to correctly word an inner join"},{"tags":["unity3d","arcore","agora.io"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12167180,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BpFVXIrbxhc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re4lMmwP8-t99vhyafEaVRRYJ7cmQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Naveen Sachdeva","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167180/naveen-sachdeva"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23205,"user_id":1033581,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e8891617e36b8d1254eb3ce1a5662da4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Cœur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1033581/c%c5%93ur"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":29,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571826176,"creation_date":1570243902,"last_edit_date":1571826176,"question_id":58244975,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244975","body_markdown":"I am trying to capture ARCORE Camera Video and send it to agora broadcasting feature.

You could simply dump support for IE and then proceed with `mask-image` since it even works in MS Edge. Only your own usage stats can tell you if this is a good idea.\r\n\r\n##Option 2\r\n\r\nDump the second image and use a gradient overlay of the main image to a flat color background. Which you probably don&#39;t want to do, but it&#39;s a decent progressive enhancement option.\r\n\r\n##Option 3\r\nIts a lot of work but you could use `Canvas` and Javascript to fake it. The basic idea is to slice the main image into individual canvas elements. One element for each pixel wide the image is and then draw the source image into the canvas elements with the correct offset. The slices then stack side by side in the canvas re-making the full image. At this point, you can change the opacity of each slice until you get a gradient fade effect.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the image fades out to the right side, the furthest right slice is 0% opaque, the next to the left is 1%, then next is 2%, etc\r\n\r\nThis is untested, but something along these lines except this fades evenly from left opaque to right trasnparent:\r\n\r\n    var theCanvas = document.getElementById(&#39;canvasContainer&#39;);\r\n    fadeImage = theCanvas.getContext(&#39;2d&#39;);\r\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; sourceImage.width; i++) {\r\n    \tfadeImage.globalAlpha = (sourceImage.width - i) / sourceImage.width;\r\n        fadeImage.drawImage(sourceImage, i, 0, 1, sourceImage.height, i, 0, 1, sourceImage.height);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244946/is-there-any-way-to-blend-a-non-hard-coded-background-into-another-non-hard-code/58245670#58245670","title":"Is there any way to blend a non-hard-coded background into another non-hard-coded background using pure CSS or otherwise?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570266865,"creation_date":1570266865,"answer_id":58246919,"question_id":58244946,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58246919","body_markdown":"As said by @Bryce Howitson you can use `mask`\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .box {\r\n      width:300px;\r\n      height:200px;\r\n      position:relative;\r\n    }\r\n    .box:before,\r\n    .box:after{\r\n       content:&quot;&quot;;\r\n       position:absolute;\r\n       top:0;\r\n       left:0;\r\n       right:0;\r\n       bottom:0;\r\n       background-image:url(https://picsum.photos/id/2/800/800);\r\n       background-size:cover;\r\n       background-position:center;\r\n    }\r\n    .box:after {\r\n       background-image:url(https://picsum.photos/id/13/800/800);\r\n       -webkit-mask:linear-gradient(to right,#fff 35%,transparent 70%);\r\n       mask:linear-gradient(to right,#fff 35%,transparent 70%);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244946/is-there-any-way-to-blend-a-non-hard-coded-background-into-another-non-hard-code/58246919#58246919","title":"Is there any way to blend a non-hard-coded background into another non-hard-coded background using pure CSS or otherwise?"}],"owner":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4014834,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daveh0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014834/daveh0"},"last_editor":{"reputation":324,"user_id":4014834,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Daveh0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4014834/daveh0"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570266865,"creation_date":1570243517,"last_edit_date":1570250541,"question_id":58244946,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244946","body_markdown":"I&#39;m pretty positive this can&#39;t be done, but I figured I&#39;d check before moving on to Plan B.

The same Pen also shows a version using  `-webkit-mask-image` rather than the pseudo element, which gets it closer, but is lacking IE support.\r\n\r\nWithout extensive SVG coding (it&#39;s not worth the time -- for this use case -- to keep the variable background pattern/image), is there a way (preferably PURE CSS) to achieve this masking effect without having to edit either image?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/k4gAD.png\r\n  [2]: https://codepen.io/daveh0/pen/vYYYLbM","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244946/is-there-any-way-to-blend-a-non-hard-coded-background-into-another-non-hard-code","title":"Is there any way to blend a non-hard-coded background into another non-hard-coded background using pure CSS or otherwise?"},{"tags":["bash"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3951,"user_id":4518341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eVuAv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wjandrea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4518341/wjandrea"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570247181,"post_id":58244943,"comment_id":102862253,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244943/dynamic-bash-associative-array-keys#comment102862253_58244943"},{"owner":{"reputation":178,"user_id":3161835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb21bb688f23f8087aea372d0d3333c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bkvaluemeal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3161835/bkvaluemeal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3951,"user_id":4518341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eVuAv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wjandrea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4518341/wjandrea"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570247605,"post_id":58244943,"comment_id":102862291,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244943/dynamic-bash-associative-array-keys#comment102862291_58244943"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":178,"user_id":3161835,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb21bb688f23f8087aea372d0d3333c8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bkvaluemeal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3161835/bkvaluemeal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570247326,"post_id":58245162,"comment_id":102862266,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244943/dynamic-bash-associative-array-keys/58245162#comment102862266_58245162"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":164,"user_id":12018836,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBK42IpvVDOWDK2KCfYQXb0sp726VgTGqBCmtxT=k-s128","display_name":"Avinash Yadav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12018836/avinash-yadav"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3951,"user_id":4518341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eVuAv.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"wjandrea","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4518341/wjandrea"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570247064,"last_edit_date":1570247064,"creation_date":1570246879,"answer_id":58245162,"question_id":58244943,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58245162","body_markdown":"**This Will Work**\r\n\r\n    NAME=foo\r\n    temp=&quot;${NAME^^}_ARRAY[@]&quot;\r\n    echo ${!temp}\r\n\r\n**Explanation:** here temp will store &quot;

It is part of ansi-sql, so it does not depend on your brand of db. Watch out, sql uses 1-based indexing, java is 0-based, java uses the end-index, sql the length of the substring.\r\n\r\nString concatenation (the &quot;+&quot;) is done in sql using CONCAT (also in the Ansi standard) giving us, let&#39;s see...\r\n\r\n    SELECT CONCAT(SUBSTRING(Fieldname, 1, 6), &quot;XXX&quot;, SUBSTRING(Fieldname, 10, 2)) AS PATCHED FROM\r\n    Tablename;\r\n\r\nThen the java regex version:\r\n\r\n    &quot;62591000756&quot;.replaceAll(&quot;([0-9]{6})([0-9]{3})([0-9]{2})&quot;, &quot;$1XXX$2&quot;)\r\n\r\nAs for the sql version, depends on your database. Some do regex replace, [oracle does][1].\r\n\r\nIf you want to generify this to allow for masks of any length at any index, with the regex approach it is at hand: just set custom values for the numbers in the regex ({6}{3}{2}) something like `String.format(&quot;([0-9]{%d})([0-9]{%d})([0-9]{%d})&quot;, lenghtPrefix, lengthMask, lengthPostfix)`. Note that you&#39;ll introduce a lot of corner cases doing so, e.g. index and legth of the mask must be in the range of the original string.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m positive you can write a single sql that can handle this, but it might become complex, or, since you&#39;re using Oracle, you could write a plsql function for the job which then can be used in sql. Oracle also allows to embed java, never tried this, though.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14200/functions130.htm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244925/data-masking-with-specific-format/58245360#58245360","title":"Data masking with specific format"}],"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":7363002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b56ae31ed8c1776eba3f3aacc7e8da3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Viper629","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7363002/viper629"},"last_editor":{"reputation":60,"user_id":7363002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b56ae31ed8c1776eba3f3aacc7e8da3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Viper629","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7363002/viper629"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570271679,"creation_date":1570243168,"last_edit_date":1570263565,"question_id":58244925,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244925","body_markdown":"Given a string \r\n\r\n&gt;&quot;62591000756&quot;\r\n\r\n how can I perform masking on the string such that the first 6 character and last 2 character is shown in plain text and the rest is replaced with &quot;X&quot; ?

Using DSM is easier then DOM\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://mfatihercik.github.io/dsm/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244900/how-can-i-dynamically-unmarshal-xml-in-java/58255770#58255770","title":"How can i dynamically unmarshal xml in java?"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9719998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N4k46qXcgq4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAaE/PNNdvjnWDu8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rajshree Rai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9719998/rajshree-rai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":9719998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-N4k46qXcgq4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAaE/PNNdvjnWDu8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rajshree Rai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9719998/rajshree-rai"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58246240,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570352720,"creation_date":1570242743,"last_edit_date":1570255488,"question_id":58244900,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244900","body_markdown":"I have a very large xml to unmarshal.

use a set until you have good reason not to.*\r\n\r\nI would consider a set to be more idiomatic. It conveys the meaning more clearly, since order doesn&#39;t matter, only membership. When in doubt, use a set. \r\n\r\nAnd to be clear, a set is a *collection* but not a &quot;sequence type&quot; (even though it&#39;s iterable), because it&#39;s semantically &quot;unordered&quot;.\r\n***\r\nWhy not use a set?\r\n\r\nSets may only contain hashable types. If you need to check membership of a collection of unhashable types, you&#39;re out of luck. Sometimes you can use hashable elements instead (like `frozenset` or `tuple`), sometimes you can&#39;t. \r\n\r\nBut tuples and lists don&#39;t have that limitation. \r\n***\r\nWhy a list over a tuple?\r\n\r\nThe main advantage of a list is just a syntactic quirk for one element. Say you have `(&#39;foo&#39;, &#39;bar&#39;)` and later decide to remove the `&#39;bar&#39;`. Then you have `(&#39;foo&#39;)`. Oops, see what I did there? It was actually supposed to be `(&#39;foo&#39;,)`. It&#39;s easy to forget the comma. And the `in` check still works for strings like `(&#39;foo&#39;)`, since `in` checks for substrings. This can subtly change the meaning of your program. `&#39;oo&#39;` is in `(&#39;foo&#39;)`, but not in `(&#39;foo&#39;,)`.\r\n\r\nA one-item list like `[&#39;foo&#39;]` doesn&#39;t have that problem. [And as \r\nuser2357112 pointed out, a constant list is going to get compiled to a tuple anyway.]\r\n\r\nNote that a one-item set, like `{&#39;a&#39;}` doesn&#39;t have that problem either. An empty `{}` is a dict instead, but that&#39;s not going to cause any issues with an `in` check because it&#39;s also an empty collection.\r\n\r\nBut you should arguably be using `==` instead of `in` when comparing against only one element.\r\n***\r\nThat&#39;s it for clarity. Now for the micro-optimizations. Early optimization is the root of all evil. Don&#39;t optimize at the expense of readability before it&#39;s actually necessary.\r\n\r\nA set lookup is faster if it&#39;s not too small, since a tuple&#39;s elements have to be checked one-by-one which (on average) grows with the size of the tuple, while a set is backed by a hashtable (like a dict), which has a small constant overhead. If the distribution of cases isn&#39;t uniform, this means that the order of elements in the tuple matters a lot. Putting the more common cases first in the tuple will make the checks much faster than the reverse, on average.\r\n\r\nHow small does the collection have to be to for the set&#39;s constant overhead to matter? Profile and see. Performance can vary based on a lot of factors. It&#39;s not just the number of elements, but how long an equality check takes, and where they&#39;re located in memory, etc.\r\n\r\nA tuple should have a slightly smaller overhead both in memory and construction time than the other collections. But the construction overhead doesn&#39;t really matter if the compiler can make it load as a saved constant value. (This can happen when all the elements are themselves constant at compile time. You can use the `dis` module to confirm this is happening.)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244894/which-sequence-type-is-better-for-a-comparison-and-why-python/58244906#58244906","title":"Which sequence type is better for a comparison and why?

How can I accomplish this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244867/how-can-i-change-h1-through-h6-to-have-same-padding-as-p-using-em-instead","title":"How can I change &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; to have same padding as &lt;p&gt; using em instead of px while keeping them all the same?"},{"tags":["php","ffmpeg"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570250219,"post_id":58244865,"comment_id":102862584,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244865/ffmpeg-drawtext-performance#comment102862584_58244865"},{"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":6317583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6FDLS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roldan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6317583/roldan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570302557,"post_id":58244865,"comment_id":102873317,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244865/ffmpeg-drawtext-performance#comment102873317_58244865"},{"owner":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570336296,"post_id":58244865,"comment_id":102878208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58244865/ffmpeg-drawtext-performance#comment102878208_58244865"}],"owner":{"reputation":67,"user_id":6317583,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6FDLS.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Roldan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6317583/roldan"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570242166,"creation_date":1570242166,"question_id":58244865,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58244865","body_markdown":"Im running the following command within PHP using shell_exec:\r\n\r\n\r\n    ffmpeg -i $sourcePath -vf \\&quot;drawtext=text=&#39;$txt&#39;:fontfile=&#39;$fontPath&#39;:fontcolor=&#39;red&#39;:fontsize=&#39;40&#39;:x=w-mod(max(t-1\\,0)*(w+tw)/30\\,(w+tw)):y=main_h/2\\&quot; -acodec copy $targetPath\r\n\r\n\r\nIt works fine but it takes for ever.
