The user can then input text into some of the fields of this pdf. Once the user has completed inputting his or her information, I&#39;d like for them to click on a button outside of the pdf (written in Razor or something) that will take the pdf with the user input and send it back up to the server. How can I accomplish this?\r\n\r\nCurrently, my controller looks as follows:\r\n\r\n*HomeController.cs*\r\n\r\n    public ActionResult About()\r\n    {\r\n        return View();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ActionResult Test()\r\n    {\r\n        FileStream fs = System.IO.File.OpenRead(Server.MapPath(&quot;~/Forms/SignatureTest.pdf&quot;));\r\n        byte[] byteFile = new byte[fs.Length];\r\n        fs.Read(byteFile, 0, byteFile.Length);\r\n        fs.Close();\r\n\r\n        FileContentResult result = new FileContentResult(byteFile, &quot;application/pdf&quot;);\r\n        return result;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand my View...\r\n\r\n*About.cshtml*\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;iframe src=&quot;@Url.Action(&quot;Test&quot;,&quot;Home&quot;)&quot; class=&quot;embed-responsive-item&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note: I do **not** want to have a submit button within the actual pdf itself, such as these resources suggest:\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/12942226/retrieve-pdf-from-iframe\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/24916122/reading-a-pdf-back-from-an-iframe\r\n\r\n\r\nI was wondering if maybe I could give iframe an id and then use jquery or something to pull the document from that element using the ID and postback to the server. Or maybe I can make use of models and somehow save the model.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t necessarily need to use iframe either; I can also use object or embed.\r\n\r\nAre there any suggestions on how I can

a total beginner with Python, so please bear with me!\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to create an automation that opens documents relevant to a subject at the time that the user&#39;s class for that subject begins. All of it is based on the user&#39;s input and runs in the background. \r\n\r\nMy question is: How can I get the code to open different files for each set of inputs?\r\n\r\nSo far I&#39;ve managed to code the opening of the document at a specified time. It was easy when I put the file path and time in the code myself, but now I have problems when trying to use the user input.\r\n\r\nThis is my code so far:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport schedule\r\nimport subprocess\r\nimport time\r\n\r\n# Initial user input\r\n\r\nsubjects = list(map(str, input(&quot;&quot;&quot;Which subjects would you like to set up?\r\n                               (Separate with spaces.) &quot;&quot;&quot;).split()))\r\n\r\nfor x in subjects:\r\n    timeOfSubject = input(&quot;What time is your &quot; + x + &quot;&quot;&quot; class? Enter in 24-hr\r\n                          time: &quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    fileName = input(&quot;&quot;&quot;Which file would you like to choose? Please include\r\n                     entire pathname of file: &quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    greeting = input(&quot;Leave yourself a start-up message! Enter: &quot;)\r\n    print(&quot;Registered!&quot;)\r\n\r\n# Setting up Document Opening Function\r\n\r\nfor x in subjects:\r\n    def openDocument():\r\n        print(greeting)\r\n        subprocess.call([&#39;open&#39;, fileName])\r\n    schedule.every().day.at(timeOfSubject).do(openDocument)\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile True:\r\n    schedule.run_pending()\r\n    time.sleep(2)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy output asks all the questions shown in the code above. E.g. if I answer `Which subjects would you like to set up?` with `English History Geography` it will ask me the series of questions for each of those subjects successfully.\r\n\r\nThe problem is once I have completed entering my subjects, and expect the code to run, nothing happens except for the last subject I entered. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m guessing it has something to do with the fact that it&#39;s the same source input in the code. How can I do this so it also accommodates for the fact that the user may wish to register an infinite amount of subjects?\r\n\r\nLooking forward to any and all suggestions, thanks in advance for the

Let there be the following options for a function f:\r\n```\r\ninterface Y { ... }\r\nclass SubY implements Y { ... }\r\nDEFINITION CHOICE:\r\npublic SubY f() { ... }\r\nOR\r\npublic Y f() { ... }\r\nUSAGE CHOICE:\r\n...\r\nY y = f();\r\nOR\r\nSubY y = f(); //maybe with a cast\r\n...\r\n```\r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Technically, all options can be correct, depending on whether you intend to expose the details of `SubY` to the end-user (next programmer) or not. If it looks like a bad idea to expose `SubY` to the end-user, don&#39;t. Otherwise, do. Here&#39;s the reasoning:  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; You should always return the narrowest type that could be needed, conceptually (narrower types are further down the [class hierarchy][1] - treat it as &quot;a narrower type is-a wider type&quot;). For example, if you return a `List`, that means that you expect the end-user to interact with it only in terms of an interface. However, if you expect that the end-user will need the interactions defined within `ArrayList`, return that instead.  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In general, the idea is to keeps the return type from methods as narrow as possible, without exposing gory details that the end-user shouldn&#39;t be aware of. As long as you properly hide the internal details handled by your class `SubY`, it is perfectly fine to return a `SubY`. On the other hand, consider the responsibility of the end-user:  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The responsibilty of the end-user is to responsibly use the power they&#39;ve been given by your narrow return type. You have already prevented them from doing nasty things by hiding internals properly. Then, when the end-user uses your class, they should program in terms of their needs, like so:\r\n```\r\n// imported library provides:\r\npublic SubY f() { ... }\r\n... // la la la\r\nY y = f();\r\nuseYFunctionality(y);\r\n... // somewhere else that you need SubY functionality\r\nSubY subY = f();\r\nuseSubYFunctionality(subY);\r\n```\r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Therefore, the programmer should define their functions to return precise types, returning the narrowest possible implementation that is safe (it *can* be an interface). On the other hand, the end-user of that service/functionality should define their variables as the widest possible type that still works, to decrease coupling and increase clarity of intent (if `getLicensePlateNumber` is all you need, use `Vehicle` instead of `VeryUnreliableCar`). The key here is that choosing the return type doesn&#39;t have a *definite* answer. Instead, use your judgment to decide what should and should not be exposed to the end-user. If there&#39;s no exceptional reason to deny access to `SubY`, then keep this principle in mind: `Functions Return Accurately, Users Define Variables As Necessary`, or FRAUDVAN.  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Applying this to your examples:\r\n```\r\nclass SubY_generalist implements Y\r\n{\r\n    public Y f()\r\n    {\r\n        Y y = new SubY_generalist();\r\n        ...\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n1. Using the interface everywhere. This is best when you only care about the details of the interface, and the same holds true for the end-user. For example, if you only care about `get` and `add`, `Y` could be `List`, and `SubY_generalist()` could be `ArrayList`.\r\n```\r\nclass SubY_mix implements Y\r\n{\r\n    public Y f()\r\n    {\r\n        SubY_mix y = new SubY_mix();\r\n        ...\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Using the specific type, but implicitly widening into the general type at return. This is best when you actually need to use methods for the specific type, but your end-user will *never* need to do so. Using `ArrayList` and `List` from the previous example, suppose `f` must invoke `trimToSize`, a method not defined in `List`. Then, it&#39;s clearly necessary to declare `y` as `ArrayList`. However, since the end-user only needs the `List`, you should return `y` and implicitly widen.\r\n```\r\nclass SubY_specialist implements Y\r\n{\r\n    public SubY_specialist f()\r\n    {\r\n        SubY_specialist y = new SubY_specialist();\r\n        ...\r\n        return y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3. Using the specialized type, and returning the specialized type. This is the &quot;essence&quot; of FRAUDVAN. `SubY_specialist` as the return type allows the user the flexibility to deal with the `SubY_specialist` returned, or alternatively use `f()` in terms of the interface `Y`. This is *incredibly common*, when interfaces are insufficiently specific to be used effectively (as they should be, since they&#39;re *abstract*). For example, in the Java [`Stream`][2] class, any time a method returns a `Stream`, this is happening. This is because `Stream` implements [`BaseStream`][3]. It *also* happens any time you take a `StringBuffer` and `reverse`, `append`, `replace`, `delete`, or `insert` (`StringBuffer` implements `CharSequence`).  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The reason this kind of behavior is needed is that interfaces often don&#39;t contain enough details to be utilized effectively by the end-user. Putting those details in interfaces would result in interface bloat/pollution, which is undesirable. Instead, directly having the class responsible for those details be used preserves the single responsibility principle for classes that have unique functionalities (avoiding being forced to implement redundancy in future implementers of the interface). After all, if your class implements two interfaces, you either have to create a new interface extending both those interfaces and return that (which can get ugly pretty quickly), or you can return the implementor, and have the end-user be responsible for which interface they need (not ugly).  \r\n &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Why is this kind of behavior so common? It&#39;s because, once you hide away things that end-users don&#39;t need to see (using visibility modifiers, encapsulation, and information hiding), it&#39;s actually a *good idea* to let end-users interact with your implementations in the manner that they choose (i.e. as per the interface they declare their variable as). In fact, I&#39;d even claim that all examples here are compliant to FRAUDVAN, where the &quot;safest&quot; type to expose to the user is `Y` instead of a specialized type. In the first example, the interface `Y` is sufficiently specialized for the user and the end-users. In the second example, `Y` is insufficiently specialized for the user, but sufficiently specialized for the end-users. Finally, in this example, `Y` is insufficiently specialized for the user and all end-users, although some end-users may choose to declare `Y y = f()` if `Y` will suit their needs.\r\n\r\nSo, here&#39;s the take away:  \r\n![FRAUDVAN][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_hierarchy\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/Stream.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/13/docs/api/java.base/java/util/stream/BaseStream.html\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/zrrGY.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325692/how-do-you-flexibly-retain-useful-object-functionality-between-the-usage-and-def/58329135#58329135","title":"How do you flexibly retain useful object functionality between the usage and definition of a method?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":2108477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f30268b2a1d0a8a18012e602cd3cb783?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ignat Insarov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2108477/ignat-insarov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2397,"user_id":2108477,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f30268b2a1d0a8a18012e602cd3cb783?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ignat Insarov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2108477/ignat-insarov"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58329135,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570736683,"creation_date":1570719033,"last_edit_date":1570736404,"question_id":58325692,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325692","body_markdown":"### Exposition:\r\n\r\nSuppose I have this trivial interface:\r\n\r\n    interface Y { Y f(); }\r\n\r\nI can implement it in 3 different ways:\r\n\r\n1.

The most promoted answers do not seem to go deep into the distinction between\r\nargument and return types, which are in fact [fundamentally distinct][2]. Finding therefore that\r\nthe discussion elsewhere does not provide me with a clean-cut answer, I have no choice but to\r\nspeculate on it by myself — unless the kind reader can lend me a hand, of course.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/383947/what-does-it-mean-to-program-to-an-interface\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)\r\n\r\nI will assume the following basic facts about Java: _(Are they correct?)_\r\n\r\n1. An object is created at its most special.\r\n2. It may be implicitly cast into a more general type _(generalized)_ at any time.\r\n3. When an object is generalized, it loses some of its useful properties, but gains none.\r\n\r\nFrom these simple points, it follows that a special object is more useful, but also more dangerous\r\nthan the general.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I may have a mutable container that I can generalize into being\r\nimmutable. If I ensure the container has some useful properties before being thus frozen, I can\r\ngeneralize it at the right time to prevent the user from accidentally breaking the invariant. But\r\nis this the right way? There is another way to achieve similar isolation: I may always just make\r\nmy methods _package-private_. Generalizing seems to be more flexible but easy to omiss and\r\nintroduce a surface for subtle bugs.\r\n\r\nBut in some languages, like Python, it is deemed unnecessary to ever actually protect methods from\r\noutside access; they just label the internal methods with an underscore. A proficient user may\r\naccess the internal methods to achieve some gain, provided that they know all the intricacies.\r\n\r\nAnother consequence is that inside the method definitions I should prefer specialized objects.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n### My questions:\r\n\r\n* Is this right thinking?\r\n* Am I missing something?\r\n* How does this relate to the talk of _programming to an interface_? Some locals here seem to\r\n  think it is relevant, and I agree that it does, just not immediately, as I see it. It is more\r\n  like _programming against an interface_ here, or _against a subclass_ in general. I am a bit at\r\n  a loss about these intricacies.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325692/how-do-you-flexibly-retain-useful-object-functionality-between-the-usage-and-def","title":"How do you flexibly retain useful object functionality between the usage and definition of a method?"},{"tags":["java","jsp","servlets","canvasjs"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9709558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f89678c5f4b3277577e84ef47d3dbb0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Azael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9709558/azael"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571122396,"creation_date":1571122396,"answer_id":58388817,"question_id":58325691,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58388817","body_markdown":"My Error was to think that script and scriptlets are similar and that I can see the finished graph when running the jsp file.

I found a function to export graphs as pdf, but because the graphs were not available to me directly, as they are in iframes, I am not able to use the inbuild export function.\r\n\r\n## What I tried ##\r\nI was able to get the html element where the graphs are being rendered, and then I tried to initialize it as a Highcharts object again, so as to use the in-built export function. I was able to easily initialize using this code :\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar graphobject = $(&quot;graph-container&quot;).highcharts();\r\n```\r\n\r\nit returns me a highcharts object, which I am able to pass to this function and it exports my graph as pdf on click of the button.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(&#39;#export-pdf&#39;).click(function () {\r\n\t\tHighcharts.exportCharts([grapharray], {\r\n\t\t\ttype: &#39;application/pdf&#39;\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t});\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Here is a fiddle for it.][1]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n## The problem ##\r\n\r\nNow, to ignore cors-header warnings, I created a django server and hosted my 2 html files, one with just 2 graphs, and other with the button. I used this code to get my html object, \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(&#39;myIframeContent&#39;);\r\nvar innerDoc = iframe.contentDocument || iframe.contentWindow.document;\r\nvar graphdivs = innerDoc.getElementsByClassName(&quot;graph-container&quot;);\r\n\r\nvar test = $(graphdiv).highcharts();\r\nconsole.log(test);\r\n\r\n\r\nvar graphobject = []\r\nfor (var i = 0; i &lt; graphdivs.length; i++)\r\n   graphobject[i] = $(graphdivs[i]).highcharts();         ## this line does not work or throw any error\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut when I am trying to initialize it as highcharts objects, I get no response, no error, and they are not converted to highcharts objects. Whay should I do ?? is the the correct method ? I feel I am very close to this solution, yet so far.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Here is a fiddle with my code.

Firebase Phone Auth - Handles all of the steps of phone auth for you - generates an SMS code and sends the SMS, reads the text message for the user (when possible), logs the user in and returns you an FirebaseUser. You cannot define the message contents. Free to use up to 10k uses per month. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: If you&#39;re already sending your own SMS messages, use the SMS Retriever API for better UX. If you want the full validation flow handled for you, use Firebase Auth. I hope that that helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325657/automatic-sms-verification-with-the-sms-retriever-api-vs-authenticate-with-fi/58439436#58439436","title":"&quot;Automatic SMS Verification with the SMS Retriever API&quot; vs &quot;Authenticate with Firebase using a Phone Number&quot;"}],"owner":{"reputation":1834,"user_id":6813231,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gy8Sg.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"a_subscriber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6813231/a-subscriber"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58439436,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571340070,"creation_date":1570718934,"last_edit_date":1570726639,"question_id":58325657,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325657","body_markdown":"On my andoird app to do Automatic SMS Verification I can use this:\r\n\r\n*&quot;Automatic SMS Verification with the SMS Retriever API&quot;*\r\n\r\nhttps://developers.google.com/identity/sms-retriever/overview\r\n\r\nNice.\r\n\r\nBut to do Automatic SMS Verification I can also use Firebase:\r\n\r\n*&quot;Authenticate with Firebase on Android using a Phone Number&quot;*\r\n\r\nhttps://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/android/phone-auth\r\n\r\nWhat is difference between this two approaches?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325657/automatic-sms-verification-with-the-sms-retriever-api-vs-authenticate-with-fi","title":"&quot;Automatic SMS Verification with the SMS Retriever API&quot; vs &quot;Authenticate with Firebase using a Phone Number&quot;"},{"tags":["jupyter-notebook","pymysql"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7438523,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/098586e8ba0ade8b341e1bc2e05037a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jappudesi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7438523/jappudesi"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570718925,"creation_date":1570718925,"question_id":58325653,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325653","body_markdown":"I have a localhost database which I was able to connect to using pymysql till last week, using jupyter notebook on ubuntu 19.10.

in background.\r\n\r\nThen if your app `is put into background`, Apple has strict limit to allow apps running in the background. [background-tasks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/ios-backgrounding-with-tasks#creating-background-safe-tasks) has time limits, you can read the document about more information.

For example, app that needs to `play music` in background, `update location` in background and etc. You can see the [Application Registration Categories here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/ios-backgrounding-techniques/registering-applications-to-run-in-background#application-registration-categories). If your app meets the requirement there, you can apply for a background running permission from system.\r\n\r\nRefer: [Backgrounding in Xamarin.iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/ios/app-fundamentals/backgrounding/)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325614/how-to-perform-a-simple-background-task-on-xamarin-ios/58333538#58333538","title":"How to perform a simple background task on Xamarin iOS"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":10945713,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a9d1ce096b5fa79e31e444cdd137905?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jhardy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10945713/jhardy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58333538,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570794082,"creation_date":1570718752,"question_id":58325614,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325614","body_markdown":"In our app users can track and submit journeys they have recorded. I need a simple way of creating a task in iOS. I have already created and tested this on Android. It works via:\r\n\r\n- The user selects the journeys they would like to submit.\r\n- Taps sync and a foreground service is created that syncs the journeys to our API.\r\n- This service will continue to sync journeys even if the app is put into the background or even closed.\r\n\r\nSo in short how can i achieve this on iOS 9-13?\r\n\r\nI have already tried creating a background-safe tasks using:\r\n\r\nnint taskID = UIApplication.SharedApplication.BeginBackgroundTask( () =&gt; {});\r\n\r\nHowever, this only gives the task 2 mins to run which isn&#39;t enough. I have looked into the NSURlSessions but they require URls, whereas we are using our own API wrapper.\r\n\r\nI would simply like a way of creating a task when the user taps &#39;sync&#39; and this task also being capable to run in the background.

only glanced through your code, but I have done things like this many times in the past.  My general approach for this is as follows (although it adds a small cost) ...\r\n\r\n1. add a print statement in a way (perhaps with a mod counter) that you would expect the print to come out approximately once every 2 to 3 minutes.  Include some information in the print so that you can tell how far along your simulation is progressing.  (note, among that information you probably want to be sure to print out variables that, if they get trashed, could cause infinite looping, for example &quot;Dimention&quot; (which you have misspelled btw)\r\n\r\n2. I would personally not have jumped from 5 cities to 17.  Rather 5 to 7, then maybe 9 or 10 ... just to confirm all is working and to get an idea how much time increase to expect with your particular CPU.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the situation you are in now, is it possible to get another window and run &quot;ps&quot; to see if your job is getting any CPU time?   If not, my approach would be to kill it and implement as I described above.  HTH.\r\n\r\nNote also, the code you have omitted (memory allocation, etc) *is critical*:  the code as written has the potential to go out of bounds, and possibly *not* crash (if only slightly out of bounds) but rather end up trashing variables (depending on memory layout) that could (as mentioned above) create an infinite or near-infinite loop.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325612/program-is-taking-way-longer-than-expected-is-it-running-properly/58325818#58325818","title":"Program is taking way longer than expected, is it running properly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":12106741,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4a4e871cf53ba4db5ba454207c69dc24?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bruno SIgnori","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106741/bruno-signori"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":67,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58325818,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570719894,"creation_date":1570718744,"question_id":58325612,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325612","body_markdown":"not sure this is the right place...\r\nI am running a brute-force code to solve an asymmetric traveler sales problem.\r\nIt has 17 cities, one is fixed, so it would have 16!

I would like to able reconnect edge to another port as it is standard with default vertex.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325602/can-not-reconnect-port-in-official-mxgraph-example","title":"Can not reconnect port in official mxGraph example"},{"tags":["mysql","json","sql-insert","mysql-8.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":11694201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8bcmaYY4U7k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfbjo5oX4lN1K1H_z7ony8gQAODxA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bruno Souza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11694201/bruno-souza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570721312,"post_id":58325601,"comment_id":103011183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325601/mysql-nested-json-insert-into-issue#comment103011183_58325601"},{"owner":{"reputation":333,"user_id":2458731,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb67a2d9b933b2fd90d3fe8aec8e7ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Markuz Shultz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2458731/markuz-shultz"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":82,"user_id":11694201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8bcmaYY4U7k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfbjo5oX4lN1K1H_z7ony8gQAODxA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bruno Souza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11694201/bruno-souza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570722119,"post_id":58325601,"comment_id":103011631,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325601/mysql-nested-json-insert-into-issue#comment103011631_58325601"},{"owner":{"reputation":82,"user_id":11694201,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-8bcmaYY4U7k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfbjo5oX4lN1K1H_z7ony8gQAODxA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Bruno Souza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11694201/bruno-souza"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570722625,"post_id":58325601,"comment_id":103011899,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58325601/mysql-nested-json-insert-into-issue#comment103011899_58325601"}],"owner":{"reputation":333,"user_id":2458731,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cb67a2d9b933b2fd90d3fe8aec8e7ed1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Markuz Shultz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2458731/markuz-shultz"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570718708,"creation_date":1570718708,"question_id":58325601,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58325601","body_markdown":"I&#39;m sending an object to the stored procedure and there I&#39;m doing INSERT_INTO table, everything working fine until I added a new field.\r\n\r\nPreviously JSON looked something like this: \r\n\r\n    &#39;[{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;asdsadsa&quot;, &quot;something&quot;: &quot;asdasdasd&quot;}]&#39;\r\n    \r\nNow I added a new field that is a JSON object and this is how it looks parsed from the Server sent to the stored procedure (JSON.stringify):\r\n\r\n    &#39;[{ &quot;id&quot;: &quot;asdsadsa&quot;, &quot;somedata&quot;: &quot;{\\&quot;newField\\&quot;:\\&quot;something\\&quot;}}&quot;]&#39;\r\n\r\nAnd I&#39;m mapping this filed inside the stored procedure like this \r\n\r\n    somedata JSON PATH &quot;$.somedata&quot;\r\n\r\nAfter Adding this field I started getting this issue \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XJ9vo.png\r\n\r\nNOTE!!: IF I remove &quot;&quot;

You are reading CSV Data to do a web page form filling.\r\n\r\n**Problem** is this code is not reading the data from the start when the page refreshes.\r\n\r\nTry to read the data at once. Write to a file, for all the completed records.\r\n\r\n**Option1:**\r\nThe simple  option - Try to split this large CSV files into smaller files. Say if you can update 550 records before a page goes for refresh then update 500 records and wait out till the page is refreshed ! \r\n\r\n\r\n**Option2:**\r\nCan you actually have a way to check if the page is going to refresh? If it is possible then do this\r\n\r\nKeep a counter of how many records are updated.
