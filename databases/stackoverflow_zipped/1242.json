The client asked to migrate to FCM, so i did. And its mostly working perfectly. Im receiving notifications and, when the app is in the foreground, the notifications get saved. With the app in the background the notifications are still arriving without any trouble but in this case its not saving into database.\r\n\r\nSo i started with this:\r\n \r\n    @Override\r\n    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {\r\n        \r\n        Timber.d(&quot;RECIEVED&quot;);\r\n\r\n        RemoteMessage.Notification n = remoteMessage.getNotification();\r\n        if (n != null) {\r\n\r\n            Notification notification = new Notification();\r\n            notification.setTitle(n.getTitle());\r\n            notification.setMessage(n.getBody());\r\n            notification.setDate(System.currentTimeMillis());\r\n\r\n            NotificationDAO dao = new NotificationDAO(MyApp.getInstance());\r\n            dao.create(notification);\r\n\r\n            showNotification(n.getTitle(), n.getBody());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo i thought the problem could be on the context, so i tried replacing `MyApp.getInstance()` with `getApplicationContext()`. That wasnt working, so then i changed `getApplicationContext()` with `this`. As it wasnt working neither i tried to do this access inside another thread, but none its working.\r\n\r\nWhat am i doing wrong?

However, I suggest you do not do this because your Celery tasks may affect the execution of Airflow DAGs, and it may affect the SLAs.\r\n\r\nWhat we do in the company I work for is exactly what you suggested - we maintain a large Celery cluster, and we sometimes offload execution of some Airflow tasks to our Celery cluster, depending on the use-case.

This works remarkably well especially when having the worker nodes sit in an autoscaling group on EC2.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Airflow, I use plain Celery to handle simple asynchronous tasks (that don&#39;t need a whole pipeline) coming from Flask/Python. Until now, these plain Celery tasks were very low volume and I just ran the plain Celery worker on the same machine as Flask. There is now a requirement to run a massive number of plain Celery tasks in the system, so I need to scale my plain Celery as well.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this would be to run the plain Celery worker service on the Airflow worker servers as well (to benefit from the autoscaling etc.) but this doesn&#39;t seem to be an elegant solution since it creates two different &quot;types&quot; of Celery worker on the same machine. My question is whether there is some combination of configuration settings I can pass to my plain Celery app that will cause @celery.task decorated functions to be executed directly on my Airflow worker cluster as a plain Celery task, completely bypassing the Airflow middleware.\r\n\r\nThanks for the

Given that data is different I have increased the timeout from 15 seconds to 2 minutes.\r\n\r\nI have arranged a reboot to see if that fixes it, but I have run out of things to check.\r\n\r\n---\r\nEdit: I did think of one further check, could I add the image of a page not on the site (https://www.google.co.uk/), doing this resulted in the same error so it appears not to be a blocking issue on the worker process.\n\n—\nEdit2: switched to the gecko engine and it is now working.

We use socket io for some functions because it&#39;s required for showing users online status.\r\n\r\n\r\nView users component ts \r\n\r\n    constructor(\r\n        public nav: HeaderService,\r\n        private usersService: UsersService,\r\n        private route: ActivatedRoute,\r\n        protected tokenService: TokenService) {\r\n        this.socket = io(URL);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      ngOnInit() {\r\n        this.nav.show();\r\n        this.user = this.tokenService.GetPayload();\r\n        this.socket.emit(&#39;online&#39;, { room: &#39;global&#39;, user: this.user.username });\r\n        this.socket.on(&#39;refreshPage&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n          this.GetUserData(this.name);\r\n        });\r\n        if (this.user) {\r\n          this.GetUserById(this.user);\r\n          this.route.params.subscribe(params =&gt; {\r\n            this.name = params.name;\r\n            this.GetUserData(this.name);\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n        this.socket.on(&#39;refreshPage&#39;, data =&gt; {\r\n          this.route.params.subscribe(params =&gt; {\r\n            this.name = params.name;\r\n            this.GetUserData(this.name);\r\n          });\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      public ngAfterViewInit() {\r\n        this.socket.on(&#39;usersOnline&#39;, data =&gt; {\r\n          this.onlineusers = data;\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      GetUserById(user) {\r\n        this.usersService.GetUserById(user._id).subscribe(\r\n          data =&gt; {\r\n            this.user = data.result;\r\n            this.imageId = data.result.picId;\r\n            this.imageVersion = data.result.picVersion;\r\n            this.images = data.result.images;\r\n          },\r\n          err =&gt; console.log(err)\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      GetUserData(name) {\r\n        this.usersService.GetUserByName(name).subscribe(\r\n          data =&gt; {\r\n            this.user = data.result;\r\n            this.imageId = data.result.picId;\r\n            this.imageVersion = data.result.picVersion;\r\n            this.images = data.result.images;\r\n          },\r\n          err =&gt; console.log(err)\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n\r\nI assume HTML part is not required since it worked fine earlier.

Since the last PyCharm update, I&#39;ve been finding that when I reopen a project, the main window fails to retain its previous maximised state.  It also resizes the project tool window.  It&#39;s a minor annoyance, and doesn&#39;t prevent me from working, but I&#39;d like to fix it.\r\n\r\nOne thought.  I&#39;m also using the settings repository plugin to share settings across multiple PCs, for IntelliJ, PyCharm and Android Studio.  Maybe the settings are getting confused, and clearing out the settings Git repo would fix this?  But I don&#39;t want to try this before getting advice from the community.\r\n\r\n* PyCharm 2019.2.3 (latest)\r\n* Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen JetBrains products doing this before, but it&#39;s gone away with software updates.

I mean what could possibly be wrong with the above chunk?!... and why was this working on all iOSes until the latest iOS13!?... \r\n\r\n5) Checked all spelling, re-ordered the list to make it similar to another one that does work, changed the keyboard type, other items,... started-Stopped, checked settings, same thing,... still crashing!... \r\n\r\n6) Finally, I changed the variable name from &quot;Admin_iTaxi Server Port&quot; to &quot;Admin_iTaxi Server XXXPort&quot;, re-compiled, and it worked... hmmm... why!?... \r\n\r\n7) Went back into the startup code, and noticed that I am setting the variables (if they don&#39;t exists) with the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n    if (!IsConfigKeyExist(@&quot;Admin_iTaxi Server Port&quot;))\r\n    {\r\n            TempServerPortAdmin = 8102;\r\n            [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setInteger:TempServerPortAdmin forKey:@&quot;Admin_iTaxi Server Port&quot;];\r\n    }\r\n\r\n8) I then thought, the info.plist file has KEYs and TYPEs, all are set as &lt;STRING&gt;, can&#39;t remember setting any &lt;INTEGER&gt; or &lt;INT&gt; etc, therefore. \r\n\r\n9) Changed the code above into: \r\n\r\nif (!IsConfigKeyExist(@&quot;Admin_iTaxi Server Port&quot;))\r\n{\r\n    TempServerPortAdmin = 8102;\r\n    [[NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] setValue:[NSString stringWithFormat:@&quot;%li&quot;, TempServerPortAdmin] forKey:@&quot;Admin_iTaxi Server Port&quot;];\r\n}\r\n\r\n10) Restored the original variable name on the info.plist, start-stop-check, ... Eureeka,.. it now works... \r\n\r\nConclusion: somehow down the line Apple in their wisdom decided to crash the settings app when they read an Integer into a String variable... why!?... I have no idea, but the fix (as mentioned above), is NOT to store your settings as &quot;Integer&quot; and infect only store as &quot;String&quot; especially if you are going to use these settings in your info.plist file. \r\n\r\nThis solves the problem of the app&#39;s settings crashing with EXC_BREAKPOINT (SIGTRAP)\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\nGood luck!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246927/ios13-ipad-settings-crashing-for-already-paid-app/58248150#58248150","title":"IOS13 iPad Settings crashing for already paid app"}],"owner":{"reputation":1385,"user_id":1915577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af9e2baa06be7725bfe424202d875a80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Heider Sati","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1915577/heider-sati"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1385,"user_id":1915577,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af9e2baa06be7725bfe424202d875a80?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Heider Sati","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1915577/heider-sati"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":75,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58248150,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570517974,"creation_date":1570266965,"last_edit_date":1570517974,"question_id":58246927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58246927","body_markdown":"Our apps on the AppStore have been running for years without any issues.

isn&#39;t one definitive answer as to why you need a state variable and set it to -1 each time you enter your switch statement. But I can think of one example where you would really need the variable.\r\n\r\nLike I said in the comment section, the compiler isn&#39;t aware and doesn&#39;t really care what &lt;&gt;2__current does.\r\n\r\nIt might be a long-running web request to download a file. It might be the result of a calculation or it might just be an integer as in your example. But here lies the problem, because the compiler isn&#39;t aware of what your code does, it might throw an exception. Let&#39;s look at an example of what would happen if you omitted the _state variable and you would run into an exception trying to download something.\r\n\r\n\r\n    1) MoveNext is called.\r\n    2) this.&lt;&gt;2_current = WebRequest.GetFileAsync() throws HttpRequestException.\r\n    3) The exception is caught somewhere and the execution of the program is resumed.\r\n    4) The caller invokes MoveNext method.\r\n    5) this.&lt;&gt;2_current = WebRequest.GetFileAsync() throws HttpRequestException\r\n\r\nSo in this case, we would be stuck in a loop because the state would be changed only after successfully downloading that data.\r\n\r\nWhen we introduce the _state variable the result looks a lot different.\r\n\r\n    1) MoveNext is called.\r\n    2) this.&lt;&gt;2_current = WebRequest.GetFileAsync() throws HttpRequestException.\r\n    3) The exception is caught somewhere and execution of the program is resumed.\r\n    4) The caller invokes MoveNext method.\r\n\r\n    5) Since there’s no switch case for -1, the default block is reached which informs about the end of a sequence.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246922/why-the-compiler-generated-state-machine-restores-repeatedly-the-state-to-1/58248491#58248491","title":"Why the compiler-generated state machine restores repeatedly the state to -1?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"comment_count":13,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58248491,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570280094,"creation_date":1570266876,"last_edit_date":1570267234,"question_id":58246922,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58246922","body_markdown":"I am trying to understand how the iterators work internally, to mitigate some concerns I have about thread-safety. Lets consider for example the following\r\nsimple iterator:\r\n\r\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n\r\n    public class MyClass\r\n    {\r\n        public static IEnumerable&lt;int&gt; MyMethod()\r\n        {\r\n            yield return 10;\r\n            yield return 20;\r\n            yield return 30;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can see the compiler-generated state machine that is created behind the scenes, after copy-pasting this code to [SharpLab.io][1]. It is a class that implements the interfaces `IEnumerable&lt;int&gt;` and `IEnumerator&lt;int&gt;`, and contains the [`MoveNext`][3] method below:\r\n\r\n    private bool MoveNext()\r\n    {\r\n        switch (&lt;&gt;1__state)\r\n        {\r\n            default:\r\n                return false;\r\n            case 0:\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = -1;\r\n                &lt;&gt;2__current = 10;\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = 1;\r\n                return true;\r\n            case 1:\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = -1;\r\n                &lt;&gt;2__current = 20;\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = 2;\r\n                return true;\r\n            case 2:\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = -1;\r\n                &lt;&gt;2__current = 30;\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = 3;\r\n                return true;\r\n            case 3:\r\n                &lt;&gt;1__state = -1;\r\n                return false;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe identifiers `&lt;&gt;1__state` and `&lt;&gt;2__current` are private fields of this class:\r\n\r\n    private int &lt;&gt;1__state;\r\n    private int &lt;&gt;2__current;\r\n\r\nI noticed a pattern in this code. At first the value of the `&lt;&gt;1__state` field is restored to -1, then the `&lt;&gt;2__current` is assigned to the next iteration value, then the `&lt;&gt;1__state` is advanced to the next state. My question is: what is the purpose of the `&lt;&gt;1__state = -1;` line? I compiled this code (after painfully renaming all the illegal identifiers) and confirmed that this line can be commented-out without affecting the functionality of the class. I don&#39;t believe that the C# compiler team just forgot this seemingly purposeless piece of code hanging around there. Surely there must be a purpose for its existence, and I would like to know what this purpose is.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I&#39;ve attempted some modifications to compensate for v2 authentication methods used in the example, but hit a dead end.\r\n\r\nWhat is the proper way to use v1 methods via PHP?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58126932/problem-in-gcp-setiampolicy-api-reference-under-php-example\r\n  [2]: https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/reference/rest/v1/projects/setIamPolicy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246887/using-gcp-api-php-client-v1-methods","title":"using GCP api php client v1 methods"},{"tags":["elasticsearch","kibana"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570286102,"post_id":58248132,"comment_id":102869161,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#comment102869161_58248132"},{"owner":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570289390,"post_id":58248132,"comment_id":102869982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#comment102869982_58248132"},{"owner":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570342398,"post_id":58248132,"comment_id":102878959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#comment102878959_58248132"},{"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570435134,"post_id":58248132,"comment_id":102898666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#comment102898666_58248132"},{"owner":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570439889,"post_id":58248132,"comment_id":102900633,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#comment102900633_58248132"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4019,"user_id":3838328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OoqXG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3838328/kamal"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570439852,"last_edit_date":1570439852,"creation_date":1570277232,"answer_id":58248132,"question_id":58246884,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58248132","body_markdown":"What I understood is that you would want to collate list of documents having same `app_id` along with the `status` as either `STARTED` or `FINISHED`. \r\n\r\nI do not think Elasticsearch is not meant to perform JOIN operations.

Whenever you would need exact matches or want to make use of aggregation, you would need to make use of `keyword` type. \r\n\r\nIn the mapping you&#39;ve shared, ***there is no `username` field but two `event_type` fields***. I&#39;m assuming its just a human err and that one of the field should be `username`.\r\n\r\nNow if you notice carefully, the field `event_type` has a `text` and its sibling `keyword` field. I&#39;ve just modified the query to make use of the keyword field and when I am doing that, I&#39;m use [Term Query][6]. \r\n\r\nTry this out and let me know if it helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/joining-queries.html\r\n  [2]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations.html\r\n  [3]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html\r\n  [4]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-bucket-terms-aggregation.html\r\n  [5]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-aggregations-metrics-top-hits-aggregation.html\r\n  [6]: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-term-query.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246884/elasticsearch-join-data-within-the-same-index/58248132#58248132","title":"ElasticSearch join data within the same index"}],"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":301,"user_id":3737163,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1474804059/picture?type=large","display_name":"alexlipa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737163/alexlipa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58248132,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570439852,"creation_date":1570266573,"last_edit_date":1570435114,"question_id":58246884,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58246884","body_markdown":"I am quite new with ElasticSearch and I am collecting some application logs within the same index which have this format\r\n\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;_index&quot; : &quot;app_logs&quot;,\r\n        &quot;_type&quot; : &quot;_doc&quot;,\r\n        &quot;_id&quot; : &quot;JVMYi20B0a2qSId4rt12&quot;,\r\n        &quot;_source&quot; : {\r\n          &quot;username&quot; : &quot;mapred&quot;,\r\n          &quot;app_id&quot; : &quot;application_1569623930006_490200&quot;,\r\n          &quot;event_type&quot; : &quot;STARTED&quot;,\r\n          &quot;ts&quot; : &quot;2019-10-02T08:11:53Z&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can have different event types.

have a google sheet of categories. \r\n\r\n[Google Sheets of nested Categories][1]\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3OAi5.png / And I exported this to a csv file resulting in this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSubstructure,,,\r\n,Foundations,,\r\n,,Standard Foundations,\r\n,,,Wall Foundations   \r\n,,,Column Foundations   \r\n,,,Standard Foundation Supplementary Components   \r\n,,Special Foundations,\r\n,,,Driven Piles   \r\n,,,Bored Piles   \r\n,,,Caissons   \r\n,,,Special Foundation Walls   \r\n,,,Foundation Anchors   \r\n,,,Underpinning   \r\n,,,Raft Foundations   \r\n,,,Pile Caps   \r\n,,,Grade Beams\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing Python, I would like to convert this CSV file into a nested dictionary with the following format:\r\n```\r\ncategories = [\r\n    {\r\n      id: 0,\r\n      title: &#39;parent&#39;\r\n    }, {\r\n      id: 1,\r\n      title: &#39;parent&#39;,\r\n      subs: [\r\n        {\r\n          id: 10,\r\n          title: &#39;child&#39;\r\n

title: &#39;parent&#39;\r\n    },\r\n    // more data here\r\n];\r\n```\r\nSo, to be clear, each csv row should be added to a dictionary like this: {id:x,title:y}, and if it has children, it should look like this: {id:x,title:y,subs:[comma separated children dicts]}.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve spent about a day and a half on this using similar questions on here, but they are all just too different for my current level of skills to make them work for this. I feel terrible and would really appreciate some help. If possible, I&#39;d like to use the solution on other scenarios as well, with varying  levels of children. This example has three levels for children, some have only two or one. \r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246880/how-can-i-convert-a-csv-file-which-is-nested-by-means-of-columns-to-a-nested-d","title":"How can I convert a CSV file, which is nested by means of columns, to a nested dictionary with Python?"},{"tags":["c#",".net","forms","dictionary","gmap.net"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":6493587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d578875680d7ef1d1e868ad4e75a6124?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Anthony","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6493587/anthony"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2304,"user_id":12031933,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TkXU7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Olivier Rogier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031933/olivier-rogier"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570266586,"creation_date":1570266443,"last_edit_date":1570266586,"question_id":58246876,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58246876","body_markdown":"GMap control goes out of bounds when dragging with cursor.

It&#39;s easier to explain that way.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE NGRAM_CONTENT\r\n(\r\n    event_id     BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    ref   TEXT NOT NULL,\r\n    data         TEXT\r\n);\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE NGRAM\r\n(\r\n    event_id  BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    ngram   TEXT NOT NULL ,\r\n    ref     TEXT not null,\r\n    name_length INT not null,\r\n) ;\r\n\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (1, &#39;p1&#39;, &#39;a data 1&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (2, &#39;p1&#39;, &#39;a data 2&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (3, &#39;p1&#39;, null);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (4, &#39;p2&#39;, &#39;b data 1&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (5, &#39;p2&#39;, &#39;b data 2&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (6, &#39;p2&#39;, &#39;c data 1&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM_CONTENT(event_id, ref, data) values (7, &#39;p2&#39;, &#39;c data 2&#39;);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;p1&#39;, 1, 10);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;p1&#39;, 2, 12);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;b&#39;, &#39;p1&#39;, 2, 13);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;b&#39;, &#39;p2&#39;, 4, 8);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;b&#39;, &#39;p2&#39;, , 10);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;c&#39;, &#39;p2&#39;, 6, 20);\r\ninsert into NGRAM(ngram, ref, event_id, name_length) values (&#39;c&#39;, &#39;p2&#39;, 7, 50);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere are the tables of example input and desired output\r\n```\r\n| ngram  | event_id | output     |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;| &lt; 2      | &#39;a data 1&#39; |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;| &lt; 3      | &#39;a data 2&#39; |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;| &lt; 4      | null       |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;    | -        | null       |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;    | -        | null       |\r\n| &#39;b&#39;    | -        | null       |\r\n| &#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;| -        | null       |\r\n| &#39;b&#39;    | &lt; 5      | b data 1   |\r\n| &#39;c&#39;    | &lt; 7      | c data 1   |\r\n| &#39;c&#39;    | -        | c data 2   |\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve got the following query that worked. (I didn&#39;t mention `name_length` above, as it&#39;s just complicated example). Need to replace that 100000000 with an event_id above and also the values for searching of ngram\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith max_matched_event_id_and_ref_from_index as\r\n         (\r\n             -- getting max event id and ref for all the potential matches\r\n             select max(event_id) as max_matched_event_id, ref\r\n             from ngram\r\n             where name_length between 14 and 18 and\r\n               ngram in (&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;)\r\n             and event_id &lt;

It should contain every column from\r\n&quot;your&quot; list.\r\n\r\nIf some columns are missing, correct the title row accordingly and run your\r\nprogram again.\r\n\r\nAnother possible source of error can be an **extra spaces** after commas\r\n(or at the beginning of this row).\r\nUnfortunately, *read_csv* is not clever enough to filter out such spaces.\r\nThis function just splits the title row on the separator char (in this case a comma)\r\nand each resulting &quot;segment&quot; becomes the name of respective column.\r\n\r\nIn the above case, these extra spaces become initial chars in column names.\r\n\r\nYet another possible source of error is that the source file **does not contain**\r\nany title row.\r\nIn this case you should pass to *read_csv* your own list of column names\r\n(*names* parameter) it the order corresponding to actual content of the input file.\r\n\r\nNote also that *sep=&#39;,&#39;* is not needed, as *&#39;,&#39;* is just the default\r\nvalue of this parameter.

Let me tell you about my goal. First, a little be of problem context:\r\n\r\n- ObservableCollection is on a viemModel, for example ObservableCollection&lt;&quot;Customer&quot;&gt;. \r\n- The collection is Bind to a Xamarin CollectionView, showing some Customer info and a button to update Customer status.\r\n- In response to Button click event I use Rest services and to do a Post for updating the clicked customer.\r\n- Post method return a new item: the modified Customer\r\n\r\nAt this point, i wonder the best way to update collection so my user interface is refreshed.\r\n\r\nI know i can update  properties on Item but to get this way working i must implement INotifyPropertyChange on my Customer (POCO object). It&#39;s not a problem, but sometimes there is a lot of properties updated by Rest service and i would prefer to replace the edited customer in ObservableCollection with the new one returned by Post method and not updating properties one by one.\r\n\r\nSo, i replace the object on collection with this code, and is working fine:\r\n\r\n    var index = viewModel.Items.IndexOf(originalCustomer);\r\n    viewModel.Items[index] = updatedCustomer;\r\n\r\nBut this way involve to get the index of item to be replaced using Collection.IndexOf(customer) and that&#39;s seems to be an O(n) operation. **&#191;There is any way to get the index of clicked customer directly on click event with O(1) complexity?**\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246845/optimal-way-to-replace-observablecollection-item-when-user-click-on-databound-co","title":"Optimal way to replace ObservableCollection item when user click on databound CollectionView item"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":18631,"user_id":8472377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7BpS7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Austin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8472377/austin"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570266384,"post_id":58246840,"comment_id":102864940,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246840/tuple-comparison-looks-inconsistent#comment102864940_58246840"},{"owner":{"reputation":4592,"user_id":415016,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":29,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48e653222e0c86dbb4947ea2ea926ff9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"balderman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/415016/balderman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570266520,"post_id":58246840,"comment_id":102864964,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58246840/tuple-comparison-looks-inconsistent#comment102864964_58246840"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":10861325,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8394c9b1ff979dfe5210aa167c1b5c0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rajesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10861325/rajesh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":83498,"user_id":3001761,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/feZwC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jonrsharpe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3001761/jonrsharpe"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570266517,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570266461,"creation_date":1570266142,"last_edit_date":1570266461,"question_id":58246840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58246840","body_markdown":"I could not understand how relational operator work in tuples.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; (0,1,2000000) &lt; (0,3,5)\r\n    True\r\n\r\nThe question I have is 2000000 when compared with 5 it should return False since 2000000 is not lesser than 5.

I thought that either GHC would assume that `t == m` in the `mapM` type and the output of `mapM` would become `m (m b)` which would be join-able or it would not and this would error out because of type mismatch. Instead the following happened:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmapM :: (Traversable t, Monad m) =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; t a -&gt; m (t b)\r\njoin :: Monad m =&gt; m (m a) -&gt; m a\r\njoin . mapM :: Traversable t =&gt; (a -&gt; t a -&gt; b) -&gt; t a -&gt; t b\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand how this is possible. The way I understand it, function composition should use the inputs of the first (or the second depending how you look at it) function and the outputs of the second function. But here the expected input function for `mapM` changes from a unary function to a binary function and I have no clue why. Even if GHC can&#39;t just make the assumption that `t == m` like I did, which I half expected, it should error out because of type mismatch, not change the input function type, right?
