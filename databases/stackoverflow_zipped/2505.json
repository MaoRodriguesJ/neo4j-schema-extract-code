I&#39;m particularly confused as in last week&#39;s assignment, I was able to successfully sort two arrays at the same time with the correct order -- however, this week, there are pointers involved, though I&#39;m fairly certain that shouldn&#39;t affect a sort referencing just the elements themselves.  \r\n\r\nSo far, I&#39;ve tried entering the following data in many different entry orders:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1000\r\n500\r\n560\r\n750\r\n1200\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe loading seems to be fine referencing the actual putting-data-in, and the sort appears to be sorting some numbers properly (putting 500 first, for instance, most of the time), but I&#39;m clearly doing something incorrectly for it to be failing to sort. I&#39;ll show some entries and outputs below.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the code for my selection sort itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid selectionSort(int rentArray[], int arrayElements)\r\n{\r\n\tint minSort = 0;\r\n\tint sortHold;\r\n\tsortHold;\r\n\r\n\tfor (int x = 0; x &lt; arrayElements - 1; x++)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tsortHold = rentArray[x];\t\t\t\r\n\t\tfor (int y = x + 1; y &lt; arrayElements; y++)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tif (rentArray[y] &lt; sortHold)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tminSort = y;\r\n\t\t\t\tsortHold = rentArray[y];\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif (minSort != x)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tsortHold = rentArray[x];\t\t\r\n\t\t\trentArray[x] = rentArray[minSort];\t\r\n\t\t\trentArray[minSort] = sortHold;\r\n\t\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\t\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNaturally, I expect the output to go from anything to sort the array into [500, 560, 750, 1000, 1200] rather than what it&#39;s going to.

Let me demonstrate the problem with an example.\r\n\r\nLets say we have this Widget:\r\n\r\n```\r\nContainer(\r\n  width: 25,\r\n  height: 10,\r\n  decoration: BoxDecoration(\r\n    color: const Color(0xff7c94b6),\r\n    border: Border.all(\r\n      color: Colors.black,\r\n      width: 8.0,\r\n      ),\r\n    ),\r\n  child: /* some custom widget */,\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow lets say I want to make the `Container` properties like `width`, `height` etc. changable by parameters. If a certain parameter for a property is not passed it should use its default value, like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CustomWidget extends StatelessWidget {\r\n  final double width;\r\n  final double height;\r\n  final BoxDecoration decoration;\r\n\r\n  const CustomWidget ({\r\n    Key key,\r\n    this.width = 25,\r\n    this.height = 10,\r\n    this.decoration = /* default decoration */\r\n    /* possibly even more properties */\r\n  }) : super(key: key);\r\n\r\n  @override\r\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n    return Container(\r\n      width: width,\r\n      height: height,\r\n      decoration: decoration,\r\n      child: /* some custom widget */\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nObviously, there could be more properties which would lead to more and more boilerplate. Also what do you do, if the container does not have a decoration by default? Should you pass a custom Container always? Also consider that the Container could be nested further down the widget tree.\r\n\r\nThere must be a good solution, I just can&#39;t think of one, probably because my thoughts are biased because of my experience with frontend development. In web project you simply pass the component/widget custom css-classes to overwrite the styles (e.g. a parameter `containerClasses`). How do you do it properly in flutter?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** In essence my question is: Is there an equivalent to a css-class in flutter? Or: Whats the best way to make a custom widget&#39;s style totally customizable by parameters. I feel like i have to write every single property by hand. \r\n\r\nIn react you have an interface for all html elements  (e.g. `div`, `input` etc.) and their props (e.g. for an `input`-element you have an interface with `value`, `class`, `type` etc.), which you can use to define what parameters one can pass to customize the component/widget.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939186/how-to-reuse-widget-styles-properly-in-flutter","title":"How to reuse widget styles properly in flutter?"},{"tags":["android","android-studio","debugging","android-ndk"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":186,"user_id":2756220,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc6a02809911d6af7b0db3e356728fda?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"HarryQ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2756220/harryq"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568496173,"creation_date":1568496173,"answer_id":57939350,"question_id":57939184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939350","body_markdown":"Updating to Platform-tools version 29.0.4 solves the problem.

It changes when you enter a new function. Using an alias like `self` was historically a way of avoiding this problem but in your case you&#39;re using arrow functions. An arrow function won&#39;t change the `this` value from the surrounding scope.\r\n\r\nNow let&#39;s look at why this doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nmounted () {\r\n    console.log(this.items); // Doesn&#39;t show the data\r\n    setTimeout(function() {\r\n        console.log(this.items); // Doesn&#39;t show the data too\r\n    }, 3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first time it tries to access `this.items` is too soon. The asynchronous `fetch` won&#39;t have completed yet.\r\n\r\nThe second time, inside the `setTimeout`, we&#39;ve got a new function, so the `this` value changes. Using an arrow function should show the correct data:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nsetTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(this.items);\r\n}, 3000);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAssuming, of course, that the data loads within 3 seconds.\r\n\r\nOf course a timer isn&#39;t the correct way to handle this.\r\n\r\nThe simplest option is to avoid creating the child components until the data is available:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;court-map v-if=&quot;courts.length&quot; :items=&quot;courts&quot;&gt;&lt;/court-map&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `v-if` will prevent the component being created until there are entries in the array. Doing it this way ensures the `created` and `mounted` hooks won&#39;t be run until the `courts` are ready to be passed as `items`.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an empty array isn&#39;t the best choice of initial value here as it&#39;s difficult to tell that apart from an empty array returned by the server. If instead we use a `null` value initially that gets a bit simpler.\r\n\r\n```js\r\ndata() {\r\n    return {\r\n        courts: null\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;court-map v-if=&quot;courts&quot; :items=&quot;courts&quot;&gt;&lt;/court-map&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOther code that uses `courts` may need adjusting accordingly.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you don&#39;t want to use `v-if` to delay the creation of the children then you could use `watch` within the child to wait for when `items` changes. You can then trigger any actions that needs to occur.\r\n\r\nA further note on why this line doesn&#39;t work:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlongitude: this.items[firstIndex].longitude\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the first problem is that `this.items` won&#39;t have loaded yet (as covered above). The second problem will be that `firstIndex` isn&#39;t defined. The `firstIndex: 0` a few lines above it is irrelevant. `this.items[firstIndex]` is trying to use a local variable called `firstIndex` and that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing more it&#39;s difficult to say but `position` might be better implemented as a computed property.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939174/how-to-get-vue-props-and-data-fetched-from-within-an-ajax-call-in-the-mounted/57939815#57939815","title":"How to get Vue props and data fetched from within an AJAX call in the mounted() and created() hooks"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7040859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3cf0930a201a7375cbd14b44a39c118?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Salva L&#243;pez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7040859/salva-l%c3%b3pez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7040859,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c3cf0930a201a7375cbd14b44a39c118?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Salva L&#243;pez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7040859/salva-l%c3%b3pez"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939815,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568534966,"creation_date":1568494335,"last_edit_date":1568534966,"question_id":57939174,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939174","body_markdown":"I&#39;m just trying to set data got it from an AJAX call using the built-in ```fetch()``` method into a data variable ```courts``` of my Vue component (I&#39;m using Vue2).  \r\n\r\nI know that when you are into the ```fetch()``` method, the context of keyword ```this``` can change.

I have 2 library modules inside a dummy app. `module1` imports `module2` which has extension functions.\r\n\r\nI applied Kotlin plugins into `module1` so the first lines of module&#39;s `build.gradle` look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\napply plugin: &#39;com.android.library&#39;\r\napply plugin: &#39;kotlin-android&#39;\r\napply plugin: &#39;kotlin-android-extensions&#39;\r\n```\r\nAfter that I got the following build error when trying to export the artifact to .jar:\r\n```\r\nError:Kotlin: Unsupported plugin option: org.jetbrains.kotlin.android:enabled=true\r\n```\r\nWhat&#39;s really weird is that when I remove one of the Kotlin plugins, e.g. `kotlin-android-extensions`, that error no longer occurs. Instead, no extension function from `module2` can be resolved (obviously.)\r\n```\r\nError:(x, y) Kotlin: Unresolved reference: extensionFunctionFromModule2\r\n```\r\nOther classes can be resolved and everything would work without extension functions.\r\n\r\n**Additional info**\r\n\r\nWhen I removed only `kotlin-android` plugin everything was being built successfully... for a very short time. The very next day I suddenly got errors about extension functions&#39; references again.\r\n\r\nAm I doing something wrong or is it a bug of IntelliJ IDEA/Kotlin/Gradle? Seeing that strange behavior (the fact that two Kotlin plugins cannot be applied at the same time) I assume it&#39;s some kind of bug. (Maybe caching?)

If, for instance, you display a jpg produced by a digital camera or cell-phone directly on a monitor screen, it will typically be displayed at 72dpi and you&#39;ll be able to see only a small portion of the image. At that resolution, the full-sized image would be huge--more than a meter wide and proportionally height. But if printed at, say, 300dpi, the whole image might fit nicely on an 8.5x11/A4 sheet of paper. \r\n\r\nSince the camera or program doesn&#39;t necessary know how the image will be displayed or printed, it doesn&#39;t necessarily include resolution information in the EXIF data. More accessible is the data on the absolute size of the image in pixels: x wide and y high. Given those dimensions, the &quot;dpi&quot; of the image entirely depends on the physical size (in imperial inches: dots-per-inch) of the image output to paper or screen.

The voltages have 20 bit resolution (assume it is only positive).\r\n\r\n```Verilog\r\nmodule capacitor(clk, rst, enable, sw, current, vcap, rst);\r\n\r\n    parameter cap_num=256;\r\n    parameter volt_width = 20;\r\n    input clk, enable, rst;\r\n    input signed [volt_width-1:0] current;\r\n    input [2*cap_num-1:0] sw; //corresponding to each capacitor is a switch. 01 implies positive, 11 implies negative, and 00 implies bypassed.\r\n    output reg [cap_num*volt_width-1:0] vcap;\r\n\r\n    integer i;\r\n\r\n    always @ (posedge clk)\r\n    for(i=0; i&lt;cap_num; i = i + 1)\r\n    begin\r\n        if(rst)\r\n            vcap[i] = 0;\r\n        else \r\n        if(enable)\r\n            begin\r\n            case(sw[2*(i+1)-1 -: 2)\r\n               2&#39;b00 : \r\n               vcap[volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width] &lt;= vcap[volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width];\r\n               2&#39;b01 : \r\n               vcap[volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width] &lt;= vcap [volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width] + current;\r\n               2&#39;b11 : \r\n               vcap[volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width]&lt;= vcap [volt_width*i-1 -: volt_width] - current;\r\n            endcase\r\nendmodule\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor 128 capacitors, the model worked properly on an FPGA.  However, 256 capacitors is causing timing issues.  I am thinking that there is too much to calculate at once.  Is there a way that I can pipeline this for better performance? I am not very well-versed in Verilog yet. The code may be a little bit wrong since it is not line-for-line the same as my old working code; I hope that readability is better this way.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939094/implementing-conditional-discrete-equations-in-verilog","title":"Implementing conditional discrete equations in Verilog"},{"tags":["python","pyarrow","apache-arrow"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":873,"user_id":1222694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6530ed3104afdf80a0eda91118ec35aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Josh W.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1222694/josh-w"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568510977,"post_id":57939649,"comment_id":102295983,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939092/fastest-way-to-construct-pyarrow-table-row-by-row/57939649#comment102295983_57939649"},{"owner":{"reputation":16056,"user_id":5189811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzPWr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Oluwafemi Sule","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5189811/oluwafemi-sule"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":873,"user_id":1222694,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6530ed3104afdf80a0eda91118ec35aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Josh W.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1222694/josh-w"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568546314,"post_id":57939649,"comment_id":102301260,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939092/fastest-way-to-construct-pyarrow-table-row-by-row/57939649#comment102301260_57939649"},{"owner":{"reputation":3437,"user_id":109525,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1TSBj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Arthur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/109525/arthur"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568625220,"post_id":57939649,"comment_id":102319471,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939092/fastest-way-to-construct-pyarrow-table-row-by-row/57939649#comment102319471_57939649"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16056,"user_id":5189811,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FzPWr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Oluwafemi Sule","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5189811/oluwafemi-sule"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568499121,"creation_date":1568499121,"answer_id":57939649,"question_id":57939092,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939649","body_markdown":"Since the schema is known ahead of time, you can make a list for each column and build a dictionary of _column name and column values_ pairs.\r\n\r\n```ipython\r\n%%timeit -r 10\r\nimport pyarrow as pa\r\nimport random\r\nimport string \r\nimport time\r\n\r\nlarge_dict = dict()\r\n\r\nfor i in range(int(1e6)):\r\n    large_dict[i] = (random.randint(0, 5), random.choice(string.ascii_letters))\r\n\r\n\r\nschema = pa.schema({\r\n        &quot;key&quot;  : pa.uint32(),\r\n        &quot;col1&quot; : pa.uint8(),\r\n        &quot;col2&quot; : pa.string()\r\n  })\r\n\r\nkeys = []\r\nval1 = []\r\nval2 = []\r\nfor k, (v1, v2) in large_dict.items():\r\n  keys.append(k)\r\n  val1.append(v1)\r\n  val2.append(v2)\r\n\r\ntable = pa.Table.from_pydict(\r\n    dict(\r\n        zip(schema.names, (keys, val1, val2))\r\n    ),\r\n    schema=schema\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; 2.92 s &#177; 236 ms per loop (mean &#177; std. dev. of 10 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939092/fastest-way-to-construct-pyarrow-table-row-by-row/57939649#57939649","title":"Fastest way to construct pyarrow table row by row"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":748,"user_id":1845302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8w8Ft.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dima Fomin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1845302/dima-fomin"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571421065,"creation_date":1571421065,"answer_id":58455866,"question_id":57939092,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455866","body_markdown":"I am playing with pyarrow as well. \r\nFor me it seems that in your code *data-preparing stage* (random, etc) is most time consuming part itself. \r\nSo may be first try to convert data into dict of arrays, and then feed them to Arrow Table.\r\n\r\nPlease look, I make example based on your data and ```%%timeit```-ing only Table population stage.

The tricky bit is that the key is &#39;1&#39;, but once we have that (`jsontext[1]`) we get the `state` key, and then the `on` key, which will return `&#39;true&#39;` or `&#39;false&#39;`, and you can use those strings in your later code\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939087/ajax-get-command-to-to-get-states-o-the-lights/57945263#57945263","title":"AJAX GET command to to get states o the lights"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12067501,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0de137f73916de4abaa275bca9b5366?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bruno Pereira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067501/bruno-pereira"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568824250,"creation_date":1568493387,"question_id":57939087,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939087","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to do a html application to run in a localhost tha allow to control phillips hue lights.

issue here is where do yo want to convert the **List** to **Set**,\r\nthe conversion can be done before **Class3** mapped to **Class4** and after that.\r\n\r\nSo the struggle here is if you want to make **Set&lt;Class3&gt;** from **List** and then convert it to **Set&lt;Class4&gt;** or first apply conversion from **Class3** to **Class4**. This is important because List can contain duplicated values, where the Set contains only of unique values. Making `List&lt;Class3&gt;` to `Set&lt;Class3&gt;` as first operation will depend on the equality of Class3 objects. Making `List&lt;Class4&gt;` to `Set&lt;Class4&gt;` will check the equality implemented for Class4.\r\n\r\nThe little mapper between objects is always required, if you don&#39;t want to explicitly declare mapping method use a copy constructor `Class4(Class3) {...}` for example.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example:\r\n```\r\nimport lombok.*;\r\nimport java.util.List;\r\nimport java.util.Set;\r\nimport java.util.function.Function;\r\nimport java.util.stream.Collectors;\r\n\r\npublic class MappingWithLambdas {\r\n    private static Function&lt;Class1,Class2&gt; c1To2WithMapping = c1 -&gt; {\r\n        Function&lt;Class3,Class4&gt; c3to4 = c3 -&gt; {\r\n            Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n            c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n            c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n            return c4;\r\n        };\r\n        Function&lt;List&lt;Class3&gt;, Set&lt;Class4&gt;&gt; listToSet = l -&gt; l.stream().map(c3to4).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n        Class2 c2 = new Class2();\r\n        c2.setX(c1.getX());\r\n        c2.setY(c1.getY());\r\n        c2.setDatas(listToSet.apply(c1.getDatas()));\r\n        return c2;\r\n    };\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Class1 c1 = new Class1();\r\n        c1.setX(&quot;X&quot;); c1.setY(&quot;Y&quot;);\r\n        c1.setDatas(List.of(new Class3(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), new Class3(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;), new Class3(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)));\r\n        System.out.println(c1);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Using mapping function: &quot;);\r\n        System.out.println(c1To2WithMapping.apply(c1));\r\n        Function&lt;Class1,Class2&gt; c1to2WithNew = Class2::new;\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Using Class2 constructor: &quot;);\r\n        System.out.println(c1to2WithNew.apply(c1));\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Simply with constructor: &quot;);\r\n        System.out.println(new Class2(c1));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n@Data\r\nclass Class1 {\r\n    private String x;\r\n    private String y;\r\n    private List&lt;Class3&gt; datas;\r\n}\r\n@Data\r\nclass Class2 {\r\n    private String x;\r\n    private String y;\r\n    private Set&lt;Class4&gt; datas;\r\n    private Function&lt;List&lt;Class3&gt;, Set&lt;Class4&gt;&gt; listToSetWithNew = l -&gt; l.stream().map(Class4::new).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n    Class2() {}\r\n    Class2(Class1 c) {\r\n        this.x = c.getX();\r\n        this.y = c.getY();\r\n        this.datas = listToSetWithNew.apply(c.getDatas());\r\n//List&lt;Class3&gt;-&gt;List&lt;Class4&gt;-&gt;Set&lt;Class4&gt;\r\n//        this.datas = c.getDatas().stream().map(Class4::new).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n//List&lt;Class3&gt;-&gt;Set&lt;Class3&gt;-&gt;Set&lt;Class4&gt;\r\n//        this.datas = new HashSet&lt;&gt;(c.getDatas()).stream().map(Class4::new).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n@Data\r\nclass Class3 {\r\n    private String x;\r\n    private String y;\r\n    Class3(String x, String y) {\r\n        this.x = x;\r\n        this.y = y;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n@Data\r\nclass Class4 {\r\n    private String x;\r\n    private String y;\r\n    Class4() {}\r\n    Class4(Class3 c) {\r\n        this.x = c.getX();\r\n        this.y = c.getY();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`@Data` annotation comes from Lombok library, which created the setters, getters and toString for me.\r\n\r\nAnd the output of this should look similar to this:\r\n```\r\nClass1(x=X, y=Y, datas=[Class3(x=x, y=y), Class3(x=x, y=y), Class3(x=x, y=y)])\r\nClass2(x=X, y=Y, datas=[Class4(x=x, y=y)])\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nYou still could to something like this:\r\n```\r\nClass2 c22 = List.of(c1).stream().map(i1 -&gt; {\r\n        Class2 i2 = new Class2();\r\n        i2.setX(i1.getX());\r\n        i2.setY(i1.getY());\r\n        i2.setDatas(i1.getDatas().stream().map(c3 -&gt; {\r\n            Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n            c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n            c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n            return c4;\r\n        }).collect(Collectors.toSet()));\r\n        return i2;\r\n}).collect(Collectors.toList()).get(0);\r\nSystem.out.println(c22);\r\n```\r\nBut creating List of a single object just to achieve such syntax costs in performance.\r\n\r\nEdit2:\r\n\r\nI flew away a bit, making the mapper between `Class1` and `Class2` and what you are looking for is probably something like that:\r\n```\r\nFunction&lt;List&lt;Class3&gt;, Set&lt;Class4&gt;&gt; convertClassesAndToSet = l -&gt; l.stream().map(c3 -&gt; {\r\n        Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n        c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n        c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n        return c4;\r\n    }).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\nFunction&lt;List&lt;Class3&gt;, Set&lt;Class4&gt;&gt; toSetAndConvertClasses = l -&gt; new HashSet&lt;&gt;(l).stream().map(c3 -&gt; {\r\n        Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n        c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n        c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n        return c4;\r\n}).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n```\r\nOr something more related to the variable names you&#39;ve used:\r\n```\r\nSet&lt;Class4&gt; list3ToList4ThenSet = list1.stream().map(c3 -&gt; {\r\n    Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n    c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n    c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n    return c4;\r\n}).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\nSet&lt;Class4&gt; list3ToSetThen4 = new HashSet&lt;Class3&gt;(list1).stream().map(c3 -&gt; {\r\n    Class4 c4 = new Class4();\r\n    c4.setX(c3.getX());\r\n    c4.setY(c3.getY());\r\n    return c4;\r\n}).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n```\r\nEdit3(or4...):\r\nSamples with the list of Class1 to Class2 objects\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Class2&gt; list2WithConstructor = list1.stream().map(Class2::new).collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n//change this.datas=... in Class2 constructor to:\r\nthis.datas = c.getDatas().stream().map(Class4::new).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n//or to (depending of your use case):\r\nthis.datas = new HashSet&lt;Class3&gt;(c.getDatas()).stream().map(Class4::new).collect(Collectors.toSet());\r\n//then you will feel the real constructor magic ;P\r\n```\r\nAnd a sample with mapper inside lambdas:\r\n```\r\nList&lt;Class2&gt;

It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.\r\n\r\n&gt;The `toString` method for class `Object` returns a string consisting of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign character &#39;`@`&#39;, and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the hash code of the object. In other words, this method returns a string equal to the value of:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     getClass().getName() + &#39;@&#39; + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())\r\n     \r\nThe reason you&#39;re seeing this output is due to the way `TableColumn` works. A `TableColumn` has both a [`cellValueFactory`][2]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The cell value factory needs to be set to specify how to populate all cells within a single TableColumn. A cell value factory is a Callback that provides a TableColumn.CellDataFeatures instance, and expects an ObservableValue to be returned. The returned ObservableValue instance will be observed internally to allow for immediate updates to the value to be reflected on screen. An example of how to set a cell value factory is:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     lastNameCol.setCellValueFactory(new Callback&lt;CellDataFeatures&lt;Person, String&gt;, ObservableValue&lt;String&gt;&gt;() {\r\n&gt;         public ObservableValue&lt;String&gt; call(CellDataFeatures&lt;Person, String&gt; p) {\r\n&gt;             // p.getValue() returns the Person instance for a particular TableView row\r\n&gt;             return p.getValue().lastNameProperty();\r\n&gt;         }   \r\n&gt;     });  \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;A common approach is to want to populate cells in a TableColumn using a single value from a Java bean. To support this common scenario, there is the PropertyValueFactory class. Refer to this class for more information on how to use it, but briefly here is how the above use case could be simplified using the PropertyValueFactory class:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     lastNameCol.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory&lt;Person,String&gt;(&quot;lastName&quot;));\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAnd a [`cellFactory`][3]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The cell factory for all cells in this column. The cell factory is responsible for rendering the data contained within each TableCell for a single table column.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;By default TableColumn uses the default cell factory, but this can be replaced with a custom implementation, for example to show data in a different way or to support editing.There is a lot of documentation on creating custom cell factories elsewhere (see Cell and TableView for example).\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Finally, there are a number of pre-built cell factories available in the javafx.scene.control.cell package.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the `cellValueFactory` determines _what_ value will be displayed and the `cellFactory` can customize _how_ said value will be displayed. If no custom `cellFactory` is set then it uses the [`DEFAULT_CELL_FACTORY`][4]:\r\n\r\n&gt;If no cellFactory is specified on a TableColumn instance, then this one will be used by default. At present it simply renders the TableCell item property within the `graphic` property if the `item` is a Node, or it simply calls `toString()` if it is not null, setting the resulting string inside the `text` property.\r\n\r\nIn your code, you currently have:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    @FXML\r\n    private TableColumn&lt;PlacesEntity, PeopleEntity&gt; vstcolName;\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    public void readJoin() \r\n        ...\r\n        vstcolName.setCellValueFactory(new PropertyValueFactory&lt;&gt;(&quot;peopleByPeopleId&quot;));\r\n        ...\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    ...\r\n\r\nWhat this does is configure the `vstcolName` column to extract a `PeopleEntity` (from an `PlacesEntity`) as the value for each `TableCell`. The problem here is you don&#39;t set a `cellFactory`, which means each `TableCell` is going to display `PeopleEntity#toString()` (and since you didn&#39;t override that method you get the default `Object#toString()` output). Based on the name of the column (i.e. &quot;Name&quot;) I&#39;m assuming you actually want the cells to display `PeopleEntity#getPplName()`. In order to do this, you need to set a `cellFactory` and return a custom `TableCell` that overrides [`updateItem(T,boolean)`][5]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The updateItem method should not be called by developers, but it is the best method for developers to override to allow for them to customise the visuals of the cell. To clarify, developers should never call this method in their code (they should leave it up to the UI control, such as the ListView control) to call this method. However, the purpose of having the updateItem method is so that developers, when specifying custom cell factories (again, like the ListView cell factory), the updateItem method can be overridden to allow for complete customisation of the cell.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;It is **very important** that subclasses of Cell override the updateItem method properly, as failure to do so will lead to issues such as blank cells or cells with unexpected content appearing within them. Here is an example of how to properly override the updateItem method:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;     protected void updateItem(T item, boolean empty) {\r\n&gt;         super.updateItem(item, empty);\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;         if (empty || item == null) {\r\n&gt;             setText(null);\r\n&gt;             setGraphic(null);\r\n&gt;         } else {\r\n&gt;             setText(item.toString());\r\n&gt;         }\r\n&gt;     }\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;\r\n&gt;Note in this code sample two important points:\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 1. We call the super.updateItem(T, boolean) method. If this is not done, the item and empty properties are not correctly set, and you are likely to end up with graphical issues.\r\n&gt; 2. We test for the empty condition, and if true, we set the text and graphic properties to null. If we do not do this, it is almost guaranteed that end users will see graphical artifacts in cells unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nIn your case, it might look something like:\r\n\r\n    vstcolName.setCellFactory(tv -&gt; new TableCell&lt;&gt;() {\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        protected void updateItem(PeopleEntity item, boolean empty) {\r\n            super.updateItem(item, empty);\r\n            if (empty || item == null) {\r\n                setText(null);\r\n            } else {\r\n                setText(item.getPplName());\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    });\r\n\r\n_**Note:** Configuring the `cellValueFactory` and `cellFactory` of a `TableColumn` should only happen once, during initialization. You currently set the `cellValueFactory` in a public method named `readJoin()` which seems like it might be called often. As you&#39;re using FXML, you should move the `TableColumn` configuration to the `@FXML private void initialize() { ... }` method of the controller._\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The original socket sockfd is unaffected by\r\n       this call.\r\n\r\nSo other connections are building up in a queue on the original socket, waiting for your application to respond to them by calling `accept()` on it again. (Bugs aside, there&#39;s no such thing as other connections that want to be bound to the state of the newly accepted socket since unlike a LISTENING socket, it is bound to the specific source address and port of the client that was accepted off the queue.)\r\n\r\nConsequently, you should design your application to get back to calling accept on the original LISTEN socket in a reasonable amount of time. Some people use threading, some people fork to have another process for handling each new socket, some people prevent large tasks either on any one socket in their protocol or at any iteration in a main loop that examines each ongoing task at each interval and does a set amount of work.\r\n\r\nIf you do nothing but accept new sockets as old ones are done then a number of clients will sit patiently waiting if they are trivial and will probably give up on their connections if they are less trivial implementations from existing protocols.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

If they were coming from outside the program, then a solution would be to programmatically verify them (eg against predefined list of values).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939011/should-non-variable-column-names-be-prepared-in-a-prepared-query/57939056#57939056","title":"Should non-variable column names be prepared in a prepared query?"}],"owner":{"reputation":103,"user_id":8610591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98a381e836cc3487e925b62d46834c8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sammy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8610591/sammy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":103,"user_id":8610591,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98a381e836cc3487e925b62d46834c8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sammy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8610591/sammy"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939056,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568493059,"creation_date":1568492582,"last_edit_date":1568492927,"question_id":57939011,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939011","body_markdown":"An example given for using prepared statements with the mysql package on npm looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM ??

This will allow you to control the response if an error occurs, gives you the ability to throw your own errors, and will also allow you to return your newly created Ticket model instead of the Request values — this is a better indication of success and will contain the new Model&#39;s `id`.\r\n \r\nhttps://laravel.com/docs/5.8/database#database-transactions\r\n\r\n**Eloquent relationships**\r\n\r\nThe next thing I would do is leverage Eloquent&#39;s ability to store relationships without needing to specify the parent Model&#39;s `id`.  I am assuming your relationship is defined as Ticket *HasOne* TicketHeader and the method is `ticketHeader()`, but you can update it as necessary.\r\n \r\nhttps://laravel.com/docs/5.8/eloquent-relationships#the-save-method\r\n\r\n\r\n**Controllers and methods**  \r\n\r\nEach Model (e.g., Ticket) should have its own Controller (e.g., TicketController).  Since you are storing a new model, your method should probably conform to the standard `store(Request $request)`.  The `create()` method in a Controller is generally used to return a View which displays a form.  Take a look at the Laravel scaffold within a Controller when created using the resource flag.\r\n\r\n`php artisan make:controller ModelController --resource` \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/matticustard/607ac1e0e36b22e14c7658c65b94915a\r\n\r\nhttps://laravel.com/docs/master/controllers#resource-controllers\r\n\r\n**Sample `store()` method**\r\n```php \r\npublic function store(Request $request)\r\n{\r\n    $request-&gt;validate([\r\n        &#39;TicketTitle&#39; =&gt; &#39;required|max:150&#39;,\r\n        &#39;TicketDescription&#39; =&gt; &#39;required&#39;,\r\n    ]);\r\n\r\n    // begin the transaction\r\n    DB::beginTransaction();\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n\r\n        // store a new ticket\r\n        $ticket = Ticket::create();\r\n\r\n        // store the TicketHeader using the relationship to Ticket\r\n        $ticket-&gt;ticketHeader()-&gt;save(new TicketHeader([\r\n            &#39;TicketTitle&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;TicketTitle,\r\n            &#39;TicketDescription&#39; =&gt; $request-&gt;TicketDescription,\r\n        ]));\r\n\r\n    } catch (\\Exception $exception) {\r\n\r\n        // roll back database changes on error\r\n        DB::rollBack();\r\n\r\n        // log the error\r\n        report($exception);\r\n\r\n        // return a custom error response\r\n        return response()-&gt;json($exception-&gt;getMessage(), 500);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // commit the database changes (end the transaction)\r\n    DB::commit();\r\n\r\n    // return the ticket instead of the request — better indication of success\r\n    return response()-&gt;json($ticket, 201);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI hope this helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939004/how-to-create-db-entries-in-a-model-with-foreign-keys-best-practice/57939353#57939353","title":"How to create DB entries in a model with foreign keys -

You, simply put, cannot execute `.java` files, they have to be compiled in `.class` files. This is because Java is compiled to Bytecode (the machine language for the Java Virtual Machine), which is executed by the JVM. Both Javascript and Python can be executed without being compiled (there is Javascript/Python interpreter which runs the `.js` or `.py` files directly). There are some intermediate files in Python, with the `pyc` extension, which are alike the `.class` files, but, again, they are not good for protecting your code.\r\n\r\nNow, if you want somebody to be able to execute your code without being able to read it, you have to keep in mind two things:\r\n\r\n   1. Decompilers/deobfuscators and so exist and are very good at their job;\r\n   2. While, in Java, the JVM executes compiled code, Python&#39;s and Javascript&#39;s interpreters execute the code as you write it;\r\n\r\nYou can try to obfuscate the code, but anybody will be able to deobfuscate it with the right tool. Does this mean that you Python code is less protected than your Java code? No, you can decompile `.class` and `.jar` files to read the source code (in fact, it is automatically done in IntelliJ Idea every time you navigate to the implementation of a library class or method).\r\n\r\nSo, if you want people to use your software but don&#39;t want them to copy it, you have two ways:\r\n    \r\n   1. Do not distribute the software and go the SaaS way;\r\n   2.

There are no errors or messages.\r\n\r\nHere are the two pieces of code: page1.php\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    if(isset($_COOKIE[&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;])){$impressionId=$_COOKIE[&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;];}\r\n    else{$impressionId=&quot;Imp&quot;.substr(microtime(),11,11).substr(microtime(),1,7);\r\n    setcookie(&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;, $impressionId, 0, &quot;/&quot;);}\r\n    session_name(&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;);\r\n    session_id($impressionId);\r\n    session_start();\r\n    $_SESSION[&quot;Test&quot;] = &quot;Hello&quot;;\r\n    if(isset($_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;])){\r\n        $_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;] = $_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;]+1;\r\n    }\r\n    else{\r\n        $_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;] = 1;\r\n    }\r\n    echo &quot;PAGE 1&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_save_path = &quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    if (is_writable(session_save_path())) {\r\n        echo &quot;Session path &#39;&quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&#39; is writable for PHP!&lt;br&gt;&quot;; \r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        echo &quot;Session path &#39;&quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&#39; is not writable for PHP!&lt;br&gt;&quot;; \r\n    }\r\n    echo &quot;session_name = &quot;.session_name().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_id = &quot;.session_id().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_status = &quot;.session_status().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_Test = &quot;.$_SESSION[&quot;Test&quot;].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_Number = &quot;.$_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nand page2.php\r\n```\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n    session_name(&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;);\r\n    session_id($_COOKIE[&quot;gcpp_imp&quot;]);\r\n    session_start();\r\n    echo &quot;PAGE 2&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_save_path = &quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    if (is_writable(session_save_path())) {\r\n        echo &quot;Session path &#39;&quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&#39; is writable for PHP!&lt;br&gt;&quot;; \r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n        echo &quot;Session path &#39;&quot;.session_save_path().&quot;&#39; is not writable for PHP!&lt;br&gt;&quot;; \r\n    }\r\n    echo &quot;session_name = &quot;.session_name().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_id = &quot;.session_id().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_status = &quot;.session_status().&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_Test = &quot;.$_SESSION[&quot;Test&quot;].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    echo &quot;session_Number = &quot;.$_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;].&quot;&lt;br&gt;&quot;;\r\n    ?&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput from page1.php\r\n\r\n    PAGE 1\r\n    session_save_path = /var/cpanel/php/sessions/ea-php56\r\n    Session path &#39;/var/cpanel/php/sessions/ea-php56&#39; is writable for PHP!\r\n    session_name = gcpp_imp\r\n    session_id = Imp1568485583.309708\r\n    session_status = 2\r\n    session_Test = Hello\r\n    session_Number = 1\r\n\r\nOutput from page2.php\r\n\r\n    PAGE 2\r\n    session_save_path = /var/cpanel/php/sessions/ea-php56\r\n    Session path &#39;/var/cpanel/php/sessions/ea-php56&#39; is writable for PHP!\r\n    session_name = gcpp_imp\r\n    session_id = Imp1568485583.309708\r\n    session_status = 2\r\n    session_Test =\r\n    session_Number =\r\n\r\nThe pages are both run from https, with no subdomain, from the same folder.  My server is a VPS shared hosting at Hostiso, running PHP Version 5.6.40.\r\n\r\nphpinfo.php shows session.gc_divisor = 0, session.gc_maxlifetime = 2880 (I will want to increase this) and session.gc_probability = 0.\r\n\r\nWhen I refresh page1.php the output stays the same.  So the cookie gcpp_imp is being set once and once only, the key/session_id $impressionId is being generated once and once only, and I can see the cookie and value in my browser.  But $_SESSION[&quot;Number&quot;] is not being updated in page1.php and neither session variable is being displayed in page2.php.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938971/php-session-variables-not-updating-even-on-same-page","title":"PHP Session Variables not updating even on same page"},{"tags":["javascript","json","reactjs","api","react-hooks"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":34067,"user_id":1377002,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oDeF7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1377002/andy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568492801,"creation_date":1568492801,"answer_id":57939031,"question_id":57938970,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939031","body_markdown":"Initially `data` is an empty object.
