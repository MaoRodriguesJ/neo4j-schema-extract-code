This is what it looks like:\r\n\r\n&gt;PS C:\\Users\\*myname*\\Documents\\Java\\java_with_vscode&gt; &amp; &#39;C:\\Users\\*myname*\\.vscode\\extensions\\vscjava.vscode-java-debug-0.21.0\\scripts\\launcher.bat&#39; &#39;C:\\Program Files\\AdoptOpenJDK\\jdk-11.0.4.11-hotspot\\bin\\java&#39; &#39;-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8&#39; &#39;-cp&#39; &#39;C:\\Users\\*myname*\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\workspaceStorage\\0e6931a1b8b4239719709a0414b75a46\\redhat.java\\jdt_ws\\java_with_vscode_e672b01a\\bin&#39; &#39;Hello&#39;\r\ntest\r\nPS C:\\Users\\*myname*\\Documents\\Java\\java_with_vscode&gt; \r\n\r\nSo the code chows up after the huge blob of text, and it also works with user input as I tested before but I know for a fact this isn&#39;t how it is supposed to be displayed. I watched Youtube videos and for everyone, their code shows up in debug console, and for me my debug console is empty. The output tab is also empty, and when im either selected on output or debug console, it just automatically runs the code in the terminal. I am unsure why this happens, and searching for hours online didn&#39;t help, either this a problem unique to me or I&#39;m being braindead and missing a really simple step. Either case, I would appreciate some help. How do I make it so that my code shows up in debug console how it is supposed to rather than in the terminal?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time.\r\n\r\nI have redownloaded Visual Studio from Ninite and

have to classes, `A` and `B`. There are actually many other classes that all share a pointer to `A`, because `A` is sort of a manager that controls all the other classes during runtime.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `A` and `B` both open a bunch of file I/Os during their lifetime, but any class can request the execution to stop. At this point, I&#39;d like to gracefully close all the files which are open. `B` and all other classes all contain a member function like\r\n````\r\nvoid B::CloseFile()\r\n````\r\nSo my idea was that I first instantiate `A` which contains an empty vector of `CloseFile` function pointers, then instantiate all the subsequent classes that &quot;register&quot; their own `Close` functions in `A`&#39;s vector. Then any class can call a stop, and call `A`&#39;s (since all classes have a pointer to `A`) `CloseAll` function, which traverses the vector and closes everything its got.\r\n\r\nI tried to prototype this in a simple example and I&#39;m getting stuck.

Here is the relevant code:\r\n\r\nThe page:\r\n\r\n    // pages/index.js\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    const Page = ({ user }) =&gt; {\r\n      return &lt;MyPage user={user} /&gt;;\r\n    };\r\n\r\n\r\n    Page.getInitialProps = async (context) =&gt; {\r\n      const { apolloClient } = context;\r\n      const user = await apolloClient.query({ query: GetUser }).then(({ data: { user } }) =&gt; user);\r\n      \r\n      return { user };\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    export default Page;\r\n\r\nAnd the component:\r\n\r\n    // components/MyPage.jsx\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    export default ({ user }) =&gt; {\r\n      const [toggleActive] = useMutation(ToggleActive, {\r\n        variables: { id: user.id },\r\n        update: proxy =&gt; {\r\n          const currentData = proxy.readQuery({ query: GetUser });\r\n          \r\n          if (!currentData || !currentData.user) {\r\n            return;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          console.log(&#39;user active in update:&#39;, currentData.user.isActive);\r\n          \r\n          proxy.writeQuery({\r\n            query: GetUser,\r\n            data: {\r\n              ...currentData,\r\n              user: {\r\n                ...currentData.user,\r\n                isActive: !currentData.user.isActive\r\n              }\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n      \r\n      console.log(&#39;user active status:&#39;, user.isActive);\r\n      \r\n      return &lt;button onClick={toggleActive}&gt;Toggle active&lt;/button&gt;;\r\n    };\r\n\r\nWhen I continuously press the button, the console log in the update function shows the user active status as flipping back and forth, so it seems that the apollo cache is getting updated properly. However, the console log in the component always shows the same status value.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t see this problem happening with any other apollo cache updates that I&#39;m doing where the data object that the component uses is acquired in the component using the `useQuery` hook (i.e. not from a query in `getInitialProps`).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036337/next-apollo-how-to-correctly-update-apollo-cache-if-the-relevant-query-was-run","title":"Next/Apollo: How to correctly update

Since you know the value of `removeAt` for each document, you can run a periodic check, and remove or hide the documents that have expired while your snapshot listener was active.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036315/firestore-onremove-not-called-when-document-meets-condition/58037918#58037918","title":"Firestore onRemove not called when document meets condition"}],"owner":{"reputation":405,"user_id":7675202,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e99802f1d5c001149e8a3da58a7bace?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mohamed Mohamed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7675202/mohamed-mohamed"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58037918,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569048171,"creation_date":1569024929,"last_edit_date":1569048171,"question_id":58036315,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036315","body_markdown":"I have an expire condition, like snapchat, when the expire time is met then to remove the document from the query, but it doesn&#39;t work until the app is reloaded or closed the open, not in realtime.\r\n\r\nCode:\r\n\r\n    Services().crud.readStream(\r\n        stream: this\r\n            .collection\r\n            .where(&#39;user&#39;, isEqualTo: APIs().users.collection.document(cUserID))\r\n            .where(&#39;removeAt&#39;, isGreaterThan: Timestamp.now())\r\n            .snapshots(),\r\n        onEmpty: () {\r\n          onEmpty(null);\r\n        },\r\n        onAdded: (p) {\r\n          onAdded(Post().model(id: p.documentID, map: p.data));\r\n          return null;\r\n        },\r\n        onModified: (p) {\r\n          onModified(Post().model(id: p.documentID, map: p.data));\r\n          return null;\r\n        },\r\n        onRemoved: (p) {\r\n          onRemoved(Post().model(id: p.documentID, map: p.data));\r\n          return null;\r\n        },\r\n        onFailure: (e) {\r\n          onFailure(e);\r\n          return null;\r\n        });\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing is that it works, just not in realtime.

(I enabled AWS_IAM Authorization)\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Joey Kilpatrick requested, here is my updated (still ineffectual) Resource Policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    &quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;,\r\n    &quot;Statement&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;,\r\n            &quot;Principal&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;AWS&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:iam::&lt;AccountID&gt;:user/Service_Account&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            &quot;Action&quot;: &quot;execute-api:Invoke&quot;,\r\n            &quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:execute-api:us-west-2:&lt;AccountID&gt;:&lt;API&gt;/*/*&quot;,\r\n            &quot;Condition&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;IpAddress&quot;: {\r\n                    &quot;aws:SourceIp&quot;: &quot;0.0.0.0/1&quot;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, i&#39;m hitting the API with a 147.x.x.x IP so I would expect this API to return a 403. I have also tested with the previously stated &quot;CurrentTime&quot; Condition.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036296/why-does-the-condition-element-in-aws-api-gateway-resource-policy-not-trigger","title":"Why does the Condition Element in AWS API

And also how to correctly construct the `assert_select &#39;form[action=&quot;/users/???/edit&quot;]&#39;` assertion?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036282/how-can-i-get-the-user-id-of-a-test-user-created-by-a-test-fixture-file-and-how","title":"How can I get the user ID of a test user created by a test fixture file?

float -&gt; float`, and you&#39;re writing `f c`, it must mean that `f : (float -&gt; float -&gt; float) -&gt; &#39;x` (for some `&#39;x` that we don&#39;t know yet).\r\n\r\nSince you also write `f a`, and we already know that `f`&#39;s argument is `float -&gt;

It&#39;s a function, not a number. This is what the compiler is telling you.\r\n\r\nUsually, when you get yourself in a situation where you don&#39;t understand what your type are doing, go ahead and add some type annotations. They will provide anchors for the compiler, sort of walls that the type inference cannot cross, and thus will contain the type inconsistencies.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you specify the type of `f`:\r\n\r\n    let dichotomy (f : float -&gt; float) a b =\r\n       ...\r\n\r\nthis immediately reveals an error at `f c`, stating that `c` was expected to be a `float`, but actually is a function.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly, what you meant to do is to apply `f` to `(c a b)`, not to `c` itself. And then, correspondingly, return that same value in the tuples `(a, c)` and `(c, b)`:\r\n\r\n    out (mywhile (fun (a, b) -&gt; a - b &lt; eps)\r\n        (fun (a, b) -&gt; \r\n          let d = c a b\r\n          if f d * f a &lt; 0. then (a, d) else (d, b)\r\n        )\r\n        (a, b))\r\n\r\n(also, your zero was an `int`; I made it into a `float` by adding a dot after it)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036279/f-expecting-a-type-supporting-the-operator-but-given-a-function-type/58036648#58036648","title":"F#.

Something in our build setup must have changed and we can&#39;t figure out what is going on. I have tried to re-clone the repo from last week prior to the break but still no dice. I have re-installed Unity and Android SDK and even tried it on a different box and nothing works. It seems to be a Java related issue as it is complaining about missing a java class, but I am at a loss as to how to have the builder find the missing class, as I have not touched any of the Java stuff. \r\n\r\nI kind of remember windows doing an update around the time everything stopped working.

It never did that before. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n-Louis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036269/unity3d-android-build-that-crashes-on-execution-with-ref-to-android-support-v4-c","title":"Unity3d Android build that crashes on execution with ref to android.support.v4.content.fileprovider?"},{"tags":["mongodb"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569024561,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474263_58036266"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12092623,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ed7dd571247ecd97b2763c279a799ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsociety00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092623/fsociety00"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569025546,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474367,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474367_58036266"},{"owner":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569025777,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474394,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474394_58036266"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12092623,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ed7dd571247ecd97b2763c279a799ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsociety00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092623/fsociety00"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569026040,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474426,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474426_58036266"},{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12092623,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ed7dd571247ecd97b2763c279a799ae?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"fsociety00","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12092623/fsociety00"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569026107,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474437,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474437_58036266"},{"owner":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569026394,"post_id":58036266,"comment_id":102474465,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036266/i-could-not-establish-mongodb#comment102474465_58036266"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":149919,"user_id":1902010,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a19f9308334d07d4be19c8f6d11151ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ceejayoz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1902010/ceejayoz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569026439,"creation_date":1569026439,"answer_id":58036424,"question_id":58036266,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036424","body_markdown":"Per [the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/):\r\n\r\n&gt;

Any connections exceeding a default latency are deemed to be unavailable. See the pic shown below, the only possible connection to that Azure virtual machine is via the **Internet**. Any internet traffic which trying to enter the virtual network must pass through the **load balancer**, and this balancer **is filtering ICMP traffic**, allow **UDP** and **TCP** traffic.\r\n\r\n&gt; By default, Azure denies and blocks all public inbound traffic to an\r\n&gt; Azure virtual machine,   includes ICMP traffic. This is a good thing\r\n&gt; because it can improve security by reducing the attack surface.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n**Note:** This restrict only apply to the network traffic which going through the external IP through configured endpoints. But if the network traffic occurred between internal IPs of VMs which in the same virtual network or in the same cloud service, ICMP would be allowed. \r\n\r\nThis restrict does not limited permanently. We can set **firefall** or **[azure security group][3]** to allow this. But, unfortunately, for Azure Devops Pipeline, the hosted agent is using the VM `DS2_V2` and `DS3_V2`, which are all could not be configured\\modified with firefall and security group by external users. If build\\release with **private agent**, ICMP will not be limit. You can set a **private agent**, and execute ping test in it. \r\n\r\n*(Sometimes, can use **VPN** or **ExpressRoute** to skip the load balancer filter and limit. But I don&#39;t recommend to use this way)*\r\n \r\n----\r\n\r\nSince Ping is a very convenient and critical tool for troubleshooting connectivity, we are reviewing and considering to expand this feature in Azure VM. There has a such suggestion ticket raised in our uservoice forum: [Enable ICMP traffic to Azure VMs over the Internet][4]. You can vote for it as well to push it faster into the development queue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/microsoft_azure_guide/2014/12/13/how-to-allow-ping-functionality-to-windows-azure-machines/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/y8sgQ.png\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/security-overview?WT.mc_id=thomasmaurer-blog-thmaure\r\n  [4]: https://feedback.azure.com/forums/217313-networking/suggestions/6423260-enable-icmp-traffic-to-azure-vms-over-the-internet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036207/is-there-a-way-to-open-icmp-on-an-azure-pipeline-vm/58091261#58091261","title":"is there a way to open ICMP on an Azure Pipeline vm?"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":1226994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":27,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iqs2B.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AKornich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1226994/akornich"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58091261,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569387497,"creation_date":1569023509,"question_id":58036207,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036207","body_markdown":"is there a way to open ICMP on an Azure Pipeline vm? my CI unit tests are expected to send ping requests to the google DNS (8.8.8.8)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036207/is-there-a-way-to-open-icmp-on-an-azure-pipeline-vm","title":"is there a way to open ICMP on an Azure Pipeline vm?"},{"tags":["pandas","merge","conditional-statements"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1850,"user_id":9375102,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/nk7Vi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Datanovice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9375102/datanovice"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569028115,"post_id":58036206,"comment_id":102474708,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036206/shifting-rows-of-data-when-merging-dataframes#comment102474708_58036206"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12016989,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1a89f3a7e06564d98dbf6926653a07e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"johnbreeden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12016989/johnbreeden"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12016989,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1a89f3a7e06564d98dbf6926653a07e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"johnbreeden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12016989/johnbreeden"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569023879,"creation_date":1569023438,"last_edit_date":1569023879,"question_id":58036206,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036206","body_markdown":"I&#39;m attempting to merge two dataframes of financial data.

I understand how to merge dataframes and shift columns, but adding the condition that the row to merge on is where the value in tic column is the same, report_adj column is 1, and the value in the date column in is the first value higher than the value in the date column for fundamental data is beyond my current knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn the example below, the data from f1 should be merged in row 1 because the date in d1 is the first value higher than the date in f1 AND there is a 1 in the report_adj column AND the tic column are the same.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/ywfI4.jpg\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/267Yq.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036206/shifting-rows-of-data-when-merging-dataframes","title":"Shifting rows of data when merging dataframes"},{"tags":["proxy","ip","screen-scraping","testcafe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":9994312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2LIza.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Kamaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9994312/alex-kamaev"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569243676,"post_id":58036203,"comment_id":102522432,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036203/testcafe-get-current-ip-of-proxy-being-used#comment102522432_58036203"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9092563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IUBgRGI8W0I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAG1Q/KSn7hpYJAPg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9092563/rom"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3104,"user_id":9994312,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2LIza.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alex Kamaev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9994312/alex-kamaev"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569439429,"post_id":58036203,"comment_id":102601446,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036203/testcafe-get-current-ip-of-proxy-being-used#comment102601446_58036203"},{"owner":{"reputation":2044,"user_id":5114901,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c785197ac4ffd8fc2ff395ee3a748e98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrey Belym","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5114901/andrey-belym"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569588086,"post_id":58036203,"comment_id":102656283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036203/testcafe-get-current-ip-of-proxy-being-used#comment102656283_58036203"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":9092563,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IUBgRGI8W0I/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAG1Q/KSn7hpYJAPg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9092563/rom"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569023420,"creation_date":1569023420,"question_id":58036203,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036203","body_markdown":"I would like to know if anyone has a way to get the IP address of the currently used proxy IP of a running TestCafe test.

I should have known that, but, well, I had to see it to make sense.\r\n\r\nUsing `procmon.exe`, did not shed any light and the various calls to the registry was like reading a foreign language, not helpful.\r\n\r\nHere I drew a blank until it occurred to me to get the source code for `AfxOleRegisterTypeLib`, as that what was failing. I wanted to see what the heck that thing did and what was at line 113 of source file `ctlreg.cpp`.\r\n\r\nI was still thinking on the comment of `procmon` and a registry issue, but I figured that the code will tell me which one. It took me a bit of research, but I found the [code][3]. I love Microsoft sharing code. Their error messages are not helpful, but being able to actually see what they were trying to do so totally helps.\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n    BOOL AFXAPI AfxOleRegisterTypeLib(HINSTANCE hInstance, REFGUID tlid,\r\n    \tLPCTSTR pszFileName, LPCTSTR pszHelpDir)\r\n    {\r\n    \tUSES_CONVERSION;\r\n    \r\n    \tBOOL bSuccess = FALSE;\r\n    \tCString strPathName;\r\n    \tTCHAR *szPathName = strPathName.GetBuffer(_MAX_PATH);\r\n    \t::GetModuleFileName(hInstance, szPathName, _MAX_PATH);\r\n    \tstrPathName.ReleaseBuffer();\r\n    \tLPTYPELIB ptlib = NULL;\r\n    \r\n    \t// If a filename was specified, replace final component of path with it.\r\n    \tif (pszFileName != NULL)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tint iBackslash = strPathName.ReverseFind(&#39;\\\\&#39;);\r\n    \t\tif (iBackslash != -1)\r\n    \t\t\tstrPathName = strPathName.Left(iBackslash+1);\r\n    \t\tstrPathName += pszFileName;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tif (SUCCEEDED(LoadTypeLib(T2COLE(strPathName), &amp;ptlib)))\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tASSERT_POINTER(ptlib, ITypeLib);\r\n    \r\n    \t\tLPTLIBATTR pAttr;\r\n    \t\tGUID tlidActual = GUID_NULL;\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (SUCCEEDED(ptlib-&gt;GetLibAttr(&amp;pAttr)))\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tASSERT_POINTER(pAttr, TLIBATTR);\r\n    \t\t\ttlidActual = pAttr-&gt;guid;\r\n    \t\t\tptlib-&gt;ReleaseTLibAttr(pAttr);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t// Check that the guid of the loaded type library matches\r\n    \t\t// the tlid parameter.\r\n    \t\tASSERT(IsEqualGUID(tlid, tlidActual));\r\n    \r\n    \t\tif (IsEqualGUID(tlid, tlidActual))\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\t// Register the type library.\r\n    \t\t\tif (SUCCEEDED(RegisterTypeLib(ptlib, T2OLE((LPTSTR)(LPCTSTR)strPathName), T2OLE((LPTSTR)pszHelpDir))))\r\n    \t\t\t\tbSuccess = TRUE;\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\tRELEASE(ptlib);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \telse\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tTRACE1(&quot;Warning: Could not load type library from %s\\n&quot;, (LPCTSTR)strPathName);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \treturn bSuccess;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI kept receiving an `ASSERT`, so although line 113 did was on a non-code line, the actual failure was obvious. I knew that I did not fail out on the `ASSERT_POINTER`, as that error message is different, which meant that I failed at:\r\n\r\n    \t\tASSERT(IsEqualGUID(tlid, tlidActual));\r\n\r\nI looked at the code in detail as well as the entry arguments. I decided to copy and paste this function contents into the real registration code in my OCX to gain further visibility while debugging. I wanted to see the values.\r\n\r\nSure enough, I saw 2 different `GUID` values, one from the top, my `_tlid`, and the one returned from the instance handle. I took out my handy-dandy `TextPad` text editor, though `Visual Studio` has a `Find in Files`, but TextPad is so much easier to use. That led to one other instance in the entire solution, namely in `DriveOps.idl`. That file up until that moment meant nothing to me, but suddenly I saw that the `GUID` here was the one that `RegSvr32.exe` pulled from the instance handle.\r\n\r\nI unified the IDs, rebuilt, and now `RegSvr32.exe` no longer complains. Yeah, since I got the code, it had no choice but to register. That it does not modify the registry is a different story and problem from what I can tell, but that is another question. `RegSvr32.exe` now registers without complaint.\r\n\r\n(Yes, I still have `tlbimp.exe`, `aximp.exe`, and adding my OCX project to my `WinForms` project problems, but I got this thing licked and learned something in the process. I guess the difference in line numbers may be some changes Microsoft made in the header, either way, functionality appears the same.)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/microsoft/VCSamples/tree/master/VC2008Samples/MFC/controls/regsvr\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/microsoft/VCSamples\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/Rupan/winscp/blob/master/libs/mfc/source/ctlreg.cpp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036192/ocx-afxoleregistertypelib-fails-with-error-0x80040200/58459000#58459000","title":"OCX AfxOleRegisterTypeLib fails with error 0x80040200"}],"owner":{"reputation":7353,"user_id":2769729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uw4wO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sarah Weinberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2769729/sarah-weinberger"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7353,"user_id":2769729,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uw4wO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sarah Weinberger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2769729/sarah-weinberger"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58459000,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571438804,"creation_date":1569023234,"last_edit_date":1569518758,"question_id":58036192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036192","body_markdown":"I upgraded an OCX library from VS2010/Win7 to VS2019/Win10.

Here is some more information on the non-Windows DLLs\r\n\r\n - PlxApi720_x64.dll:    PLX v7.2 API (The Broadcom PLX chip is a PCIe switch (think USB/network switch, just w/PCIe lanes)\r\n - LSIDirectAccess.dll:  The LSI API is a self-contained DLL that allows the software to talk to the LSI HBA RAID adapter\r\n - Ipp*.dll: The `Ipp` prefix are the DLLs used by the Intel Code Composer Studio redistribution (x64) files, here version 2011, an older one that needs to be updated to the latest and greatest, not to mention now free API. These are all in the `System32` folder.\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n    // DllRegisterServer - Adds entries to the system registry\r\n    STDAPI DllRegisterServer(void)\r\n    {\r\n    \tAFX_MANAGE_STATE(_afxModuleAddrThis);\r\n    \r\n    \tif (!AfxOleRegisterTypeLib(AfxGetInstanceHandle(), _tlid))\r\n    \t\treturn ResultFromScode(SELFREG_E_TYPELIB);           // &lt;- failure line, through debugging\r\n    \r\n    \tif (!COleObjectFactoryEx::UpdateRegistryAll(TRUE))\r\n    \t\treturn ResultFromScode(SELFREG_E_CLASS);\r\n    \r\n    \treturn NOERROR;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `Intel Code Composer Studio 2011` files are in the `C:\\Windows\\System32` directory, just like on the Win7 box.\r\n\r\nFor what it is worth, `TlbExp` fails on the Win7 box too, just it registers, which is probably why the UI can add the control. As I recall, I once replaced the OCX on the Win7 project and VS2010 automatically created the TLB and prefixed Ax in front, but that was a couple of years ago, so my memory may not be the most accurate. Attempting to add the OCX to the UI (.Net WinForms) fails miserably and just says could not be added.\r\n\r\nThe OCX does use the latest platform tool set (`Visual Studio 2019 (v142)`).\r\n\r\n[![OCX property page][5]][5]\r\n\r\nA comment for developer newbies, `regasm.exe` is for .Net Assemblies. `RegSvr32.exe` is for `ActiveX Controls (OCX/DLL)`, which is what I have. RegSvr32 is for dynamically loaded modules, hence the DllRegister entry point.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nNotes From Further Testing\r\n\r\n1. (Saturday 9/21/2019) When I upgraded, I created an empty C++ DLL project and then added all the files, changing the target extension to OCX going through the old project settings and when reasonable aligning them to the new project file wanting to keep things the same. I wanted to do a test and see what happens with a brand new OCX project. I saw that there was such a thing as &quot;MFC ActiveX Control&quot; for a project type in VS2019. I created that and saw that I got different base files, but more importantly RegSvr32.exe works. That means that either the mistake was the initial project file, so I need to import to a clean project or import piece by piece, if that is possible, and see where things break.\r\n\r\n2. (Saturday 9/21/2019) The new test project did not come with a manifest file and `TlbExp.exe` failed with the same error message like my real project. I went to add new item and saw &quot;Package Manifest&quot;. That manifest file, though still produces the same TlbExp.exe error, looks quite different from the application manifest file from above. I created yet another new `MFC ActiveX Control` project and added in the manifest from above just changing names and saw that the project refused to build throwing 1) Error\tc1010001 Values of attribute &quot;level&quot; not equal in different manifest snippets. and 2) LNK1327\tfailure during running mt.exe. That tells me that the original Win7 project and my Win10 project files probably have some error in it, otherwise VS should have thrown these errors to me. That does not answer why even on the test project `TlbExp.exe` fails. Maybe some attributes in the manifest are required. I just left the defaults.\r\n\r\nPackage Manifest\r\n(It is the first time that I ever saw one of these.

This [article][6] has an interesting approach, namely create a C++ DLL and then call `LoadLibrary(dll)` and after that `GetProcAddress(module, &quot;DllRegisterServer&quot;)` to see which one fails. Well, in my case the both functions succeed. That means that the author missed one other failure branch and these two API calls are not the only thing that `RegSvr32.exe` does.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/gRxhm.png\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45877162/cannot-register-my-ocx-with-error-code-0x80040200\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/o49Lu.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOGi8.png\r\n  [5]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1Qwyb.png\r\n  [6]: https://cdivilly.wordpress.com/2008/03/14/debugging-com-dll-registration-problems/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036192/ocx-afxoleregistertypelib-fails-with-error-0x80040200","title":"OCX AfxOleRegisterTypeLib fails with error 0x80040200"},{"tags":["macos","keychain","appstoreconnect","p8"],"owner":{"reputation":5349,"user_id":198301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b85858c8092862d570cf864a2c1d2a03?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ericg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/198301/ericg"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569023205,"creation_date":1569023205,"question_id":58036189,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036189","body_markdown":"After I generate an App Store Connect API key and download it, I would like to be able to keep this p8 key in the macOS Keychain to keep it secure.\r\n \r\nHow can I do that?\r\n \r\nIt does not appear that the Keychain Access application can import these keys directly.\r\n \r\nIf this is not recommended, what is the standard practice for keeping these keys secure?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036189/how-can-i-store-my-p8-key-in-the-keychain","title":"How can I store my p8 key in the keychain?"},{"tags":["android","ios","sqlite","iot","offline"],"owner":{"reputation":810,"user_id":1008933,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/090330b177e40c4aeba3d4653c2e62da?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Axil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1008933/axil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569023202,"creation_date":1569023202,"question_id":58036188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036188","body_markdown":"I have a realtime / iot use case for mobile that I would like to architect/model for offline database with synchronization mechanism.\r\n\r\nI would like to know some thoughts on how to architect and model this.

The program was compiled with the following command:\r\n\r\n    g++ file.cpp -std=c++11 -lpthread -o file\r\n\r\nI am pretty sure this is an issue related to pointers and proper dereferencing syntax, however, after many attempts and altering the syntax, some form of the error persists. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036186/printing-array-values-passed-thru-a-struct-via-pthread-create-in-c","title":"Printing Array Values Passed Thru a Struct Via Pthread_Create in C++"},{"tags":["c++"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":737,"user_id":12014856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e4290d1d269bdf7cbc8a4c42da43ade?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Enthus3d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12014856/enthus3d"},"last_editor":{"reputation":737,"user_id":12014856,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e4290d1d269bdf7cbc8a4c42da43ade?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Enthus3d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12014856/enthus3d"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569025668,"last_edit_date":1569025668,"creation_date":1569024208,"answer_id":58036258,"question_id":58036185,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036258","body_markdown":"The short answer to your question is that, yes, for your current program, it is necessary.\r\n\r\nThe RF() function in this case is the function called when we initialize the RF object, eg. \r\n\r\n`RF new_RF;`\r\n\r\nWould run the RF() function and set things up. For this reason, it is called a &#39;constructor&#39;, because it helps you &#39;construct&#39; your class.\r\n\r\nIn your case, the constructor is necessary for your program because it sets up your Registers variable, so that the code below from your `OutputRF()` function can run.\r\n```\r\nfor (int j = 0; j&lt;32; j++)\r\n{        \r\n    rfout &lt;&lt; Registers[j]&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s also useful because we can use it to set up many things, for example, if our RF() constructor looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRF(int a)\r\n{ \r\n   Registers.resize(a);  \r\n   Registers[0] = bitset&lt;a&gt; (0);  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would instead resize the RF Registers to int a.

(also, this is a very simplified example of what I&#39;m trying to do)\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    labels: [&#39;1&#39;, &#39;2&#39;, &#39;&#39;,&#39;&#39;, ,, &#39;7&#39;],\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fasyX.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036178/chartjs-dont-show-all-x-axis-data-points-but-show-all-in-tooltips","title":"chartjs - don&#39;t show all x-axis data points, but show all in tooltips"},{"tags":["custom-wordpress-pages"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":926,"user_id":3343753,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aY4qS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pedro Rodrigues","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3343753/pedro-rodrigues"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569028506,"post_id":58036176,"comment_id":102474743,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036176/wordpress-comment-form-cookies-consent-how-to-checkbox-selected#comment102474743_58036176"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12001622,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qx5ihWt0nh8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/yrFy9x30cjs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sBucholtz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12001622/sbucholtz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29,"user_id":12001622,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qx5ihWt0nh8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABI/yrFy9x30cjs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"sBucholtz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12001622/sbucholtz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569025254,"last_edit_date":1569025254,"creation_date":1569024926,"answer_id":58036314,"question_id":58036176,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036314","body_markdown":"Its not ```checked =&quot;checked&quot;``` its just ```checked``` as an attribute.

Enums are defined using the `@enum` macro:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\n@enum State STOP START ERROR\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates three constants, `STOP`, `START`, and `ERROR`, all of type `State`. This means you can dispatch functions on the type of an enum:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\nimport Base.println\r\nfunction println(s::State)\r\n    if s == STOP\r\n        println(&quot;Stop state.&quot;)\r\n    elseif s == START\r\n        println(&quot;Start state.&quot;)\r\n    else\r\n        println(&quot;Error state.&quot;)\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; s = STOP\r\n\r\njulia&gt; println(s)\r\nStop state.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnums can be converted to integer values:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; Int.([STOP, START, ERROR])\r\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\r\n 0\r\n 1\r\n 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the default integer values for the sequence of enum states starts at `0`. However, you can choose to explicitly set the integer values for the enums when you use the `@enum` macro:\r\n\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; @enum Heat LOW=1 MEDIUM=2 HIGH=3\r\n\r\njulia&gt; Int.([LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH])\r\n3-element Array{Int64,1}:\r\n 1\r\n 2\r\n 3\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNote that when creating a switch, like in the `println` definition above, you can be confident that `STOP`, `START`, and `ERROR` are the only possible values of a `State` object.

(I have taken classes in high school about web development but complex html, css is still a little beyond my abilities at this present time and I do not know exactly what does what)\r\n\r\nI hope someone here as an idea, I found many solutions on here before so I decided to post my question here.\r\nThis is my first post on here and I hope I did it right.\r\n\r\nCSS:\r\n```css\r\nbody {\r\n  margin: 0 auto;\r\n}\r\n#select {\r\n  color: #ffffff;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.container {\r\n  width: 80%;\r\n  margin: auto;\r\n  overflow: hidden;\r\n  color: #ffffff;\r\n}\r\n#boxes {\r\n  margin: 20px;\r\n}\r\n#boxes .box {\r\n  float: left;\r\n  display: block;\r\n  border-style: solid;\r\n  border-color: #7f7f7f;\r\n  border-width: 5px;\r\n  margin: 5px;\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n  width: 27%;\r\n  padding: 10px;\r\n\r\n  transition: 0.5s;\r\n  -webkit-transition: 0.5s;\r\n  -moz-transition: 0.5s;\r\n  -o-transition: 0.5s;\r\n}\r\n#boxes .box:hover {\r\n  width: 30%;\r\n}\r\n#boxes .box img {\r\n  /*display: inline-block;*/\r\n  width: 100%;\r\n}\r\n#boxes .box h3 {\r\n  margin-top: 0;\r\n}\r\n#boxes .box a, a:active, a:visited, a:hover, a:link {\r\n  color: inherit;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHTML:\r\n```html\r\n&lt;section id=&quot;boxes&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;Box1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Box1&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;Lobby&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;Box2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Box2&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;Missile Wars&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;Box3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Box3&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;Creative&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Box4&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;Sky Block&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Box5&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;BedrockSMP&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n        &lt;a&gt;\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;Box6&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;h3&gt;TNT Wars&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/section&gt;\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036167/how-to-fix-div-shift-from-surrounding-div-that-have-width-change-from-mouse-hove","title":"How to fix div shift from surrounding div that have width change from mouse hover?"},{"tags":["javascript","python","datetime","momentjs"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1025,"user_id":5091805,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e4vgq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5091805/ari"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569024479,"creation_date":1569024479,"answer_id":58036276,"question_id":58036166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58036276","body_markdown":"To get the offset, I used the client side to figure that out so long as it&#39;s set correctly in their browser:\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.timeZoneOffset = new Date().getTimezoneOffset() / 60;\r\n\r\n// -10 (Australia)\r\n```\r\nI then factored that in to my function to either subtract or add 10 hours.\r\n\r\n*Note: If it&#39;s negative, it means it actually need to be positive, so in my case I would +10 hours to the UTC timestamp.

Then, you got unsafe code in runtime.\r\n\r\nThis is one safe way (prefer lists over arrays):\r\n```\r\nclass Deck &lt;T extends Card&gt; {\r\n    private List&lt;T&gt; cards;\r\n\r\n    public Deck () {\r\n        cards = new ArrayList()&lt;&gt;;\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n}\r\n\r\nNow, to answer your question you should go back to some basics first in java:\r\n\r\n1- Arrays are co-variant constructs\r\n\r\n2- Generics are invariant constructs\r\n\r\n3- Element Type is reified in arrays (reification)\r\n\r\n4- Parameter Type is erased in Generic (Type erasure)\r\n\r\nNo worries, let put aside scary concepts, and check what happened with your example:\r\n\r\n- The Formal type T is erased in Runtime.\r\n\r\n- It means it&#39;s completely removed in the bytecode.\r\n\r\n- In 1st example the T is just replaced with Object, because it&#39;s the nearest class to it (in terms of inheritance)\r\nso,\r\n```\r\ncards = (T []) new Object[52]\r\n```\r\nis translated to \r\n```\r\ncards = (Object []) new Object[52];\r\n```\r\nwhich is safe.\r\n\r\n- In 2nd example the T is bounded to Card and it becomes , hence,  the nearest class to it (in terms of inheritance)\r\nso, \r\n```\r\ncards = (T []) new Object[52]\r\n```\r\nis translated to\r\n```\r\ncards = (Card []) new Object[52];\r\n```\r\nSince Object is not a subtype of Card, you got a Runtime cast exception.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036163/why-java-lang-classcastexception-ljava-lang-object-cannot-be-cast-to-error/58040474#58040474","title":"Why &quot;java.lang.ClassCastException: [Ljava.lang.Object; cannot be cast to&quot; error for Bounded type parameters and not for Formal Type parameters?"}],"owner":{"reputation":69,"user_id":4220132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9ac08445819ba7f03d3566921054f636?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"abb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4220132/abb"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58040474,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569070347,"creation_date":1569022933,"question_id":58036163,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036163","body_markdown":"Since java does not have a generic array, I am using the regular trick of casting Object array to a type parameter.

At the end of the day, it&#39;s an `O(len(a) * len(b))` operation, so you&#39;ll need to create a 2D array of size `len(a) * len(b)` to vectorize.\r\n\r\nBroadcasting is achieved by inserting another axis into `b` so that it is a column vector:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b\r\narray([0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9])\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; b[:, np.newaxis]\r\narray([[0],\r\n       [1],\r\n       [3],\r\n       [4],\r\n       [7],\r\n       [8],\r\n       [9]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nso that now, a comparison will return a 2D array:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; a == b[:, np.newaxis] + n\r\narray([[False, False, False,  True, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False,  True, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False, False, False,  True, False, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False, False, False, False,  True, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False],\r\n       [False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False, False]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe indices `i, j` where there is a `True` value mean that `b[i] == a[j]`. Since we only care about the indices of `a` that match any value in `b`, we just look for *any* true value along the columns:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (a == b[:, np.newaxis] + n).any(axis=0)\r\narray([False, False, False,  True,  True, False,  True,  True, False, False])\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, all that is needed is to get the indices corresponding to the `True` values here:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; np.where((a == b[:, np.newaxis] + n).any(axis=0))\r\n(array([3, 4, 6, 7]),)\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYour example input has sorted arrays, which means you can actually do a linear operation in `O(len(a) + len(b))`, but you won&#39;t be able to vectorize it in general. Basically you could have an index into each array, increment one at a time in `b` and keep incrementing in `a` until you hit the next value. Of course this would be less efficient in general with numpy arrays than my above solution for &#39;typical&#39; (i.e. not massive) arrays.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036154/get-indices-of-numpy-array-where-values-are-offset-from-themselves-by-some-amoun/58036268#58036268","title":"Get indices of numpy array where values are offset from themselves by some amount"}],"owner":{"reputation":342,"user_id":1811073,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17347e7edbad326a47aea734d98ff45d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aweeeezy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1811073/aweeeezy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":342,"user_id":1811073,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/17347e7edbad326a47aea734d98ff45d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aweeeezy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1811073/aweeeezy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58036268,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569025463,"creation_date":1569022809,"last_edit_date":1569023781,"question_id":58036154,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036154","body_markdown":"If I have two arrays:\r\n```\r\na = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\r\nb = np.array([0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9])\r\nn = 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I, without the use of loops, find the indices of `a` which have a value equal to the values of `b` offset by some number `n`?\r\n\r\nI would think something like this would work but I get a `elementwise == comparison failed` warning and an empty array as a result:\r\n```\r\nnp.where(a == b + n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a for loop that accomplishes what I&#39;m trying to do:\r\n```\r\nfor val in b:\r\n    print(np.where(a == val + n))\r\n```\r\nIt outputs:\r\n```\r\n(array([3]),)\r\n(array([4]),)\r\n(array([6]),)\r\n(array([7]),)\r\n(array([], dtype=int64),)\r\n(array([], dtype=int64),)\r\n(array([], dtype=int64),)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036154/get-indices-of-numpy-array-where-values-are-offset-from-themselves-by-some-amoun","title":"Get indices of numpy array where values are offset from themselves by some amount"},{"tags":["android","android-room","moshi"],"owner":{"reputation":56,"user_id":6027806,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b38067cbcc8dc7f224286ed9ee7c32fd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Brandon Lim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6027806/brandon-lim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569022808,"creation_date":1569022808,"question_id":58036153,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036153","body_markdown":"Given that I&#39;m already using **Moshi** to convert the **Retrofit** response from JSON String to Objects, can I also configure the **Room Database** on Android to use **Moshi** for TypeConverter instead of manually typing up the TypeConverter functions and referencing **Moshi**? \r\n\r\nExample of some code that I have been writing that I think seems redundant. \r\n\r\n```\r\n@TypeConverter\r\n    fun fromJsonToPictures(value: String): List&lt;PictureObject&gt;? {\r\n\r\n        val moshi = Moshi.Builder().build()\r\n        val type = Types.newParameterizedType(List::class.java, PictureObject::class.java)\r\n        val adapter = moshi.adapter&lt;List&lt;PictureObject&gt;&gt;(type)\r\n        return adapter.fromJson(value)\r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58036153/configure-moshi-for-room-typeconverter","title":"Configure Moshi for Room TypeConverter"},{"tags":["javascript","android","ios","browser","webview"],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":3279205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/58234af7336d2ed42e22a01459761f02?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"SmartPatience","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3279205/smartpatience"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569022796,"creation_date":1569022796,"question_id":58036152,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58036152","body_markdown":"I am making a website which users will be accessing through social platforms (Instagram , Snapchat, FB etc.) on both iOS and Android.\r\n\r\nInstead of the website opening in the Webview (which all these apps have), I want to force opening the website in OS Default Browser.\r\n\r\nThere are several limitations of webview that my website won&#39;t be able to function without. \r\n\r\nNote: I don&#39;t have any control over iOS/Android Apps.
