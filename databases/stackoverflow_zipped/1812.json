When you query for a time range longer than your raw retention interval and whisper returns aggregated data.  The aggregation method used here is defined in your carbon aggregation configuration.\r\n\r\n2. When Grafana sends a query to Graphite it passes `maxDataPoints=&lt;width of graph in pixels&gt;`, and Graphite will perform aggregation to return at most that many points (because you don&#39;t have enough pixels to render more points than that).  The method used for this consolidation is controlled by the `consolidateBy` function.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for both of these to be used in the same query if you eg have a panel that queries 3 days worth of data and you store 2 days at 1-minute and 7 days at 5-minute intervals in whisper then you&#39;d have 72 * 60 / 5 = 864 points from the 5-minute archive in whisper, but if your graph is only 500px wide then at runtime that would be consolidated down to 10-minute intervals and return 432 points.\r\n\r\nSo, if you want to always have access to the count then you can change your carbon configuration to use `sum` aggregation for those series (and remove the existing whisper files so new ones are created with the new aggregation config), and pass `consolidateBy(&#39;sum&#39;)` in your queries, and you&#39;ll always get the sum back for each interval.\r\n\r\nThat said, you can also address this at query time by multiplying the average back out to get a total (assuming that your whisper aggregation config is using `average`).  The simplest way to do that will be to `summarize` the data with `average` into buckets that match the longest aggregation interval you&#39;ll be querying, then `scale` those values by that interval to calculate the total number of minutes.  Finally, you&#39;ll want to use `consolidateBy(&#39;sum&#39;)` so that any runtime consolidation will work properly.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconsolidateBy(scale(summarize(my.series, &#39;10min&#39;, &#39;avg&#39;), 60), &#39;sum&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith all of that said, you may want to consider reporting uptime in terms of percentages rather than raw minutes, in which case you can use the raw averages directly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110692/how-to-do-a-distinct-count-of-a-metric-using-graphite-datasource-in-grafana/58118235#58118235","title":"How to do a distinct count of a metric using graphite datasource in grafana?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":5934270,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b9d9b2b18433011f17aa3fcc6c68229a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Munagala","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5934270/munagala"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569505482,"creation_date":1569479059,"question_id":58110692,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110692","body_markdown":"I have a metric that shows the state of a server.

You can also use `count  = length`\r\n\r\nYou can fix this issue by defining it like this:\r\n\r\n    countInRange v1 v2 xs  = sum (map (length.filter (rangeHelper v1 v2)) xs)\r\n    -- or\r\n    countInRange v1 v2     = sum.map (length.filter (rangeHelper v1 v2))\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110682/count-the-number-of-values-in-a-nested-list-that-are-greater-and-less-than-certa/58112197#58112197","title":"Count the number of values in a nested list that are greater and less than certain values"}],"owner":{"reputation":53,"user_id":10972627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6d00af50aff1717041d56488c6445e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Larry.Fish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10972627/larry-fish"},"last_editor":{"reputation":50315,"user_id":849891,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eYKQi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Will Ness","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/849891/will-ness"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":111,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58112197,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569488244,"creation_date":1569479006,"last_edit_date":1569485904,"question_id":58110682,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110682","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a function for a homework problem that counts the number of values in a list for which the values are greater than `v1` and less than `v2`.

On many/most systems it is 8 bits, but the size is system dependent and it may also be larger.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nNew answer.\r\n\r\nThank you for the clarification, I believe that what you need is something like this:\r\n\r\n````\r\nint32_t before = 1093821061; // Int you want to transmit\r\n\r\nuint8_t buf[4];\r\nbuf[0] = static_cast&lt;uint8_t&gt;((before &gt;&gt; 0) &amp; 0xff);\r\nbuf[1] = static_cast&lt;uint8_t&gt;((before &gt;&gt; 8) &amp; 0xff);\r\nbuf[2] = static_cast&lt;uint8_t&gt;((before &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 0xff);\r\nbuf[3] = static_cast&lt;uint8_t&gt;((before &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff);\r\n\r\n// Add buf to your UDP packet and send it\r\n// Stuff...\r\n// After receiving the packet on the other end:\r\n\r\nint32_t after = 0;\r\nafter += buf[0] &lt;&lt; 0;\r\nafter += buf[1] &lt;&lt; 8;\r\nafter += buf[2] &lt;&lt; 16;\r\nafter += buf[3] &lt;&lt; 24;\r\n\r\nstd::cout &lt;&lt; before &lt;&lt; &quot;, &quot; &lt;&lt; after &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n````\r\n\r\nYour problem (as I see it), is that you want to store 32bit numbers in the 8bit buffers that you need for UDP packets. The way to do this is to pick the larger number apart, and convert it into individual bytes, transmit those bytes, and then assemble the big number again from the bytes.\r\n\r\nThe above code should allow you to do this. Note that I have changed types to `int32_t` and `uint8_t` to ensure that I know the exact size of my types - depending on the library you use, you may have to use plain `int` and `char` types, just be aware that then the exact sizes of your types are not guaranteed (most likely it will still be 32 and 8 bits, but they _can_ change in size if you change compiler or compile for a different target system). If you want you can add some `sizeof` checks to ensure that your types conform to what you expect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110637/fill-fixed-size-char-array-with-integers-in-c/58111096#58111096","title":"Fill fixed size char array with integers in C++"}],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":6572161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xDo8x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deniz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6572161/deniz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":73,"user_id":6572161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xDo8x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Deniz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6572161/deniz"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":69,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58111094,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569483850,"creation_date":1569478752,"last_edit_date":1569479587,"question_id":58110637,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110637","body_markdown":"I want to store integers in char array ex: 0 up to 1449, I checked other posts and I tried memset, sprinf etc. but either I get gibberish characters or unreadable symbols when I print inside of char array.

I was wanting to write within text files where each text file that is created, would increase in increments of 0.1 for a value say weight going from 0.1 to 1 (lbs) and also have length increase by a factor of 20 from 0 to 80 (inch). But the length will only increase by 20 until 1 lbs has been reached for the previous length. \r\n\r\nTo further explain, my code that I wrote below will create a txt file. But it will not perform what I would like it to do. I would like it to perform what I&#39;m about to say in the next sentence. Within the first txt file, the file will be weight_0.1_length_0_.txt and in the file would be  \r\n\r\n      &quot;weight of box 0.1&quot;\r\n      &quot;length of box 0&quot;\r\n\r\nThe next txt file would be weight_0.2_length_0_.txt and inside would be \r\n\r\n      &quot;weight of box 0.2&quot;\r\n      &quot;length of box 0&quot;\r\n\r\nand so on, But once the weight reaches 1, I would like the length to increase to 20. So the beginning txt file for the value 20 would weight_0.1_length_20_.txt and within the txt file would be \r\n\r\n      &quot;weight of box 0.1&quot;\r\n      &quot;length of box 20&quot;\r\n\r\nand this process would be followed until you reach a length of 80. I would have in turn a total of 50 txt files. \r\n\r\nbelow is the code I wrote but only increase the weight of the box by 0.1.

Why is that?\r\n\r\n        private void Page_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            TitleBarHelper.SetDarkTitleBar();\r\n            Window.Current.SetTitleBar(AppTitleBar);\r\n            UpdateTitleBarLayout(Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication.GetCurrentView().TitleBar);\r\n\r\n            FullMediaControl.Update();\r\n            SetMusic(MediaHelper.CurrentMusic);\r\n            FullPlaylistControl.ScrollToMusic(MediaHelper.CurrentMusic);\r\n\r\n            if (MusicInfoRequestedWhenUnloaded)\r\n            {\r\n                MusicPropertyBladeItem.StartBringIntoView();\r\n                MusicInfoRequestedWhenUnloaded = false;\r\n            }\r\n            else if (LyricsRequestedWhenUnloaded)\r\n            {\r\n                LyricsBladeItem.StartBringIntoView();\r\n                LyricsRequestedWhenUnloaded = false;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nSource Page Code is [here](https://github.com/SeakyLuo/SMPlayer/blob/master/SMPlayer/NowPlayingFullPage.xaml.cs). This page can be navigated using the &quot;Show Lyrics&quot; or &quot;Music Info&quot; item in the `MenuFlyout` at the right bottom more button.\r\n\r\nAnd actually the `FullPlaylistControl.ScrollToMusic` in the code above is also not working. It just scrolls to a row in a `ListView`. I guess they might be the same reason.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110480/uwp-startbringintoview-not-working-in-page-loaded","title":"UWP StartBringIntoView not working in Page_Loaded"},{"tags":["aws-lambda","amazon-cloudformation","aws-codebuild"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1307,"user_id":6485881,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OyjsG.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maurice","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6485881/maurice"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569480647,"post_id":58110477,"comment_id":102612014,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket#comment102612014_58110477"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":418549,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e05e4e456ba5978c5dae06eace99db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Schreck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418549/tom-schreck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569501777,"post_id":58112870,"comment_id":102623140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket/58112870#comment102623140_58112870"},{"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":418549,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e05e4e456ba5978c5dae06eace99db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Schreck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418549/tom-schreck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569503084,"post_id":58112870,"comment_id":102623858,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket/58112870#comment102623858_58112870"},{"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":418549,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e05e4e456ba5978c5dae06eace99db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Schreck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418549/tom-schreck"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569588237,"post_id":58112870,"comment_id":102656351,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket/58112870#comment102656351_58112870"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":749,"user_id":12072431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Svf7M.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shariqmaws","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072431/shariqmaws"},"last_editor":{"reputation":749,"user_id":12072431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Svf7M.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"shariqmaws","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12072431/shariqmaws"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569508229,"last_edit_date":1569508229,"creation_date":1569487408,"answer_id":58112870,"question_id":58110477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112870","body_markdown":"Unfortunately, unless you change the &quot;S3Key&quot; on &#39;AWS::Lambda::Function&#39; resource on every update, CloudFormation will not see it as a change (it will not look inside the zipped code for changes).\r\n\r\n**Options**:\r\n\r\nOption 1) Update S3 Key with every upload\r\n\r\nOption 2) Recommended advice is to use AWS SAM to author Lambda template, then use &quot;cloudformation package&quot; command to package the template, which takes cares of creating a unique key for S3 and uploading the file to the bucket.

The basic idea to deploy a Lambda function will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Create a a SAM template of your Lambda function\r\n\r\n2) A basic SAM template looks like:\r\n\r\n        AWSTemplateFormatVersion: &#39;2010-09-09&#39;\r\n        Transform: &#39;AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31&#39;\r\n        Resources:\r\n        FunctionName:\r\n            Type: &#39;AWS::Serverless::Function&#39;\r\n            Properties:\r\n                Handler: index.handler\r\n                Runtime: nodejs6.10\r\n                CodeUri: ./code\r\n\r\n3) Add a directory &quot;code&quot; and keep the lambda code files in this directory\r\n\r\n4) Install SAM Cli [1]\r\n\r\n5) Run the command to package and upload: \r\n    \r\n\r\n    $ sam package --template-file template.yaml --output-template packaged.yaml --s3-bucket {your_S3_bucket}\r\n\r\n\r\n6) Deploy the package:\r\n\r\n    $ aws cloudformation deploy --template-file packaged.yaml --stack-name stk1 --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM\r\n\r\nYou can keep the Template Code (Step1-2) in CodeCommit/Github and do the Steps4-5 in a CodeBuild Step. For Step6, I recommend to do it via a CloudFormation action in CodePipeline that is fed the &quot;packaged.yaml&quot; file as input artifact.\r\n\r\nSee also [2].\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n[1] Installing the AWS SAM CLI on Linux - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install-linux.html\r\n\r\n[2] Building a Continuous Delivery Pipeline for a Lambda Application with AWS CodePipeline  - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/lambda/latest/dg/build-pipeline.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket/58112870#58112870","title":"AWS CloudFormation update Lambda Code to use latest version in S3 bucket"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1304,"user_id":6464013,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85231023d5713a4219ac8e4623bbc7bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"amittn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464013/amittn"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569487609,"creation_date":1569487609,"answer_id":58112934,"question_id":58110477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112934","body_markdown":" - I am using `aws scp` instead of `aws cp` and never had this problem.\r\n - I am working on a project with serverless architecture with multiple lambdas, where in we have multiple folder with just a python file and requirement.txt file inside it.\r\n - Usually the directory and lambda is named the same for convenience for eg. folder `email_sender` would have python file as `email_sender.py` and a `requirement.txt` if it needs one.\r\n - In the code build after installing the dependencies i am just showing below how we are ziping \r\n\r\n```\r\n      echo &quot;--- Compiling lambda zip: ${d}.zip&quot;\r\n      d=$(tr &quot;_&quot; &quot;-&quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;${d}&quot;)\r\n      zip -q -r ${d}.zip . --exclude &quot;.gitignore&quot; --exclude &quot;requirements.txt&quot; --exclude &quot;*__pycache__/*&quot; &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1\r\n      mv ${d}.zip ../../${CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION}/${d}.zip\r\n\r\n```\r\n - And while doing a copy to s3 bucket we use scp as following \r\n```\r\naws s3 sync ${CODEBUILD_SOURCE_VERSION}/ ${S3_URI} --exclude &quot;*&quot; --include &quot;*.zip&quot; --sse aws:kms --sse-kms-key-id ${KMS_KEY_ALIAS} --content-type &quot;binary/octet-stream&quot; --exact-timestamps\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110477/aws-cloudformation-update-lambda-code-to-use-latest-version-in-s3-bucket/58112934#58112934","title":"AWS CloudFormation update Lambda Code to use latest version in S3 bucket"}],"owner":{"reputation":1966,"user_id":418549,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/84e05e4e456ba5978c5dae06eace99db?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tom Schreck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/418549/tom-schreck"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":92,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58112870,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569508229,"creation_date":1569477877,"question_id":58110477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110477","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to create a CloudFormation template supporting Lambda Function and AWS CodeBuild project for building .netcore source code into a deployed zip file in S3 bucket. \r\n Here are the particulars:\r\n\r\n - Using a GitHub mono-repo with multiple Lambda functions as different projects in the .netcore solution\r\n - Each Lambda function (aka .netcore project) has a CloudFormation YAML file generating a stack containing the Lambda function itself and CodeBuild project.\r\n - CodeBuild project is initiated from GitHub web hook which retrieves the code from GitHub sub-project and uses its buildspec.yaml to govern how build should happen.\r\n - buildspec uses .netcore for building project, then zips and copies output to a target S3 bucket\r\n - Lambda function points to S3 bucket for source code\r\n \r\nThis is all working just fine.

The point is that I need to move the object up and down (hold and drag), and at the same time I need to move the other object up and down (hold and drag) independently. Something like this:\r\n[Example][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/UbcNN.jpg\r\n\r\nAfter searching the Internet, I found a small script, but it only works for one touch at a time, and dragging only one object. Plus, if I touch with second finger the object changes his position to second finger position: \r\n\r\n```[RequireComponent(typeof(BoxCollider2D))]\r\n\r\npublic class Move : MonoBehaviour {\r\n    private Vector3 offset; \r\n\r\n  void OnMouseDown() {\r\n      offset = gameObject.transform.position - Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(new Vector3(-2.527f, Input.mousePosition.y));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  void OnMouseDrag() {    \r\n      Vector3 curScreenPoint = new Vector3(-2.527f, Input.mousePosition.y);\r\n      Vector3 curPosition = Camera.main.ScreenToWorldPoint(curScreenPoint) + offset;\r\n      transform.position = curPosition;    \r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI just can’t understand how I can make two objects drag and drop at the same time.
