Then used **KnockOut.js** to render it into the Web Resource.\r\n\r\nIn other instance we are developing a plugin which waits for some state on a Lead, validates information and if all is Ok invokes a Web Service to create the account in some other application.

been trying to automate Golden Software&#39;s Grapher (version 15) using C#. The program&#39;s guide for C++ (the file looks old, however, and I am not sure if it applies in a similar way now) notes that the user should:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. Create a new AppWizard dialog-based application, using all the standard options.\r\n&gt; 2. Edit the main dialog resource to contain the desired UI.  In this example, a Run and Close button.\r\n&gt; 3. Use Class Wizard to add a handler for the &quot;Run&quot; button.\r\n&gt; 4. Start Class Wizard, choose Add Class..., From a Type Library...\r\n&gt; 5. Grapher&#39;s type library is contained within the grapher.tlb file, so select    this file.  Rename the classes, in order, Document, Worksheet, Application, Documents.    Add all classes.\r\n\r\nTo me, this meant that I tried to use ([after some other reading][1]) the ```tlbimp``` command in developer prompt which I used to translate the &quot;grapher.tlb&quot; file into &quot;GrapherTypeLib.dll&quot;. I further used ```regasm``` to register this file (as [some places][2] seemed to suggest this is necessary). \r\n\r\nI added the reference to GrapherTypeLib.dll to my C# project along with making it not embed and to have a local copy.\r\n\r\nHowever, with my code:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Data;\r\n    \r\n    using GrapherTypeLib;\r\n    \r\n    public class Grapher15\r\n        {\r\n            public Grapher15(Functions _function, string _data, DataTable _summary, IProgress&lt;int&gt; progress)\r\n            {\r\n                try\r\n                {\r\n                    CreateProfiles(_data);\r\n                }\r\n                catch (Exception ex)\r\n                {\r\n                    throw ex;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            private void CreateProfiles(string _data)\r\n            {\r\n                // Create an instance which can work in the background\r\n                IAppObject _instance = new ApplicationClass();\r\n                _instance.Visible = true;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nI always crash out trying to create the application. I should note that I have tried different options here, including ```new Application()```, which result in the same thing:\r\n\r\n&gt; System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException: &#39;Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID {41F3A3D2-EAF3-42F0-9F62-A6E55F08F7E7} failed due to the following error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)).&#39;\r\n\r\nBased on my above checks and regasm, I would have thought that everything is registered properly. I should note that when this first started, I also re-installed the program to make sure all of the registrations were done properly. However, I then decided to check regedit and that doesn&#39;t actually seem to have the one CLSID this is looking for:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\nI started investigating and using ildasm, I found out that this GUID matches what should be the registry value for ```GrapherTypeLib.ApplicationClass``` which does not seem to be registered in the regid listing. At the same time, ildasm notes, for example, a different value to ```GrapherTypeLib.Application``` than what is in the above regid list.\r\n\r\nSo, for a short conclusion -- **does anyone have any idea what is going wrong in the above?**\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/aa645736%28v=vs.94%29?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396\r\n  [2]: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/tzat5yw6(v=vs.94)\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3BCEf.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164520/grapher-com-connection-to-c","title":"Grapher COM Connection to C#"},{"tags":["elasticsearch","caching"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19594,"user_id":1138192,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ed67a4983ab0568593e133930430941?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Always Sunny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1138192/always-sunny"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569834246,"creation_date":1569834246,"answer_id":58164634,"question_id":58164515,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58164634","body_markdown":"&gt; By default, the requests cache will only cache the results of search\r\n&gt; requests where  **size=0**, so it will not cache `hits`, but it will\r\n&gt; cache `hits.total`, `aggregations`, and `suggestions`.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `request_cache` query-string parameter can be used to **enable or disable** caching on a per-request basis.

the [Human Interface Guidelines for tvOS under &quot;Tab Bar Customization&quot;][1] it states that:\r\n\r\n&gt; In addition, you can display a logo or other information when the tab\r\n&gt; bar is visible by supplying accessory views that appear near the\r\n&gt; leading and trailing ends of the tab bar.\r\n\r\n \r\nIn the `UITabBar` docs the the following property is available:\r\n\r\n    trailingAccessoryView\r\n\r\n&gt; The view at the trailing edge of a tab bar on tvOS. Use this property\r\n&gt; to integrate a custom view at the leading edge of your tab bar\r\n&gt; interface. Use this view to display a custom logo or give access to\r\n&gt; custom accessories in your app.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uitabbar/3213944-leadingaccessoryview\r\n\r\n \r\nAnd there is a [trailing version][2] too.\r\n\r\n-\r\n \r\nHOWEVER... `trailingAccessoryView` is defined as read only:\r\n\r\n    var leadingAccessoryView: UIView { get }\r\n\r\n \r\nSo it can not be set directly in code.\r\n \r\nI&#39;ve found no way to set it in a Storyboard file, either directly on a UITabBarController UITabBar, on a UITabBar placed directly on a view controller, or by draging UIViews across onto the UITabBar.\r\n \r\nI&#39;ve also tried setting it by creating a custom UITabBar and overriding that property, like so:\r\nclass CustomTabBar: \r\n\r\n    UITabBar {       \r\n        override var leadingAccessoryView: UIView {  \r\n            return UIImageView(image: UIImage(named: &quot;example-image&quot;))  \r\n        }  \r\n    }  \r\n\r\n \r\nI&#39;ve verified that I have set the tab bar in storyboard to my custom one, and it is using the custom one, but the `leadingAccessoryView` value is never accessed, and the view it returns is never displayed.\r\n \r\n-\r\n \r\n**How does one set a `leadingAccessoryView` on a `UITabBar` in tvOS?**\r\n \r\n-\r\n \r\n*Environment:*\r\n\r\n*Xcode version 11.0 (11A420a)*\r\n\r\n*Project deployment target: tvOS 13.0*\r\n\r\n*Simulator: Apple TV 4K - tvOS 13.0 (17J577)*\r\n\r\n*This question

All until now had no relation with android framework (buttons, Spinners etc), or resources. Now I&#39;ve run up to a method in which i need to access an array from my resources (arrays.xml for example), but i cant do it since there is no context available. This is one case. Another case is that i have a method, as shown in code below, that takes parameter that is from Android framework (example Context) and uses it to do some work.\r\n\r\nMocking won&#39;t help, since the array is pretty big and recreating it in test i think it is not considered a good practice (since you should be able to access it from resources. Isn&#39;t this the correct approach for building a proper unit test?). I&#39;ve read about instrumentation unit tests but i wasn&#39;t able to find a proper example of how should this be done. Most of it was for UI testing. Below is the code from case 2 i described:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic void aMethod(Context context){\r\n    //work\r\n    context.getResounces.getString(aString);\r\n    //more work\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n Unit tests are supposed to be detached from Android dependencies, so my question, presenting these 2 cases is, how am i supposed to write unit tests for a method that requires Android resources/components? Is it untestable and i need to test them within an instrumentation test, when i will be testing the UI instead of unit test? Do i need to write the so-called instrumentation unit tests for these cases? And if i do, is there a best practice that i should be following?

missing bit is in `isSource`, where the taint tracking starts from the 0&#39;th argument to `fgets`. Using `asExpr` will describe the flow from that argument _into_ `fgets`. What we want is the flow _out of_ fgets through that argument. You&#39;ll get that by replacing `asExpr` with `asDefiningArgument`.\r\n\r\n[Here](https://lgtm.com/query/4743547486378660516/) is a link to the results for your query where I&#39;ve used both `asExpr` and `asDefiningArgument` in `isSource`.

Thread-2 and Thread-3 are invoked to update a variable in critical section guarded by a lock or a mutex \r\n\r\nCritical section using this guard allows only one thread to enter, Thread-2 and Thread-3 wait just outside. \r\n\r\nOnce this variable is updated by Thread-1; Thread-2 and Thread-3 resume with other work without causing an effect on the variable. \r\n\r\nI have come up with the following implementation, but I am not able to make other threads wait and skip updation: \r\n\r\n    public class Main {\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        private static ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();\r\n        private int counter = 0;\r\n    \r\n        public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n            Main m = new Main();\r\n    \r\n            new Thread(m::doSomeOperation).start();\r\n    \r\n            new Thread(m::doSomeOperation).start();\r\n    \r\n            new Thread(m::doSomeOperation).start();\r\n            \r\n    \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        private void doSomeOperation() {\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            System.out.println(&quot;Thread about to acquire lock: &quot;

+ counter + &quot; worked by thread &quot; + Thread.currentThread().getName());\r\n            }\r\n\r\n        } catch (Exception ex) {\r\n            ex.printStackTrace();\r\n        } finally {\r\n            if (lock.isHeldByCurrentThread()) {\r\n                lock.unlock();\r\n                System.out.println(&quot;Unlocked: &quot;

However, for the categories, I want this to display a view that lists all the categories instead.\r\n\r\nI know that this is possible by having two different route objects - one that matches `/admin/forms/categories` and one that matches `/admin/form/:status`, but I was wondering if it was possible to combine the two, or have a way of creating the two routes so that it doesn&#39;t matter what order I define them (if I put my category route below the status route, then the category view won&#39;t show, for example).  For this, I thought something like (`/admin/forms/(:status(?!categories))` would work, but I am getting a &quot;Nothing to repeat&quot; error from Vue Router.\r\n\r\nIs this something that is possible to do in Vue Router?

Instead you have a locally scoped variable which you pass to your function. \r\n\r\nWhen you create a variable you are just creating an alias to point to the memory location of an object. In the below code we are creating a list which is an object and has a string object inside it. We then create the name mylist and point it to the memory location of the list object. \r\n\r\n    mylist = [1]\r\n\r\nWhen you then pass mylist to a function what happens is the function gets a copy of the memory location that mylist points to and the function sets its local variable to point to that memory location. \r\n\r\nSo when you do an action which mutates the object in that memory location then that update will be seen also by the variable name outside the function since both point to the same memory location. \r\n\r\nIf however you were to reassign soemthing to that variable in the function like create a new list then that wouldnt reflect in the variable outside the function. Since what would actually be happening is a new object would be created and the local scope variable would be pointed to it. that wouldnt change the memory address of the variable outside of the function which would still point to the original location.\r\n\r\n    def first():\r\n        mylist = [1]\r\n        print(&quot;mylist:&quot;, mylist)\r\n        print(&quot;mylist id:&quot;, id(mylist))\r\n        second(mylist)\r\n        third(mylist)\r\n        print(&quot;mylist:&quot;, mylist)\r\n        print(&quot;mylist id:&quot;, id(mylist))\r\n    \r\n    def second(second_list):\r\n        #here the local function variable second_list points to the same memory location as mylist\r\n        print(&quot;second id:&quot;, id(second_list))\r\n        #Here we change the values in this memory location.

For example in `update_board` I pass `board` as a parameter, and update it inside the function, but don&#39;t return the updated board, yet it still gets updated. So it appears I&#39;m basically using a global value for `board`.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent, should I avoid passing the `board` parameter and use `global board` instead? I know globals are discouraged, but it&#39;s maybe at least better to be explicit about them. Or would it be better to replace instances of `update_board(board, row, col)` with `board = update_board(board, row, col)` and return `board` from `update_board` instead?\r\n\r\nOr have I possibly hit upon a valid approach quite by accident as the code stands?\r\n\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    Chomp - a strategy game\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    import random\r\n    import time\r\n    \r\n    NUM_ROWS = 5\r\n    NUM_COLS = 6\r\n    \r\n    FILLED_SPOT = &quot;#&quot;\r\n    POISON_SPOT = &quot;P&quot;\r\n    EMPTY_SPOT = &quot; &quot;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def print_title():\r\n        print(r&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n     ______     __  __     ______     __    __     ______  \r\n    /\\  ___\\   /\\ \\_\\ \\   /\\  __ \\   /\\ &quot;-./  \\   /\\  == \\ \r\n    \\ \\ \\____  \\ \\  __ \\  \\ \\ \\/\\ \\  \\ \\ \\-./\\ \\  \\ \\  _-/ \r\n     \\ \\_____\\  \\ \\_\\ \\_\\  \\ \\_____\\  \\ \\_\\ \\ \\_\\  \\ \\_\\   \r\n      \\/_____/   \\/_/\\/_/   \\/_____/   \\/_/  \\/_/   \\/_/   \r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    def print_instructions():\r\n        print(&quot;Welcome to Chomp.

can I query a pandas dataframe to get the records that are associated with different values on under one column? It&#39;s essentially a co-query:\r\n\r\n    data = {&quot;id&quot;: [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;f&quot;, &quot;f&quot;],\r\n    \t\t&quot;x&quot;: [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 5, 1, 7, 2, 4, 9, 11],\r\n    \t\t&quot;y&quot;: [1985, 1986, 1987, 1985, 1987, 1990, 1985, 1994, 1985, 1989, 1993, 1993]}\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame(data)\r\n    print(df)\r\n\r\n       id   x     y\r\n    0   a   1  1985\r\n    1   a   2  1986\r\n    2   a   3  1987\r\n    3   b   1  1985\r\n    4   b   3  1987\r\n    5   c   5  1990\r\n    6   c   1  1985\r\n    7   d   7  1994\r\n    8   e   2  1985\r\n    9   f   4  1989\r\n    10  f   9  1993\r\n    11  f  11  1993\r\n\r\nGiven the above data I would like to get write a function `f(id1, id2, year=None)` that would look for `x` that are associated with both id1 and id2. So `f(&#39;a&#39;, &#39;b&#39;)` would return a data frame that corresponds to {x: [1, 3], y: [1985, 1987]} \r\n\r\n       x     y\r\n    0  1  1985\r\n    1  3  1987 \r\n\r\n since both x=1 and x=3 are associated with both &#39;a&#39; and &#39;b&#39;.\r\n\r\nIdeally I want to be able do this in a way which allows for filtering by the &#39;y&#39; values as well. Also the dataframe is pretty big and this is a utility function that will be run often, so efficiency is important. I have thought of querying twice with different ids and merging:\r\n\r\n    In [15]: pd.merge(df.query(&#39;id==&quot;a&quot;&#39;), df.query(&#39;id==&quot;b&quot;&#39;), on=&#39;x&#39;)\r\n    Out[15]:\r\n      id_x  x   y_x id_y   y_y\r\n    0    a  1  1985    b  1985\r\n    1    a  3  1987    b  1987\r\n\r\n but I have a feeling that&#39;s not the most elegant and efficient way.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164437/getting-records-that-match-two-values-under-the-same-column-looking-for-shared","title":"Getting records that match two values under the same column (looking for shared associations)"},{"tags":["python","mysql"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1039,"user_id":825093,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87f060b749a77b7f6d03c3d6f56d3873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"silleknarf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/825093/silleknarf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1039,"user_id":825093,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87f060b749a77b7f6d03c3d6f56d3873?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"silleknarf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/825093/silleknarf"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569843062,"last_edit_date":1569843062,"creation_date":1569842582,"answer_id":58166920,"question_id":58164435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58166920","body_markdown":"I think you need to add a `%` in between the string and the parameters on this this line:\r\n\r\n    sql = &quot;INSERT INTO get_xici(thread_name, url, proxy, status, code, speedtime, memo) VALUES(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%d&#39;, &#39;%f&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;)&quot; (thread_name, url, proxy, status, code, speedtime, memo)\r\n                \r\nto:\r\n                                                                                                                     \r\n    sql = &quot;INSERT INTO get_xici(thread_name, url, proxy, status, code, speedtime, memo) VALUES(&#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;, &#39;%d&#39;, &#39;%f&#39;, &#39;%s&#39;)&quot; % (thread_name, url, proxy, status, code, speedtime, memo)      \r\n\r\nIn general though, you should use [prepared statements](http://zetcode.com/python/pymysql/) rather than string interpolation for generating SQL queries for security reasons (preventing SQL injection).

Why I have to use `    @WebAppConfiguration` and `@ContextConfiguration`? Why doesn&#39;t `@SpringBootTest` load the `application.yml` `spring.jackson.xx` values?\r\n\r\nOr, to make sure the `application.yml` is loaded, how to limit the classes to load in a `SpringBootTest` to minimize the number of classes to load, and speed up the tests?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nIf I delete `@WebAppConfiguration` and `ContextConfiguration`, and add `@SpringBootTest(class = MyApplication.class)`, it also loads all the context/launch the whole app and works. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164420/spring-boot-tests-and-jackson-get-an-instance-of-objectmapper-from-context-set","title":"Spring Boot tests and Jackson - Get an instance of ObjectMapper from context settings (application.yml) in tests without overhead config"},{"tags":["relationship","alloy"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12763,"user_id":243991,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":22,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a11af2fdbb73a5b23029ce3c1a94cade?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peter Kriens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/243991/peter-kriens"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569837218,"post_id":58164416,"comment_id":102712555,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164416/alloy-arity-of-relations#comment102712555_58164416"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12141549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MlN933rtZPk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcLk0wYOlIwM9iar49XLCMaIwxL_g/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Adja Ndeye Sylla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12141549/adja-ndeye-sylla"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569833360,"creation_date":1569833360,"question_id":58164416,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58164416","body_markdown":"I got this error &quot;In this scope, universe contains 1301 atoms and relations of arity 3 cannot be repesented&quot; with an Alloy code.

The format line just performs additional transformation into the string that it is going to place into &quot;item&quot;.

binding requires that you call `CefSharp.BindObjectAsync` in javascript before you can access the object. I also recommend wrapping your code in an anon closure when it&#39;s more than a single line.\r\n\r\nAn example would look something like\r\n\r\n    (async function()\r\n    {\r\n    \tawait CefSharp.BindObjectAsync(&quot;cb&quot;);\r\n    \t\r\n    \t//Object with name cb will have been bound, you can now access\r\n    \t\r\n    \tfunction insertBefore(el, referenceNode) {\r\n    \t\treferenceNode.parentNode.insertBefore(el, referenceNode);\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \tvar newEl = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\n    \tnewEl.className = &#39;exampleclass&#39;;\r\n    \tnewEl.innerHTML = &#39;&lt;a onclick=&quot;cb.dosomthing();&quot;&gt;Do somthing&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    \tvar ref = document.getElementById(&#39;example-tab&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    \tinsertBefore(newEl, ref);\r\n    })();\r\n\r\nAlso `MessageBox.Show` should be called on the `UI` thread, the `BoundObject.dosomething` method will be called on a background thread. A simple solution is to pass a reference to your `Form/Window/Control` (not sure if you are using `WinForms` or `WPF`, so I cannot say exactly) then Invoke the call back onto your `UI` thread. For testing purposes what you have should be ok, if you want to do anything more serious then you should change your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164360/callback-on-a-website-not-working-using-cefsharp-in-c/58165963#58165963","title":"Callback on a website not working using CefSharp in C#"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":5302292,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0dbb27eff486338cab1accd57fb9ec11?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mug Mug","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5302292/mug-mug"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569839198,"creation_date":1569833098,"question_id":58164360,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58164360","body_markdown":"Im trying to get a callback using cefsharp on a website i dont own.\r\n\r\nOn the launching of my application i bind the tag &quot;cb&quot;\r\n```\r\nchromeBrowser.JavascriptObjectRepository.Register(&quot;cb&quot;, new BoundObject(), true);\r\n\r\npublic class BoundObject\r\n{\r\n     public void dosomthing()\r\n     {\r\n          MessageBox.Show(&quot;It worked!&quot;);\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing the following javascript script i add an object to the website:\r\n```\r\nfunction insertBefore(el, referenceNode) {\r\n    referenceNode.parentNode.insertBefore(el, referenceNode);\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar newEl = document.createElement(&#39;div&#39;);\r\nnewEl.className = &#39;exampleclass&#39;;\r\nnewEl.innerHTML = &#39;&lt;a onclick=&quot;cb.dosomthing();&quot;&gt;Do somthing&lt;/a&gt;&#39;;\r\n\r\nvar ref = document.getElementById(&#39;example-tab&#39;);\r\n\r\ninsertBefore(newEl, ref);\r\n```\r\n\r\nI perform this using:\r\n```\r\nExecuteScriptAsyncWhenPageLoaded\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen when i click the added in element with the text &quot;Do somthing&quot;, nothing happens.\r\n\r\nWhat am i doing wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164360/callback-on-a-website-not-working-using-cefsharp-in-c","title":"Callback on a website not working using CefSharp in C#"},{"tags":["powershell","windows-shell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":463,"user_id":11801537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5uLEl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ng-suhas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11801537/ng-suhas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569833594,"post_id":58164358,"comment_id":102710608,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164358/disable-autocomplete-search-in-the-run-dialog-on-windows#comment102710608_58164358"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":157243,"user_id":1630171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oIS66.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ansgar Wiechers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1630171/ansgar-wiechers"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569834209,"creation_date":1569834209,"answer_id":58164627,"question_id":58164358,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58164627","body_markdown":"According to [this article][1] you need to create a key &quot;AutoComplete&quot;

`routes.api.Travel` has and object of `Cart` now when I import the `routes.api.Cart` it will refer to `routes.api.Travel.Cart` instead of `routes.api.Cart`\r\n\r\nIs there something with python3? or did I misconfigured the packages I created?\r\n\r\nfor the meantime, I&#39;m changing my packages not in order not to be conflicted to other subdirectory or class of the file, I also read about the

The result of the conversion, which is a `prvalue temporary (until C++17)` `prvalue expression (since C++17)` if a converting constructor was used, is then used to direct-initialize the object.\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n(emphasis mine)\r\n&gt; if T is a class type and the initializer is a prvalue expression whose cv-unqualified type is the same class as T, **the initializer expression itself, rather than a temporary materialized from it, is used to initialize the destination object**\r\n\r\nThat means `a` is initialized from `0` directly, there&#39;s no *temporary* to be constructed and then no longer a *temporary* to copy/move from.\r\n\r\nBefore C++17, in concept `std::atomic&lt;int&gt; a = 0;` requires a temporary `std::atomic` to be constructed from `0`, then the temporary is used to copy-construct `a`.\r\n\r\nEven [copy elision](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision) is allowed before C++17, it&#39;s considered as an optimization:\r\n\r\n(emphasis mine)\r\n&gt; This is an optimization: even when it takes place and the copy/`move (since C++11)` constructor is not called, **it still must be present and accessible (as if no optimization happened at all), otherwise the program is ill-formed**:\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why gcc triggers diagnostic in pre-c++17 mode for `std::atomic&lt;int&gt; a = 0;` .\r\n\r\n(emphasis mine)\r\n&gt; Note: the rule above does not specify an optimization: C++17 core language specification of prvalues and temporaries is **fundamentally different from that of the earlier C++ revisions: there is no longer a temporary to copy/move from**. Another way to describe C++17 mechanics is &quot;unmaterialized value passing&quot;: **prvalues are returned and used without ever materializing a temporary**.\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt; BTW: I suppose there was a bug in `g++ 6.5.0` with `-std=c++17`; and it has been fixed in later version.&lt;/sup&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58164350/member-initialization-for-non-copyable-variable-in-c17/58164418#58164418","title":"Member initialization for non-copyable
