I&#39;m trying to move the application to OWIN (ASP.NET Core is not an option at this stage) to utilize `Microsoft.Owin.Testing.TestServer`, where `HttpContext.Current` will not work because it&#39;s tightly coupled with IIS through System.Web assembly.\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m trying to implement an alternative using `System.Net.Http.HttpRequestMessage` (I realize this is a different type but I believe I can refactor my way out of it). The basic idea is to add a `System.Net.Http.DelegatingHandler` to Web API which will intercept the incoming request and assign it to a static property. This property will replace usages of `HttpContext.Current`. Now, before you propose using the `ApiController.Request` property - the static field is used deep in a dependency graph, so passing it as parameter all the way from the controller would be difficult if not impossible.\r\n\r\nBecause there are multiple requests handled in parallel, a simple static property with implicit field would not work. It would get overwritten constantly by different threads handling the requests. I could use a `ThreadStaticAttribute` but there&#39;s still a risk with `async` - if a request is handled by multiple threads, my field could end up being null (or worse yet, another request).\r\n\r\n# Original question\r\n\r\nTo mitigate this, I&#39;m thinking of binding each request to `SynchronizationContext.Current` in a dictionary which will back the static property. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CurrentRequestProvider\r\n{\r\n    private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary&lt;SynchronizationContext, HttpRequestMessage&gt; Requests =\r\n      new ConcurrentDictionary&lt;SynchronizationContext, HttpRequestMessage&gt;();\r\n\r\n    static HttpRequestMessage CurrentRequest\r\n    {\r\n      get\r\n      {\r\n        if (SynchronizationContext.Current is object &amp;&amp;\r\n            Requests.TryGetValue(SynchronizationContext.Current, out var request))\r\n        {\r\n          return request;\r\n        }\r\n        return null;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen the `DelegatingHandler` is nested in `CurrentRequestProvider`, so it has access to the `Requests` dictionary:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SetCurrentRequestHandler : DelegatingHandler\r\n{\r\n    protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            Requests.AddOrUpdate(SynchronizationContext.Current, request, (sc, r) =&gt; request);\r\n            /* Execute controller&#39;s actions and everything */\r\n            return await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);\r\n        }\r\n        finally\r\n        {\r\n            /* Clean up the dictionary of requests */\r\n            Requests.TryRemove(SynchronizationContext.Current, out _);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, onto my question to multi-threading gurus :). Is it enough to use `ConcurrentDictionary` as I did to ensure thread safety in this scenario, or should I add some extra locking in `CurrentRequest`&#39;s getter or somewhere else? Do you spot any other potential problems with this workaround?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n# Update with solution\r\n\r\nacelent&#39;s comment below directed me to a better approach based on `AsyncLocal&lt;T&gt;`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass CurrentRequestProvider\r\n{\r\n    private static readonly AsyncLocal&lt;HttpRequestMessage&gt; AsyncLocalRequest =\r\n      new AsyncLocal&lt;HttpRequestMessage&gt;();\r\n\r\n    static HttpRequestMessage CurrentRequest =&gt; AsyncLocalRequest.Value;\r\n\r\n    class SetCurrentRequestHandler : DelegatingHandler\r\n    {\r\n        protected override async Task&lt;HttpResponseMessage&gt; SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n        {\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                AsyncLocalRequest.Value = request;\r\n                /* Execute controller&#39;s actions and everything */\r\n                return await base.SendAsync(request, cancellationToken);\r\n            }\r\n            finally\r\n            {\r\n                AsyncLocalRequest.Value = null\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI don&#39;t see the need to provide extra thread-safety anymore with this approach (correct me if I&#39;m wrong).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372076/non-system-web-alternative-to-httpcontext-current","title":"Non System.Web alternative to HttpContext.Current"},{"tags":["c#",".net","ienumerator","nullablereferencetypes"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":224,"user_id":6622623,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/06RO1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gaboik1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622623/gaboik1"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571039458,"post_id":58372152,"comment_id":103093930,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372075/net-implement-ienumerator-with-nullable-reference-types/58372152#comment103093930_58372152"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1139226,"user_id":22656,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d8ebb117e8d83d74ea95fbdd0f87e13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jon Skeet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1139226,"user_id":22656,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d8ebb117e8d83d74ea95fbdd0f87e13?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jon Skeet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571043378,"last_edit_date":1571043378,"creation_date":1571039022,"answer_id":58372152,"question_id":58372075,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58372152","body_markdown":"I would definitely suggest it should be declared as the not-null version.

However, while tweaking a library of mine to support the new feature, I stumbled upon a &#39;problem&#39; to which I really couldn&#39;t find an answer anywhere. I&#39;ve looked at Microsoft&#39;s release notes and the .NET source code but no luck.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: the question is essentially whether or not an `IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;`&#39;s `Current` property should be declared as a nullable reference type.\r\n\r\nSuppose the following implementation of `IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;`:\r\n```\r\npublic class WebSocketClientEnumerator&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; : IEnumerator&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; where TWebSocketClient : WebSocketClient\r\n{\r\n    private WebSocketRoom&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; room;\r\n    private int curIndex;\r\n    private TWebSocketClient? curCli;\r\n\r\n    public WebSocketClientEnumerator(WebSocketRoom&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; room)\r\n    {\r\n        this.room = room;\r\n        curIndex = -1;\r\n        curCli = default(TWebSocketClient);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public bool MoveNext()\r\n    {\r\n        if (++curIndex &gt;= room.Count)\r\n        {\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            curCli = room[curIndex];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void Reset() { curIndex = -1; }\r\n\r\n    void IDisposable.Dispose() { }\r\n\r\n    public TWebSocketClient? Current\r\n    {\r\n        get { return curCli; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    object IEnumerator.Current\r\n    {\r\n        get { return Current; }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd suppose the following code to consume the enumerator:\r\n```\r\npublic class WebSocketRoom&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; : ICollection&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt; where TWebSocketClient : WebSocketClient\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n\r\n    public void UseEnumerator()\r\n    {\r\n        var e = new WebSocketClientEnumerator&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt;(this);\r\n        bool hasNext = e.MoveNext();\r\n        if (hasNext)\r\n        {\r\n            WebSocketClient c = e.Current; // &lt;= Warning on this line\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code, as it is, will generate a warning because, obviously, the return type of `WebSocketClientEnumerator&lt;TWebSocketClient&gt;.Current` is a nullable reference type.\r\n\r\nThe `IEnumerator` interface is designed in such a way that one &#39;should&#39; call the `IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;.MoveNext()` method to know beforehand if the enumerator has a next value, thereby accomplishing some kind of void safety but obviously, to the eyes of the compiler this means nothing, calling the `MoveNext()` method doesn&#39;t intrinsically guarantee that the enumerator&#39;s `Current` property is not null.\r\n\r\nI would like my library to compile without warnings though and the compiler won&#39;t let me leave `this.curCli` with a `null` value in the constructor if it is not declared as a nullable reference type and if it is declared nullable then the &#39;burden&#39; of checking for a null reference is transferred to the client of the library. Granted, enumerators are generally consumed trough `foreach` statements hence it&#39;s mostly handeled by the runtime and it&#39;s probably not that big of a deal. It is true that semantically speaking, it makes sense for an enumerator&#39;s `Current` property to be `null` because there might be no data to enumerate, but I really do see a conflict between the `IEnumerator&lt;T&gt;` interface and the nullable reference type feature. I&#39;m really wondering if there&#39;s a way to make the compiler happy while still maintaining the functionality.

I have found a method for delete that I quite like, but other alternatives can be presented. Here is how my function looks like:\r\n\r\n      deleteFromList(forDeletion, myList) {\r\n          myList = myList.filter(item =&gt; item !== forDeletion);                 \r\n      }\r\n\r\nAs you see, I am passing the list as a parameter to this function (instead of accessing the list from the component where I am now). I do this because I want to call this function for another delete operation for *another list* that I have in the same file, so I must know not only which element to delete, but from which of the lists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is that passing the list from HTML and change that *parameter list variable* will not change the actual variable from the component which I am iterating on. Is there a clean and ethical solution to this? And why isn&#39;t that list variable changing if I change the *param list variable*?\r\n\r\n Thank you! :)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372049/change-an-angular-components-variable-by-passing-it-from-the-html","title":"Change an Angular component&#39;s variable by passing it from the HTML"},{"tags":["linux","docker","message-queue","shared-memory"],"owner":{"reputation":408,"user_id":5604249,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7bed34ebe08c34a10addbea1bf85ff17?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Pharaoh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5604249/pharaoh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":12,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571038513,"creation_date":1571038513,"question_id":58372042,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58372042","body_markdown":"I have a requirement where i have a service running in a container(Ubuntu Host), that needs to communicate with a service running on the host machine, now one way to achieve this is using TCP or UDP, but i wanted to use System V queues, is it possible for a service in the container to access the queue created on the host.\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372042/access-system-v-queue-created-in-host-from-docker-container","title":"Access System V queue created in host from docker container"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","html","frontend"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1641,"user_id":10555785,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LjnQT.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chans","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10555785/chans"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571038665,"post_id":58372041,"comment_id":103093539,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372041/changing-background-color-on-a-series-of-tab-in-javascript#comment103093539_58372041"},{"owner":{"reputation":3133,"user_id":10955263,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac8352744d1489964dc9ea418be332ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"04FS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10955263/04fs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571038743,"post_id":58372041,"comment_id":103093577,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58372041/changing-background-color-on-a-series-of-tab-in-javascript#comment103093577_58372041"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":318,"user_id":8472578,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44937187139ba690e4f2e62940876a40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Max","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8472578/max"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571039037,"creation_date":1571039037,"answer_id":58372158,"question_id":58372041,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58372158","body_markdown":"You could change your JavaScript to the below.

np\r\n\r\n    Z = np.random.rand(100,100)\r\n\r\n    plt.contourf(Z, 100, cmap=&#39;RdGy&#39;, vmin=0, vmax=1)\r\n    plt.colorbar()\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\nUsing the above code I get this plot:  \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]  \r\n  \r\nBut if I change only one row of Z to contain extreme values it &quot;dominates&quot; the whole plot:  \r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as

things obviously happen in the range of 0 and 1, which is totally dominated by the multiplication I entered in the 1st row, even though I set vmin and vmax accordingly. How do I keep the data as is, while &quot;focusing&quot; on the 0-1 range? I don&#39;t really care what goes on in the first row, for all I care there can be a single color for the values 1-100.  \r\n\r\nMany Thanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mxNHa.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2AIh8.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371995/matplotlib-contourf-with-extreme-values","title":"matplotlib contourf with extreme values"},{"tags":["node.js","jestjs","travis-ci"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1882,"user_id":808236,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1017506697/picture?type=large","display_name":"iamkhush","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/808236/iamkhush"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571039096,"creation_date":1571039096,"answer_id":58372175,"question_id":58371992,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58372175","body_markdown":"Maybe try adding the following to `travis.yml`\r\n\r\n`before_script: chmod 0555 ./node_modules/.bin/travis`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371992/cannot-build-run-test-properly-in-travis-permission-denied/58372175#58372175","title":"Cannot build / run test properly in travis.

I can navigate from front-end by router.navigate() but how can i perform redirection?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371979/how-can-we-do-301-and-302-redirection-with-angular-and-node-angular-app-is-work","title":"How can we do 301 and 302 redirection with angular and node?

Winforms API, and the native Win32 window-messaging API on which it&#39;s built, is simply not designed for &quot;smooth animation&quot;. It will be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve perfectly smooth animation.\r\n\r\nThat said, much can be done to improve on your attempt above:\r\n\r\n* Don&#39;t use `CreateGraphics()`. Instead, always draw in response to the `Paint` event.\r\n* Don&#39;t use any of the .NET timer implementations to schedule rendering. Instead, draw as quickly as you can, taking into account time between frames to update your object position.\r\n\r\nApplying these ideas, here&#39;s a version of your code that works _much_ better:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nconst float speedXPerSecond = 1000f / 30;\r\nconst int bar_width = 40;\r\n\r\npublic Form1()\r\n{\r\n    InitializeComponent();\r\n    DoubleBuffered = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfloat x_position = 0;\r\nTimeSpan _lastFrameTime = TimeSpan.Zero;\r\nStopwatch _frameTimer = Stopwatch.StartNew();\r\n\r\nprotected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n    base.OnPaint(e);\r\n\r\n    TimeSpan currentFrameTime = _frameTimer.Elapsed;\r\n    float distance = (float)(currentFrameTime - _lastFrameTime).TotalSeconds * speedXPerSecond;\r\n\r\n    x_position += distance;\r\n    while (x_position &gt; this.Width) x_position -= this.Width;\r\n    e.Graphics.FillRectangle(Brushes.Black, x_position, 0, bar_width, 500);\r\n    _lastFrameTime = currentFrameTime;\r\n\r\n    Invalidate();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can apply this general technique to any interactive scenario. A real game will have other elements to this general &quot;render loop&quot;, including user input and updating game state (e.g. based on a physics model). These will add overhead to the render loop, and will necessarily reduce frame rate. But for any basic game on any reasonably recent hardware (e.g. built in the last couple of decades), the net frame rate will still be well above that needed for acceptably smooth game-play.\r\n\r\nDo note that in the managed .NET/Winforms context, there will always be limits to the success of this approach as compared to using a lower-level API. In particular, without some extra work on your part, garbage collection will interrupt periodically, causing the frame rate to stutter slightly, as well unevenness in thread scheduling and the thread&#39;s message queue.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s been my experience that people asking this sort of question don&#39;t need things to be absolutely perfect. They need &quot;good enough&quot;, so that they can move on to learning about other topics involved in game development.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371974/how-to-create-smooth-animation-movement-of-shapes-in-c-windows-forms-applicatio/58385402#58385402","title":"How to create smooth animation movement of shapes in C# windows forms application?"}],"owner":{"reputation":551,"user_id":353325,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e086e38509d687f7062dad886ecaab3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"EgyEast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/353325/egyeast"},"last_editor":{"reputation":551,"user_id":353325,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e086e38509d687f7062dad886ecaab3b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"EgyEast","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/353325/egyeast"},"comment_count":17,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58385402,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571097117,"creation_date":1571038248,"last_edit_date":1571096022,"question_id":58371974,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58371974","body_markdown":"I&#39;m making C# windows forms application in which I want to make smooth animation movement of a black bar over a white background.

I am writing Spring boot application to move data from Database in source A to another Database in source B. To do so, I am trying to configure Spring with two datasource and tried to retrive data from source A concurrently and insert to source B. I could retrieve data from source A but the problem is that I could not insert those data to source B. It seems like I didn&#39;t configure transactional correctly with EntityManager. Please check my below code and help me figure out this. \r\n\r\nHere is my datasource configuration class:\r\n```\r\n@Configuration\r\n@EnableJpaRepositories(\r\n        basePackages =

This is a disadvantage of `auto`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371951/compiler-not-recognising-overloaded-method/58372351#58372351","title":"Compiler not recognising overloaded method"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":4031282,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8da76124e66bf23971580c53eb35aa81?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4031282/andrew"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571043029,"creation_date":1571043029,"answer_id":58373146,"question_id":58371951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58373146","body_markdown":"There were several errors...no case on the switch in the erase method and not correctly addressing the correct level of the hierarchy in order to initialise the start and finish iterators.

[This example][1] may help you to start which I found in 5 minutes of searching. If you are confused about websocket implementation at all it&#39;s a good idea to try [websocket for web][2] at first by simple example.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use NodeJS you may probably want to use existing library [something like this][3].\r\n\r\nIn case of Java there is SockJS usually used out of the box as standard library for client. So you have to find or make something similar but for C++ if you have enough skills or try to configure simple websocket connection as for PHP.\r\n\r\nI have used [Firebase][4] library for bidirectional communication with ESP8266, because it is pretty simple and free for small projects. The main benefit of this approach that you don&#39;t need to maintain your backend, it just works 24/7 since you&#39;ve configured connection and business logic. Probably [this is what are you looking for][5]. Also you can host static pages on Firebase cloud as well if you need kind of admin interface.

All the examples seem to be for local servers and I cannot find anything that shows what needs to be included in the website end to get a successful connection.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any experience with webSockets and BlueHost I would appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nRichard \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371942/esp8266-websocket-with-bluehost","title":"ESP8266 WebSocket with BlueHost"},{"tags":["javascript","html","svg","canvas"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":92,"user_id":6781694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1171631822876152/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sarath Damaraju","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6781694/sarath-damaraju"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571038338,"post_id":58371940,"comment_id":103093381,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371940/how-to-draw-an-animated-svg-to-a-canvas-at-a-specific-time-offset#comment103093381_58371940"},{"owner":{"reputation":3290,"user_id":793961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/367cd54226af527423507c1f89abb25a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"muffel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/793961/muffel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":92,"user_id":6781694,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1171631822876152/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sarath Damaraju","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6781694/sarath-damaraju"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571038521,"post_id":58371940,"comment_id":103093472,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371940/how-to-draw-an-animated-svg-to-a-canvas-at-a-specific-time-offset#comment103093472_58371940"},{"owner":{"reputation":84980,"user_id":1038015,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c5d912dac5c74b47bbaff7164f5f8bb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Robert Longson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1038015/robert-longson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571042447,"post_id":58371940,"comment_id":103095372,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371940/how-to-draw-an-animated-svg-to-a-canvas-at-a-specific-time-offset#comment103095372_58371940"},{"owner":{"reputation":55596,"user_id":3702797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LbM0l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kaiido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3702797/kaiido"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571053023,"post_id":58371940,"comment_id":103100778,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371940/how-to-draw-an-animated-svg-to-a-canvas-at-a-specific-time-offset#comment103100778_58371940"},{"owner":{"reputation":55596,"user_id":3702797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LbM0l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kaiido","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3702797/kaiido"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571053029,"post_id":58371940,"comment_id":103100780,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371940/how-to-draw-an-animated-svg-to-a-canvas-at-a-specific-time-offset#comment103100780_58371940"}],"owner":{"reputation":3290,"user_id":793961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/367cd54226af527423507c1f89abb25a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"muffel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/793961/muffel"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571038127,"creation_date":1571038127,"question_id":58371940,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58371940","body_markdown":"Consider any animated SVG defined as HTML `&lt;svg&gt;` tag.

In that case, you have no options for App Engine today. I would deploy to a different service (Kubernetes) better suited for your system goals that can provided managed secrets.\r\n\r\n**[END UPDATE]**\r\n\r\nYou have two choices for secrets for App Engine Standard:\r\n\r\n 1. Store the secrets as environment variables in app.yaml\r\n 2. Store the secrets someplace else.\r\n\r\nFor both options, you can add a layer of security by encrypting them. However, adding encryption adds another secret (decryption key) that you must somehow provide to your app. The chicken-or-egg situation.\r\n\r\nApp Engine Standard uses a Service Account. This service account can be used as an identity to control access to other resources. Examples of other resources are KMS and Cloud Storage. This means that you can securely access KMS or Cloud Storage without adding another secret to App Engine.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume that your company wants all application secrets encrypted. We can use the App Engine Service Account as the identity authorized to access KMS for a single key.\r\n\r\nNote: The following examples use Windows syntax. Replace the line continuation `^` with `\\` for Linux/macOS.\r\n\r\n**Create the KMS Keyring. Keyrings cannot be deleted, so this is a one-time operation.**\r\n\r\n    set GCP_KMS_KEYRING=app-keyring\r\n    set GCP_KMS_KEYNAME=app-keyname\r\n\r\n    gcloud kms keyrings create&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYRING% --location global\r\n\r\n**Create the KMS Key.**\r\n\r\n    gcloud kms keys create&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYNAME% ^\r\n    --location global ^\r\n    --keyring&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYRING% ^\r\n    --purpose encryption\r\n\r\n**Add the service account to the KMS policy for the keyring and key that we created.** \r\n\r\nThis will allow App Engine to decrypt data without requiring secrets for KMS. The service account identity provides access control. No roles are required for KMS. You will need to provide the KMS Keyring and Keyname which can be included in app.yaml.\r\n\r\n    set GCP_SA=&lt;replace with the app engine service acccount email adddress&gt;\r\n    set GCP_KMS_ROLE=roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyDecrypter\r\n\r\n    gcloud kms keys add-iam-policy-binding&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYNAME% ^\r\n    --location global ^\r\n    --keyring&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYRING% ^\r\n    --member serviceAccount:%GCP_SA% ^\r\n    --role&#160;%GCP_KMS_ROLE%\r\n\r\nFor this example, let&#39;s assume that you need to access a MySQL database. We will store the credentials in a JSON file and encrypt it. The file is named `config.json`.\r\n\r\n    {\r\n            &quot;DB_HOST&quot;: &quot;127.0.0.1&quot;,\r\n            &quot;DB_PORT&quot;: &quot;3306&quot;,\r\n            &quot;DB_USER&quot;: &quot;Roberts&quot;,\r\n            &quot;DB_PASS&quot;: &quot;Keep-This-Secret&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Encrypt config.json using Cloud KMS and store the encrypted results in config.enc:**\r\n\r\n    call gcloud kms encrypt ^\r\n    --location=global ^\r\n    --keyring&#160;%GCP_KMS_KEYRING% ^\r\n    --key=%GCP_KMS_KEYNAME% ^\r\n    --plaintext-file=config.json ^\r\n    --ciphertext-file=config.enc\r\n\r\nThe encrypted file can be stored in Cloud Storage. Since it is encrypted, you could store the file with your build files, but I do not recommend that.\r\n\r\nThe final piece is to write the code in Java that is part of your program that uses KMS to decrypt the file config.enc using KMS.

This is problematic for me.\r\n\r\nAnother potential solution I&#39;ve seen is to delegate the problem to Google Cloud Build, so that it fetches a value/file from CKM and pushes it to App Engine ([1][3], [2][4]).

and audio + video is recorded. But it freezes the UI when call is answered. If i remove                 Thread.sleep(forTimeInterval: 1.5) then it will not freeze the UI, but in that case i am not getting audio buffer in sample delegate method.\r\nI have to put delay because i am using google webrtc library for video calling and it has its AVcapturesession added with videodata output. I am creating new AVCaptureSession and assigning google webrtc session to newly created session and the assigning audio data output.So if delay is removed then video buffer will be received but audio buffer will not be received. How to stop UI freeze and also get video and audio buffer simultaneously?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58371829/did-output-sample-buffer-only-gets-video-buffer-if-delay-is-removed","title":"Did Output Sample Buffer only gets video
