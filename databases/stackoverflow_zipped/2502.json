Though that still looks really weird to my eyes (`#if DBG` in C was way clearer)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/daff9066c0c4ed1108a391fe3efcf6df5ab905ca/src/_pytest/_code/code.py#L25\r\n  [2]: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/\r\n  [3]: https://github.com/python/typing/blob/master/src/typing.py","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939977/what-is-the-meaning-of-if-false-from-typing-import-type","title":"what is the meaning of &quot;if False: from typing import Type&quot;?"},{"tags":["r"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568505152,"post_id":57939976,"comment_id":102295364,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939976/how-can-i-use-e-tooltip-pie-formatter-to-convert-to-percent-in-tooltip#comment102295364_57939976"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12068528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC90CNJRDql_41Y8W2xNV-ba0vviNTiyk-Y1T11Qg=k-s128","display_name":"abe takuya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068528/abe-takuya"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568505883,"post_id":57939976,"comment_id":102295450,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939976/how-can-i-use-e-tooltip-pie-formatter-to-convert-to-percent-in-tooltip#comment102295450_57939976"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12068528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC90CNJRDql_41Y8W2xNV-ba0vviNTiyk-Y1T11Qg=k-s128","display_name":"abe takuya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068528/abe-takuya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":657,"user_id":10107864,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Vitali Avagyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10107864/vitali-avagyan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568504468,"creation_date":1568503154,"last_edit_date":1568504468,"question_id":57939976,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939976","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating an interactive pie chart by `echarts4r` for Rshiny apps. seems `e_tooltip_pie_formatter()` is the function to make a unit for value in the tooltip to percent, but I can&#39;t make it.

method are being output, but it is just not displaying.\r\n\r\nI know I&#39;ve provided a massive wall of code for all of you to sift through, so I will be extra appreciative to anybody willing to spend some time helping me out. I will provide any extra necessary info upon request. Thank you all in advance, and hopefully it&#39;s a comically trivial error I&#39;m making!\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-getting-started","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939950/android-destination-fragment-not-appearing-on-navigation","title":"Android Destination Fragment not Appearing on Navigation"},{"tags":["excel","excel-formula","periodicity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1112,"user_id":11652943,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qw3Ef.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AbdelAziz AbdelLatef","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11652943/abdelaziz-abdellatef"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568504087,"post_id":57939949,"comment_id":102295243,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939949/how-to-use-excel-data-to-find-period#comment102295243_57939949"},{"owner":{"reputation":3291,"user_id":4961700,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f80e4233c80b9ba42b3b39cf704804dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Solar Mike","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4961700/solar-mike"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568532847,"post_id":57939949,"comment_id":102298702,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939949/how-to-use-excel-data-to-find-period#comment102298702_57939949"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":10458973,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vNEJc8d4poQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAo/AdOkUKi0qzI/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"wolfwoof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10458973/wolfwoof"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568571957,"post_id":57939949,"comment_id":102307176,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939949/how-to-use-excel-data-to-find-period#comment102307176_57939949"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":11763668,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0C0c.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gianluca","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11763668/gianluca"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41,"user_id":11763668,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X0C0c.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gianluca","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11763668/gianluca"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568503457,"last_edit_date":1568503457,"creation_date":1568503104,"answer_id":57939969,"question_id":57939949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57939969","body_markdown":"In case the [`Analysis ToolPak`][1] is installed, one can use `Tools`-&gt;`Data Analysis`-&gt;`Fourier Analysis`.

answer is &#39;learn how to reference child controls&#39;, then call methods on the child control. \r\n\r\n\r\nThis page gives 3 good ideas on how to facilitate inter-component communication beyond the @input() method. None really addressed my situation... but they are 3 good ideas that work.\r\nhttps://medium.com/@mirokoczka/3-ways-to-communicate-between-angular-components-a1e3f3304ecb\r\n\r\nI realized there must be a way to reference other components directly in angular. I found this article about @ViewComponent\r\nhttps://alligator.io/angular/viewchild-access-component/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis page is a very good article on using @ViewComponent and works through 3 different examples. Very illustrative. Nice work.\r\nhttps://www.concretepage.com/angular-2/angular-2-viewchild-example\r\n\r\n\r\nUltimately the answer is to change the listcomponent so that it has a reference to the child detailcomponent. This is done using the @ViewComponent decorator as follows \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    export class propertyAnalysisListComponent implements OnInit, AfterViewInit{\r\n    \r\n      listFormGroup: FormGroup; \r\n      paVers: propertyAnalysisVersion[];\r\n      selectedpaVer: propertyAnalysisVersion;\r\n    \r\n      @ViewChild(propertyAnalysisDetailComponent)\r\n      private myDetail: propertyAnalysisDetailComponent;\r\n      \r\n\r\nIt&#39;s important to note (took me some fumbling to realize) that the final two lines are in fact 1 line. \r\n\r\nThe  declaration/type is being decorated w/ the @ViewChild. \r\n \r\nThe detail component is now addressable in the tr.click method of the documentList component\r\n\r\n\r\n      onRowClicked(evt: MouseEvent, paVer: propertyAnalysisVersion) {\r\n        //alert(paVer.versionName);\r\n        this.selectedpaVer = paVer;\r\n        this.myDetail.patchControls(paVer);  //set control values w/ the new data object\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n \r\nhope this helps someone else.

However, since it&#39;s a Binary Search Tree (BST), the condition for which path to take is known and, therefore, is possible to track which nodes are in a common path and which aren&#39;t.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, a BST search always starts from the root node, so it will always be part of the sum, assuming the BST has 3 nodes or more because we need two leafs. Secondly, it&#39;s essential to do a BST search for each leaf (`firstNumber`,`secondNumber`) to guarantee that we traveled each path&#39;s nodes, regardless if they are common or not. Finally, all that&#39;s left is to determine when a node is common in both paths, so we don&#39;t add the same value twice.\r\n\r\nA node is in the common path if both BST searches take the same path. So, you will have to run both simultaneously inside your function. We can account all the common nodes in the sum by using a do-while:\r\n\r\n    firstCurrentNode = tree.Root;\r\n    secondCurrentNode = tree.Root;\r\n    do {\r\n      sum += firstCurrentNode;\r\n      // FirstNumber path check:\r\n      if (firstNumber &lt; firstCurrentNode) firstCurrentNode = firstCurrentNode.goLeftNode();\r\n      else firstCurrentNode = firstCurrentNode.goRightNode();\r\n      // SecondNumber path check:\r\n      if (secondNumber &lt; secondCurrentNod) secondCurrentNode = secondCurrentNode.goLeftNode(); \r\n      else secondCurrentNode = secondCurrentNode.goRightNode(); \r\n    } while (firstCurrentNode == secondCurrentNode)\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce they are not equal, i.e, take different paths, due to the properties of a tree, they will never share a same path again. Therefore, we only need to continue the BST searches individually, including every node we find into the sum. However, we might have reached the leafs already, so it&#39;s necessary to check that first:\r\n\r\n    // Search for firstNumber\r\n    while(firstCurrentNode != firstNumber) {\r\n      sum += firstCurrentNode;\r\n      if (firstNumber &lt; firstCurrentNode) firstCurrentNode = firstCurrentNode.goLeftNode();\r\n      else firstCurrentNode = firstCurrentNode.goRightNode();\r\n    }\r\n    // Search for secondNumber\r\n    while(secondCurrentNode != secondNumber) {\r\n      sum += secondCurrentNode;\r\n      if (secondNumber &lt; secondCurrentNod) secondCurrentNode = secondCurrentNode.goLeftNode(); \r\n      else secondCurrentNode = secondCurrentNode.goRightNode();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOf course, I assumed that the leafs used exists in the tree and all nodes contains unique values and you can make adjustments for that, but this is one way to get the sum without using more memory space or get worse performance.\r\n     \r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939919/sum-of-nodes-between-two-bst-leaves/57940794#57940794","title":"Sum of nodes between two BST leaves"}],"owner":{"reputation":1096,"user_id":11104068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gueSe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11104068/saamer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1096,"user_id":11104068,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gueSe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11104068/saamer"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57940794,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568634214,"creation_date":1568502451,"last_edit_date":1568506088,"question_id":57939919,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939919","body_markdown":"I am NOT looking for Maximum Sum Path of a tree. I can create and find the sum of the binary search tree, but I need to find the sum of all the nodes between two leaves.\r\n\r\nFor example, for the BST built with these nodes : 5, 10, 13, 8, 3, 4, 5, the tree looks like this : \r\n```\r\n                         5\r\n                     /       \\\r\n                   3           10\r\n                    \\         /  \\\r\n                     4       8    13\r\n                            /\r\n                           5\r\n```\r\nSo if the input is 4 and 13, then the sum of nodes is 3+5+10=18. \r\n\r\nThe function could be something like this: `Sum(tree, firstNumber, secondNumber);`\r\n\r\nI am thinking to create two ordered lists of all the nodes until the root node and seeing if any of them are common, and then just adding up the values of all the unique nodes.

Which breakpoint is hit?  If the behavior seems to be normal with a simple unit test, repeat again with your code.\r\n\r\nIf the Modified breakpoint is hit, and only the Modified handler is hit then check the state of the CreatedDate value in the entity modified. Does it still reflect the original CreatedDate?  If yes, then it would appear that something in your schema will be overwriting it on save. If no then you have a bug in your code that has caused it to update. If it is #null then this might also explain the behaviour in that it is not being loaded with the entity for whatever reason. Check that the property has not been configured as something like a Computed property.\r\n\r\nIf the Added breakpoint is hit at all, then this would point at a scenario where you&#39;re dealing with a detached entity, such as an entity that was read from a different DB Context and being associated to another entity in the current DB Context and saved as a byproduct. When a DbContext encounters an entity that was loaded and disassociated with a different DbContext, it will treat that entity as a completely new entity and insert a new record.  The biggest single culprit for this is invariably MVC code where people pass entities to/from views. Entity references are loaded in one request, serialized to the view, and then passed back on another request. Devs assume they are receiving an entity that they can just associate to a new entity and save, but the Context of this request doesn&#39;t know about that entity, and that &quot;entity&quot; isn&#39;t actually an entity, it is now a POCO shell of data that the serializer created. It&#39;s no different to you newing up a new class and populating fields. EF won&#39;t know the difference. The result of this is you will trip the Added condition for your entity, and after completion you will have a duplicate record. (with different PK if EF is configured to treat PKs as Identity)\r\n\r\nSo an example is an Order screen: When presenting a screen to create a new order I may have loaded the Customer and passed that to the view to display customer information and will want to associate to the new order:\r\n\r\n    var customer = context.Customers.Single(x =&gt; x.CustomerId == 15);\r\n    var newOrder = new Order { Customer = customer };\r\n    return View(newOrder);\r\n\r\nThis looks innocent enough.  When we go to save the new order after setting their details:\r\n\r\n    public ActionResult Save(Order newOrder)\r\n    {\r\n       context.Orders.Add(newOrder);\r\n       newOrder.Customer.Orders.Add(newOrder);\r\n       context.SaveChanges();\r\n       // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nnewOrder had a reference to Customer #14, so all looks good. We&#39;re even associating the new order to the customer&#39;s order collection. We might even want to have updated fields on the customer record to reflect a change to the Modified date. However, newOrder in this case, and *all* associated data including .Customer are plain &#39;ol C# objects at this point. We&#39;ve added the new order to the Context, but as far as the context is concerned, the Customer referenced is *also* a new record. It will ignore the Customer ID if that is set as an Identity column and it will save a brand new Customer record (ID #15 for example) with all of the same details as Customer ID 14 and associate that to the new order. It can be subtle and easy to miss until you start querying Customers and spotting duplicate looking rows.\r\n\r\nIf you are passing entities to/from views, I&#39;d be very wary of this gotcha. Attaching and setting modified state is one option, but that involves trusting that the data has not been tampered with. As a general rule, calls to update entities should never pass entities &amp; attach them, but rather re-load those entities, validate row version, validate the data coming in, and only copy across fields you expect should ever be modified before saving the entity associated to the DbContext.\r\n\r\nHopefully that gives you a few ideas on things to check to get to the bottom of the issue.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939861/issues-with-automatically-setting-created-and-modified-date-on-each-record-in-ef/57948605#57948605","title":"Issues with Automatically setting created and modified date on each record in EF Core"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":11039549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/40rwY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"OJB1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11039549/ojb1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568701525,"post_id":57966367,"comment_id":102347190,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939861/issues-with-automatically-setting-created-and-modified-date-on-each-record-in-ef/57966367#comment102347190_57966367"},{"owner":{"reputation":4490,"user_id":10158551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/45RCc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Xing Zou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10158551/xing-zou"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":71,"user_id":11039549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/40rwY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"OJB1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11039549/ojb1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568703013,"post_id":57966367,"comment_id":102347753,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939861/issues-with-automatically-setting-created-and-modified-date-on-each-record-in-ef/57966367#comment102347753_57966367"},{"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":11039549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/40rwY.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"OJB1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11039549/ojb1"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568918839,"post_id":57966367,"comment_id":102438145,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939861/issues-with-automatically-setting-created-and-modified-date-on-each-record-in-ef/57966367#comment102438145_57966367"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4490,"user_id":10158551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/45RCc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Xing Zou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10158551/xing-zou"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4490,"user_id":10158551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/45RCc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Xing Zou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10158551/xing-zou"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568704764,"last_edit_date":1568704764,"creation_date":1568685282,"answer_id":57966367,"question_id":57939861,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57966367","body_markdown":"&gt;

UpdatedDate column will be populated with the current date/time.\r\nHowever first time I edit this same record, the UpdatedDate column is then given a new date/time value (as expected) ***BUT*** for some reason, EF Core is wiping out the value of the original CreatedDate which results in SQL assigning a default value.\r\n\r\nRequired result I need as follows:\r\n\r\nStep 1: New row created, both CreatedDate &amp; UpdatedDate column is given a date/time value (this already works)\r\nStep 2: When editing and saving an existing row, I want EF Core to update the UpdatedDate column with the updated date/time only, BUT leave the other CreatedDate column unmodified with the original creation date.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using EF Core code first, and do no want to go down the fluent API route.\r\n\r\nOne of the guides i was partially following is https://www.entityframeworktutorial.net/faq/set-created-and-modified-date-in-efcore.aspx but neither this or other solutions I&#39;ve tried is giving the result I am after.\r\n\r\nBaseclass:\r\n\r\n    public class BaseEntity\r\n    {\r\n        public DateTime?

So what I&#39;m finding is that after saving the entity, the CreatedDate column is being overwitten with a Null value, I can see this by watching the SQL explorer after a refresh. I believe the issue is along the lines of what Steve mentions below &quot;If it is #null then this might also explain the behavior in that it is not being loaded with the entity for whatever reason.&quot; \r\n\r\nBut i&#39;m a little lost in tracing where this CreatedDate value is being dropped somewhere through edit/save process. \r\n\r\nImage below shows the result at the point just before the entity is saved following an update. In the debugger I&#39;m not quite sure where to find the entry of the CreatedDate to see what value is held at this step, but it appears to be missing from the debugger list so wandering whether somehow it doesn&#39;t know about the existence of this field when saving. \r\n\r\n\r\n[![Debugging screenshot][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XFmg1.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nBelow is the method I have in my form &#39;Edit&#39; Razor page model class:\r\n\r\n     public class EditModel : PageModel\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly MyProject.Data.ApplicationDbContext _context;\r\n\r\n        public EditModel(MyProject.Data.ApplicationDbContext context)\r\n        {\r\n            _context = context;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        [BindProperty]\r\n        public RuleParameters RuleParameters { get; set; }\r\n\r\n        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnGetAsync(int? id)\r\n        {\r\n            if (id == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return NotFound();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            RuleParameters = await _context.RuleParameters\r\n                .Include(r =&gt; r.SystemMapping).FirstOrDefaultAsync(m =&gt; m.ID == id);\r\n\r\n            if (RuleParameters == null)\r\n            {\r\n                return NotFound();\r\n            }\r\n           ViewData[&quot;SystemMappingID&quot;] = new SelectList(_context.SystemMapping, &quot;ID&quot;, &quot;MappingName&quot;);\r\n            return Page();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public async Task&lt;IActionResult&gt; OnPostAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            if (!ModelState.IsValid)\r\n            {\r\n                return Page();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            _context.Attach(RuleParameters).State = EntityState.Modified;\r\n\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                await _context.SaveChangesAsync();\r\n            }\r\n            catch (DbUpdateConcurrencyException)\r\n            {\r\n                if (!RuleParametersExists(RuleParameters.ID))\r\n                {\r\n                    return NotFound();\r\n                }\r\n                else\r\n                {\r\n                    throw;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return RedirectToPage(&quot;./Index&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private bool RuleParametersExists(int id)\r\n        {\r\n            return _context.RuleParameters.Any(e =&gt; e.ID == id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nPossibly one of the reasons for this issue is the fact that I have not included the CreatedDate field in my Edit Razor Page form, so when I update the entity which in turn will run the PostAsync method server side, there is no value stored for the CreatedDate field and therefore nothing in the bag by the tine the savechangesasync method is called in my DbContext Class.

I see them in the Orders API sample request object but there&#39;s some in the Dashboard as well?\r\n\r\nWhat are the differences between orders and just the quick checkout button?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m totally lost - any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pk9j5.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939846/how-to-place-images-test-in-the-paypal-button-checkout-api","title":"How to place images &amp; test in the PayPal Button Checkout API?"},{"tags":["postgis","github-actions"],"owner":{"reputation":145,"user_id":1344295,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38e1ead1b5834e26fb681116e6b7ebf5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"anapaulagomes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1344295/anapaulagomes"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568501304,"creation_date":1568501304,"question_id":57939840,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939840","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to get Github Actions working with postgres+postgis but I couldn&#39;t get them working together yet.

objects smaller than 20 GB, whether or not you prevent CloudFront from caching them (typically by setting `Cache-Control` to any combination of `private`, `no-cache`, or `no-store` while leaving Minimum TTL set to the default value of 0 -- although there are also other ways) would have no impact on pricing, because CloudFront doesn&#39;t charge anything for cache storage.  While this might be a surprise, remember that responses are only cached in edges through which they are requested, and that CloudFront&#39;s cache is a cache, and thus ephemeral, so CloudFront can discard cached objects that don&#39;t see frequent traffic.\r\n\r\nPreventing caching doesn&#39;t bypass CloudFront, since CloudFront is the service that is processing the entire request.

Basically, wrap your code in a function and call it at the same time.

Then you can use [`import`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) instead of `require`, and you can organize your code a bit more like you would expect from Python or Java.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;.../module.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;.../src1.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;.../src2.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// module.js\r\nexport const MESSAGE = &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;\r\n```\r\n```js\r\n// src1.js (src2.js looks basically the same)\r\nimport { MESSAGE } from &quot;.../module.js&quot;;\r\nconsole.log(&quot;src1 says:&quot;, MESSAGE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, a few browsers do not support modules. To get around that, you could use a bundler (such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)) to compile your project. These also provide other features (such as code minification). But for a small project, using a bundler may not be worth the effort (though learning to use them will be helpful if you go into web development).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939812/limit-the-scope-of-contents-in-js-file/57939957#57939957","title":"limit the scope of contents in js file"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12025408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9d6e0604b7dd6c6e9d50ffdc3a98cceb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12025408/jack"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57939957,"answer_count":3,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568503001,"creation_date":1568500986,"question_id":57939812,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939812","body_markdown":"I recently encountered a situation where i have A.js, B.js and C.js .

The rendered output is as follows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;style id=&quot;styleBlock&quot;&gt;\r\n       table {border:1px solid firebrick;border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;padding:0} \r\n       thead tbody tfoot {margin:0;padding:0} \r\n       thead {border-bottom:1px solid firebrick;background-color:firebrick;color:azure} \r\n       th {border-right:1px solid firebrick;border-bottom:1px solid firebrick} \r\n       th:last-child {border-bottom:none} \r\n       tr {margin:0;border-bottom:1px solid firebrick} \r\n       tr:last-child {border-bottom:none} \r\n       tr:first-child {border-left:none} \r\n       td {margin:0;padding:10px;text-align:center;border-left:1px solid firebrick;border-right:1px solid firebrick;border-bottom:1px solid firebrick} \r\n       td:last-child {border-right:none} \r\n       tr:last-child &gt; td {border-bottom:none} \r\n       tfoot {margin:0;border-top:1px solid firebrick} \r\n    &lt;/style&gt;\r\n\r\nNote: Although the CSS is working, it is not correct; there should be a `;` at the end of the last property for each rule.

To get a better grasp of the concept, I am trying to adopt designs from my earlier project into reusable web components. I started by trying to create a Table element with some added features.\r\n\r\nFirst of, I declared a minimal template for the component:\r\n\r\n    &lt;template id=&quot;data-table-template&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;table&gt;\r\n       &lt;thead&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;\r\n       &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n       &lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt;\r\n      &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\nI use this template to create tables by taking table header values and row values as attributes. The element is used in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    &lt;eur-data-table\r\n      headers=&quot;getHeaders()&quot;,\r\n      rowdata=&quot;getRowData()&quot;\r\n      host=&quot;#data-table-host&quot;\r\n      template=&quot;#data-table-template&quot;\r\n    &gt;&lt;/eur-data-table&gt;\r\nIn the component prototype `connectedCallback` method, I add the headers, rows and set style for the component. The generated shadow DOM fragment from Chrome Element inspector is as follows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;eur-data-table headers=&quot;getHeaders()&quot; ,=&quot;&quot; rowdata=&quot;getRowData()&quot; host=&quot;#data-table-host&quot; template=&quot;#data-table-template&quot; theme=&quot;firebrick&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;table&gt;\r\n     &lt;style id=&quot;styleBlock&quot;&gt;&lt;/style&gt;\r\n     &lt;thead&gt;\r\n         &lt;th&gt;Name&lt;/th&gt;\r\n         &lt;th&gt;Age&lt;/th&gt;\r\n     &lt;/thead&gt;\r\n     &lt;tbody&gt;\r\n       &lt;tr&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;Babu&lt;/td&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;60&lt;/td&gt;\r\n       &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n       &lt;tr&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;Shyam&lt;/td&gt;\r\n         &lt;td&gt;35&lt;/td&gt;\r\n       &lt;/tr&gt;\r\n     &lt;/tbody&gt;\r\n     &lt;tfoot&gt;&lt;/tfoot&gt;\r\n    &lt;/table&gt;\r\n    &lt;/eur-data-table&gt;\r\n\r\nThe problem lies in adding style rules. In the component class, I create a `style` element and I append it to the shadow DOM before adding rules to the `style.sheet` property. I checked the console output of `style.sheet` and it looks like all the rules were added. However, after inserting the style element to the shadow DOM, there are no rules as can be seen from the rendered output above. \r\n\r\nIn the component class, style is added in the following way:\r\n\r\n    connectedCallback() {\r\n            let template = document.querySelector(DataTable._parseId(this.template));\r\n            if(!template) throw new DOMException(&#39;Host and/or template ids are undefined&#39;);\r\n            if(!this.hasAttribute(&#39;theme&#39;)) this.setAttribute(&#39;theme&#39;, &#39;firebrick&#39;);\r\n            \r\n            let style = document.createElement(&#39;style&#39;);\r\n            style.setAttribute(&#39;id&#39;, &#39;styleBlock&#39;);\r\n            // WebKit Hack\r\n            style.appendChild(document.createTextNode(&quot;&quot;));\r\n            this.shadowRoot.appendChild(style);\r\n            \r\n            this._table = template.content.cloneNode(true);\r\n            this._setupHeaders();\r\n            this._setupBody();\r\n            this._setupStyle(style.sheet); // style is not being applied!!\r\n            console.dir(style.sheet); // logs a CSSStyleSheet object\r\n            this.shadowRoot.appendChild(this._table);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the `connectedCallback` method, `_setupStyle` is passed a reference to the style sheet where, it adds the rules in the following manner (the rules are expressed as javascript object):\r\n\r\n    _setupStyle(sheet) {\r\n       if(!sheet) throw new DOMException(&#39;sheet is undefined&#39;, &#39;StylesheetNotFoundException&#39;);\r\n       let rules = window.themes[this.theme];\r\n       if(!rules) throw new DOMException(&#39;Theme is undefined&#39;);\r\n    \r\n        Object.keys(rules)\r\n           .sort((r1, r2) =&gt; rules[r1].order - rules[r2].order)\r\n           .forEach(rule =&gt; {\r\n               let o = _.omit(rules[rule], &#39;order&#39;);\r\n               let i = rule.order;\r\n               let s = this._makeRule(o, rule);\r\n               sheet.insertRule(s, i);\r\n           });    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe `order` value is an integer number used for sorting the style rules in order. Once sorted, the `order` key and its value is omitted from the object before converting it to a DOMString:\r\n\r\n    _makeRule(value, rule) {\r\n        return `${rule} ${JSON.stringify(value).replace(new RegExp(/,/g), &#39;;&#39;)}`;\r\n    }\r\nLogging the `style.sheet` property prints:\r\n\r\n    CSSStyleSheet\r\n    cssRules: CSSRuleList\r\n    0: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;tfoot&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;tfoot { }&quot;, …}\r\n    1: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;tr:last-child &gt; td&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;tr:last-child &gt; td { }&quot;, …}\r\n    2: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;td:last-child&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;td:last-child { }&quot;, …}\r\n    3: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;td&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;td { }&quot;, …}\r\n    4: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;tr:first-child&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;tr:first-child { }&quot;, …}\r\n    5: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;tr:last-child&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;tr:last-child { }&quot;, …}\r\n    6: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;tr&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;tr { }&quot;, …}\r\n    7: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;th:last-child&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;th:last-child { }&quot;, …}\r\n    8: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;th&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;th { }&quot;, …}\r\n    9: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;thead&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;thead { }&quot;, …}\r\n    10: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;thead tbody tfoot&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;thead tbody tfoot { }&quot;, …}\r\n    11: CSSStyleRule {selectorText: &quot;table&quot;, style: CSSStyleDeclaration, styleMap: StylePropertyMap, type: 1, cssText: &quot;table { }&quot;, …}\r\n\r\nMy question is: since the component gets rendered without error and since, I am adding all the rules as expected and attaching both, the style and table elements to the shadow DOM renders an element as expected then, why aren&#39;t my CSS rules being applied to the rendered content?

I&#39;ve already used IFTTT but at this point is not useful for me, i need a sampling rate of more or equal to 100 Hz and as you know this exceeds the IFTTT&#39;s usage limit. I&#39;ve tried making a RAM buffer, but i got a error saying that the buffer exceded the RAM size (4 MB) so that&#39;s why im trying to do directly.\r\n\r\nAfter trying some time i got it partially. I say &quot;partially&quot; because i have to do a random get-request after the post-request; i don&#39;t know why it works, but it works (in this way i can send data to Google Forms every second approximately, or maybe less). I guess the problem is that the esp8266 can&#39;t close the connection with Google Forms and it gets stuck when it tries to do a new post-request, if this were the problem, i don&#39;t know how to fix it in another way, any suggestions?

The reason is, that `await` waits for the returned Promise to be resolved. But constructor functions cannot return a Promise as they need to return the newly created object.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why libraries like puppeteer use factory functions like `puppeteer.launch`. These functions will create an object in addition to calling asynchronous functions afterwards. If you want to do something similar in your code, you can do it like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass Tools {\r\n  async initialize() {\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n  static async create() {\r\n    const newObject = new Tools();\r\n    await newObject.initialize();\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\nconst tools = await Tools.create();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57939745/use-puppeteer-in-class-methods/57942092#57942092","title":"Use Puppeteer in class methods"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11725421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9f5249ce96d2be5cee5984e7e48de0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KyleKluge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11725421/kylekluge"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11725421,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9f5249ce96d2be5cee5984e7e48de0a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KyleKluge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11725421/kylekluge"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57942092,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568545842,"creation_date":1568500215,"last_edit_date":1568545842,"question_id":57939745,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57939745","body_markdown":"i am asking if it is possible i could use Puppeteer in class methods.

Yet I am struggling with configuration. I am working on Visual Studio 2019, I&#39;ve succesfully downloaded SQL Server Data Tools, MS SQL Server 2017 with SSMS. Actually, everything works fine except fact that I can&#39;t create a database in Server Explorer. I am able to do that only via SQL Server Management studio. After I right click on &quot;Data Connections&quot; and then &quot;Create New SQL Server Database&quot; I can&#39;t see my server name in the place where it should be. When i type it manually, I get an error: &quot;This server version is not supported.  Only servers up to Microsoft SQL Server 2014 are supported“. What&#39;s more if I create a database in Server Management Studio I can see it in server explorer yet I can&#39;t add a new table - the right-click menu contains only &quot;refresh&quot; and &quot;properties&quot;.\r\n\r\nIt is important to mention that I tried this SQL Server Database connection like a month ago with VS 2017 before Windows reinstall, and everything worked fine. Now I tried to perform the same steps on my computer with VS 2017, VS 2019 and on my buisness laptop, both with wrong results.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also searched for the solutions here on stack and on
