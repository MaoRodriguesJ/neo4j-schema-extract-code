What I&#39;m currently working with is below: \r\n\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nnum_samples = 5\r\narray_1 = ([1,2,3])\r\narray_2 = np.zeros(num_samples)\r\narray_3 = ([])\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ndef func_add(a, b):\r\n    return a + b + 2\r\n#def func_append(c):\r\n\r\nfor j in array_1:\r\n    for i in range(num_samples):\r\n        r = np.random.randint(1,2)\r\n        array_2[i] = func_add( j, r)\r\n        c = np.mean(array_2) #this value I want to put in a new array to have an &#39;array of means&#39;\r\n        #print(b)\r\n    array_3 = np.append(array_3, c)\r\n\r\nprint(array_2)\r\nprint(np.mean(array_2))\r\nprint(c)\r\nprint(array_3)\r\n```\r\nWhich returns:\r\n```\r\n[6. 6. 6. 6. 6.]\r\n6.0\r\n6.0\r\n[4. 5. 6.]\r\n```\r\nEDIT 2: The results for array_3 seem to make sense but now I&#39;m curious as to why array_2 only contains 6&#39;s. In the first case of the loops, j = 1 and r = 1, so the function should return 4 and place that in index 1 for array_2, or do they all get overwritten by the last case of the for loop, which also would make sense I think.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think the problem is that maybe that I&#39;m pulling the value from array_1 but I want to put the mean from the processing into the first index of some array(meaning I might have to create a third array to hold those values?)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118623/using-numpy-array-as-test-cases-for-looped-monte-carlo","title":"Using numpy array as test cases for looped Monte Carlo"},{"tags":["javascript","anime.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11335,"user_id":7328218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69d338eadf83deb112f919f4c8a6052a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Taki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328218/taki"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569506993,"post_id":58118622,"comment_id":102626288,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118622/speed-up-animation-anime-js#comment102626288_58118622"},{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10859440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_M6ALB8edY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHzQ/nPjLNXwphM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amarender Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10859440/amarender-reddy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":11335,"user_id":7328218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69d338eadf83deb112f919f4c8a6052a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Taki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328218/taki"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569512690,"post_id":58118622,"comment_id":102629542,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118622/speed-up-animation-anime-js#comment102629542_58118622"},{"owner":{"reputation":11335,"user_id":7328218,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/69d338eadf83deb112f919f4c8a6052a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Taki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328218/taki"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569513295,"post_id":58118622,"comment_id":102629855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118622/speed-up-animation-anime-js#comment102629855_58118622"},{"owner":{"reputation":333,"user_id":9784568,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f0ebd1f654d7afa0c4ec98dde0a4d2a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"coolpasta","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9784568/coolpasta"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570151303,"post_id":58118622,"comment_id":102832099,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118622/speed-up-animation-anime-js#comment102832099_58118622"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10859440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_M6ALB8edY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHzQ/nPjLNXwphM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amarender Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10859440/amarender-reddy"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569506785,"creation_date":1569506785,"question_id":58118622,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58118622","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement the animation in this website(\r\n\r\n    var timeline = anime.timeline({ autoplay: true, direction: &#39;alternate&#39;, loop: true });\r\n\r\n    https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/VWJRav?editors=1100\r\n\r\n) in my angular7 app. Everything was fine, but the animation is playing too slow.

Concurrency isn&#39;t asynchrony. Running multiple slow queries in parallel won&#39;t make them run faster, quite the opposite. These are different problems and require very different solutions. Without a specific problem one can only give generic advice. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Parallelism - processing an 800K item array**\r\n\r\nParallelism means processing a ton of data using multiple cores in parallel. To do that, you need to partition your data and feed each partition to a &quot;worker&quot; for processing. You need to minimize communication between workers and the need of synchronization to get the best performance, otherwise your workers will spend CPU time doing nothing. That means, no global queue updating.\r\n\r\nIf you have a lot of lines, or if line processing is CPU-bound, you can use PLINQ to process it :\r\n\r\n    var query = from y in lines.AsParallel()\r\n                from t in GetTasks(y.LineCode)\r\n                select t;\r\n\r\n    var theResults=query.ToList();\r\n\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s it. No need to synchronize access to a queue, either through locking or using a concurrent collection. This will use all available cores though. You can add `WithDegreeOfParallelism()` to reduce the number of cores used to avoid freezing \r\n\r\n**Concurrency - calling 2000 servers**\r\n\r\n*Concurrency* on the other hand means doing several different things at the same time. No partitioning is involved.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I had to query 8 or 2000 servers for monitoring data (true story) I wouldn&#39;t use `Parallel` or PLINQ. For one thing, `Parallel` and PLINQ use all available cores. In this case though they won&#39;t be doing anything, they&#39;ll just wait for responses. Parallelism classes can&#39;t handle async methods either because there&#39;s no point - they aren&#39;t meant to *wait* for responses.\r\n\r\nA very quick &amp; dirty solution would be to start multiple tasks and wait for them to return, eg :\r\n\r\n    var tasks=lines.Select(y=&gt;Task.Run(()=&gt;GetTasks(y.LineCode));\r\n    //Array of individual results\r\n    var resultsArray=await Task.WhenAll(tasks);\r\n\r\n    //flatten the results\r\n    var resultList=resultsArray.SelectMany(r=&gt;r).ToList();\r\n\r\nThis will start all requests at once. Network Security didn&#39;t like the 2000 concurrent requests, since it looked like a hack attack and caused a bit of network flooding. \r\n\r\n**Concurrency with Dataflow**\r\n\r\nWe can use the TPL Dataflow library and eg ActionBlock or TransformBlock to make the requests with a controlled degree of parallelism :\r\n\r\n    var options=new ExecutionDataflowBlockOptions { \r\n                        MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 4 ,\r\n                        BoundedCapacity=10,\r\n                };\r\n    var spamBlock=new TransformManyBlock&lt;Line,Result&gt;(\r\n                                   y=&gt;GetTasks(y.LineCode),\r\n                                   options);\r\n    var outputBlock=new BufferBlock&lt;Result&gt;();\r\n    spamBlock.LinkTo(outputBlock);\r\n\r\n    foreach(var line in lines)\r\n    {\r\n        await spamBlock.SendAsync(line);\r\n    }\r\n    spamBlock.Complete();\r\n    //Wait for all 4 workers to finish\r\n    await spamBlock.Completion;\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce the `spamBlock` completes, the results can be found in `outputBlock`. By setting a `BoundedCapacity` I ensure that the posting loop will wait if there are too many unprocessed messages in `spamBlock`&#39;s input queue. \r\n\r\nAn `ActionBlock` can handle asynchronous methods too. Assuming `GetTasksAsync` returns a `Task&lt;Result[]&gt;` we can use: \r\n\r\n    var spamBlock=new TransformManyBlock&lt;Line,Result&gt;(\r\n                                   y=&gt;GetTasksAsync(y.LineCode),\r\n                                   options);\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118593/parallel-for-each-or-any-alternative-for-parallel-loop/58120259#58120259","title":"Parallel for each or any alternative for parallel loop?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6726,"user_id":196526,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0woAd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bastien Vandamme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/196526/bastien-vandamme"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6591,"user_id":1364007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d106de3dec9586b56ed7f110497689e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Wai Ha Lee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1364007/wai-ha-lee"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569512044,"creation_date":1569506690,"last_edit_date":1569508978,"question_id":58118593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58118593","body_markdown":"I have this code\r\n\r\n```\r\nLines.ToList().ForEach(y =&gt;\r\n{\r\n    globalQueue.AddRange(GetTasks(y.LineCode).ToList());\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for each line in my list of lines I get the tasks that I add to a global production queue.

To wit, I&#39;ve been using this code with great success in production ever since.  The values I work with are almost exclusively string data and by chance, any non-string data happens to be aliased because it&#39;s usually re-used service Port numbers.\r\n\r\nBased on these successes and not critically reading the code (I wholly trust the author to know ruamel.yaml far better than me), I incorrectly believed this code was updating **only** the target node and any references to **it**.  As such, I also thought it was safe to use this code for updating non-aliased data, too.  I was mistaken.  This is my fault.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, *whenever a non-String value is passed for update to this function, it replaces not only that target node but **every** node with the same value even though they are not references to each other*.  So, when the data looks like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n---\r\nkey: 42\r\nother_key: 42\r\n```\r\n\r\nA call into the function to change `key: 42` to `key: 5280` not only makes the expected change, but also changes `other_key:` to `5280`.  This **does *not* occur** when the value being changed is non-aliased string data, no matter how many other nodes have the same value (which is what led me to believe it was safe to use this function to update *any* value, aliased or not).  This **does** also occur when the values are Boolean.\r\n\r\nI didn&#39;t understand what the code was actually doing.  I used the code in a way it was not designed for.\r\n\r\n*What I need is the function to accept a node for change, then change only **that** node when it is a non-aliased value **and** when it **is** an aliased value, also change all other so-aliased nodes **without** affecting other nodes which are unrelated aliases (\\*alias1 versus \\*alias2) with the same value or which are non-aliased values that happen to be the same as the alias being updated.*  When I invoke the function, I only have the whole of the data, the target node, and the expected new value for it.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m open to refactoring my own code if the function needs more information at invocation.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118589/ruamel-yaml-recurse-function-unexpectedly-updates-every-instance-of-non-string","title":"ruamel.yaml recurse function: Unexpectedly Updates Every Instance of Non-String Data with the Same Value"},{"tags":["wordpress","woocommerce"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1083,"user_id":9129697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85b34405dd2477723f50c548672e20df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"developerme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9129697/developerme"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569563121,"post_id":58118961,"comment_id":102644218,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118588/how-to-display-product-price-on-custom-meta-filed-woocommerce/58118961#comment102644218_58118961"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":7779131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65c1dac2db021472f28b98edb0d275aa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Asad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7779131/asad"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569507847,"creation_date":1569507847,"answer_id":58118961,"question_id":58118588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58118961","body_markdown":"To get Product price without woocommerce hook\r\ndefine product as global\r\nglobal $product;\r\nand then get product price\r\n \r\n\r\n    $product-&gt;get_price();\r\n    \r\n    add_action(&#39;woocommerce_before_add_to_cart_button&#39;, &#39;my_custom_checkout_field&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    function my_custom_checkout_field() {\r\n       global $product;\r\n       $price = $product-&gt;get_price();\r\n    \r\n        echo &quot;test&quot;;\r\n        echo &#39;&lt;div id=&quot;my_custom_checkout_field&quot;&gt;&#39;;\r\n    \r\n        echo  &#39; &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;my_field_name&quot; value=&quot;.$price.&quot;&gt;&#39;;\r\n        echo &#39;&lt;/div&gt;&#39;;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118588/how-to-display-product-price-on-custom-meta-filed-woocommerce/58118961#58118961","title":"How to display product price on custom meta filed woocommerce?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1083,"user_id":9129697,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85b34405dd2477723f50c548672e20df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"developerme","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9129697/developerme"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569507847,"creation_date":1569506677,"question_id":58118588,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58118588","body_markdown":"I want to display product price on single page custom field.

When your code calls `tcsetattr`, most of the `options` variable will be set to random bits, so `tcsetattr` is likely to either return an error or apply bogus settings to the terminal.\r\n\r\nSince your code only modifies certain terminal settings explicitly, the best way to initialize the `options` variable would be to read the old settings into it using a call to `tcgetattr`:\r\n\r\n        ret = tcgetattr(fd, &amp;options);\r\n        if (ret &lt; 0) {\r\n            perror(&quot;tcgetattr&quot;);\r\n            exit(1);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        options.c_lflag &amp;= ~ICANON;\r\n\r\n        options.c_cc[VMIN] = 2;\r\n        options.c_cc[VTIME] = 0;\r\n\r\n        ret = tcsetattr(fd, TCSANOW, &amp;options);\r\n        if (ret &lt; 0) {\r\n            perror(&quot;tcsetattr&quot;);\r\n            exit(1);\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe code sample above assumes that the file descriptor `fd` is linked to a terminal, so that `isatty(fd)` returns 1. It does not apply at all when `fd` is linked to an ordinary file.\r\n\r\nIn your posted code, `fd` is linked to a file called &quot;sample.txt&quot; in the current directory, which is unlikely to be a terminal.  In that case, the `tcgetattr` and `tcsetattr` calls will return `-1` and set `errno` to `ENOTTY`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118569/cant-set-file-descriptor-to-blocking-mode/58119605#58119605","title":"Can&#39;t set file descriptor to blocking mode"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":9756886,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7c86e5e4747e6878c732ab1211dc6b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C.

my BigQuery project I store event data integrated from Firebase. The granularity and dimension is such that trying to present raw data in Data Studio quickly makes the report become VERY slow (1-2 min per page/interaction).\r\n\r\nI then started to think how I could create pre-aggregated tables in BigQuery to speed everything up, but quickly realised COUNT DISTINCT metrics would be a problem with this approach.\r\nLet me explain:\r\n```\r\nSELECT user, date\r\nFROM UNNEST([\r\n  STRUCT(&quot;Adam&quot; AS user, &quot;20190923&quot; AS date),\r\n  (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;20190923&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Carl&quot;, &quot;20190923&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;20190924&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;20190924&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Adam&quot;, &quot;20190925&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Carl&quot;, &quot;20190925&quot;),\r\n  (&quot;Bob&quot;, &quot;20190926&quot;)\r\n]) AS website_visits;\r\n\r\n+------+----------+\r\n| User |   Date   |\r\n+------+----------+\r\n| Adam | 20190923 |\r\n| Bob  | 20190923 |\r\n| Carl | 20190923 |\r\n| Adam | 20190924 |\r\n| Bob  | 20190924 |\r\n| Adam | 20190925 |\r\n| Carl | 20190925 |\r\n| Bob  | 20190926 |\r\n+------+----------+\r\n```\r\nThe above is a table of website visits.\r\n\r\nClearly, creating a pre-aggregated table like\r\n```\r\nSELECT date, COUNT(DISTINCT user) FROM website_visits GROUP BY date\r\n```\r\nhas the limitation that the count cannot be aggregated further (or even less, dinamically) to get a total, as doing a SUM would return 8 unique users which is not correct, there are only 3 unique users.\r\n\r\nIn BigQuery, this is fixed by using HLL_COUNT, which despite the approximation works ok for me.\r\n\r\nNow to the big question:\r\n\r\n**How to do the same so that the result is displayable in Data Studio????**\r\n\r\nHLL_COUNT.EXTRACT is not available as function in there, and in the reporting I always have to keep in mind that the date range is set by the user however (s)he likes so it&#39;s not possible to *store* a pre-aggregated result for ALL cases...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT 1: APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT**\r\n\r\nAs per answer from Bobbylank, I tried to use APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT.\r\nHowever I found that this just seems to move the issue down the line. My fault for not explaining what&#39;s over there.\r\nDespite being performances acceptable it does not seem possible to me to blend a data source with this calculated metric.\r\n\r\nExample: After displaying the amount of unique users in the selected period (**which now works**), I&#39;m also trying to display Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) in Data Studio like Firebase does.\r\n\r\nTo do this, I have to **SUM(REVENUE) / APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT(USER)**\r\n\r\nClearly, REVENUE works ok with pre-aggregation and is available in the raw data. I tried then to blend the raw data with a table containing just user visits. However APPROX_COUNT_DISTINCT can&#39;t be used in the blended data definition as calculated metrics are not allowed.\r\n\r\nEven trying to use the USER field as a metric with Count Distinct aggregation, despite returning the correct figures when showing revenue and user count separately, when I try to divide them the problem becomes aggregation (apply SUM or AVG to the field and basically the result will be AVG(REVENUE/USERS) for each day).\r\n\r\nI also then tried to store REVENUE directly in the visits table, but was reminded by Data Studio that I can&#39;t create calculated metrics that I can&#39;t mix dimensions and metrics in a calculated field.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118567/bigquery-to-data-studio-show-reliable-count-distinct-regardless-of-the-selecte","title":"BigQuery to Data Studio : Show reliable COUNT DISTINCT regardless of the selected period"},{"tags":["javascript","react-native"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4100,"user_id":1650337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOwgU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DBS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1650337/dbs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569506721,"post_id":58118565,"comment_id":102626111,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118565/show-texts-during-a-loading#comment102626111_58118565"},{"owner":{"reputation":182,"user_id":11604252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb643e8a0029140a5790891e0add29ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11604252/jack23"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":4100,"user_id":1650337,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xOwgU.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DBS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1650337/dbs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569506860,"post_id":58118565,"comment_id":102626197,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118565/show-texts-during-a-loading#comment102626197_58118565"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":182,"user_id":11604252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb643e8a0029140a5790891e0add29ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11604252/jack23"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569512190,"post_id":58119797,"comment_id":102629321,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118565/show-texts-during-a-loading/58119797#comment102629321_58119797"},{"owner":{"reputation":5191,"user_id":11212074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tCVnpOeR1Eo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd3LNc1AtDnXpnyzis3jpCUtDmCXA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"hong develop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11212074/hong-develop"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":182,"user_id":11604252,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fb643e8a0029140a5790891e0add29ec?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack23","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11604252/jack23"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569512281,"post_id":58119797,"comment_id":102629379,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118565/show-texts-during-a-loading/58119797#comment102629379_58119797"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5191,"user_id":11212074,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-tCVnpOeR1Eo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd3LNc1AtDnXpnyzis3jpCUtDmCXA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"hong develop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11212074/hong-develop"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569510542,"creation_date":1569510542,"answer_id":58119797,"question_id":58118565,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58119797","body_markdown":"What you want is to show `indicator` and `text1` during loading time and then `text2` and `text3`.

The solution was pretty good, because if the contact came from (for example) the Google account, it will stay the exact same ID on every device I&#39;ll have. The problem is - **not every contact has a SOURCE_ID**.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nIt is also possible to query a specific contact using it&#39;s data as filters, which may work as a unique ID, such as his phone number, etc... However every piece of data has a flaw. For example: A contact may have multiple phone numbers (which is still ok) and the numbers can be varied (for example: 202-555-0105 is the same as +1-202-555-0105 which is also the same as (202) 555 0105 and also 2025550105).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nSo after given the problem -&lt;br&gt;\r\n**How can I get a unique ID for the contacts in the Android phonebook so they&#39;ll be the same cross-device?**&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n\r\nNote: It&#39;s possible on IOS by default (see [documentation][4]) -\r\n\r\n&gt; Contacts in different accounts that represent the same person may be automatically linked together. Linked contacts are displayed in OS X and iOS apps as unified contacts. A unified contact is an in-memory, temporary view of the set of linked contacts that are merged into one contact.\r\n\r\n&gt; By default the Contacts framework returns unified contacts. Each fetched unified contact (CNContact) object has its own unique identifier that is different from any individual contact’s identifier in the set of linked contacts. A refetch of a unified contact should be done with its identifier.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/ContactsContract.RawContactsColumns.html#CONTACT_ID\r\n

way I have done this in the past is to create semaphore to flag when an async function has already been called and is waiting execution on the event loop.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple example for requestAnimationFrame\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport raf from &#39;raf&#39;\r\nimport State from &#39;./state&#39;\r\n\r\nlet rafID\r\n\r\nfunction delayedNotify () {\r\n  rafID = null\r\n  State.notify()\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default function rafUpdateBatcher () {\r\n  if (rafID) return // prevent multiple request animation frame callbacks\r\n  rafID = raf(delayedNotify)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case once you call the function, all future calls will be ignored until the first one is executed. Think of it as an async throttle function\r\n\r\nFor more complex scenarios then another solution might be this

what I gather from reading your comments, if action A triggered action B asynchronously, you want to be able to tell where action A was done (in general, not just in a mutation observer). I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any trick built into JavaScript to do this like it seems you&#39;re looking for, however, if you know exactly how your JavaScript works, you can track this information. Job queues in JavaScript are FIFO by definition, the event loop queue also works this way. That means you can store information corresponding to a specific event in an array at the same time you&#39;re doing the action which triggers the event, and be confident that they&#39;re getting processed in the same order as the array. Here&#39;s an example with your mutation observer.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const\r\n        foo = document.getElementById(&#39;foo&#39;),\r\n        mutationQueue = [];\r\n\r\n    function handler(){\r\n        console.log(&#39;handler&#39;);\r\n        \r\n        const isHandling = mutationQueue.shift();\r\n        if(isHandling){\r\n            console.log(&#39;Re-entry!&#39;);\r\n            //  Throttle/debounce and completely different handling logic\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        setTimeout(()=&gt; {\r\n            foo.setAttribute(&#39;class&#39;,&#39;bar&#39;);\r\n            foo.setAttribute(&#39;class&#39;,&#39;&#39;);\r\n            mutationQueue.push(true);\r\n        }, 1000 * Math.random());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    mutationObserver=new MutationObserver(handler);\r\n    mutationObserver.observe(foo, {\r\n        attributes:true,\r\n        characterData:true,\r\n        childList:true,\r\n        subtree:true\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    function randomIntervals() {\r\n        setTimeout(()=&gt;{\r\n            foo.setAttribute(&#39;class&#39;,&#39;bar&#39;);\r\n            foo.setAttribute(&#39;class&#39;,&#39;&#39;);\r\n            mutationQueue.push(false);\r\n            randomIntervals();\r\n        }, 1000 * Math.random())\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    randomIntervals();\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&#39;foo&#39;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nYou have to make sure you add the appropriate value to the array at **every** point in your code that is going to trigger your async handler, or the entire thing will be messed up. I&#39;ve never done this myself, I just thought of it for this question, but it seems pretty easy to do wrong. However, I fear this may be the only way to do what you want in general.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118551/check-for-async-function-re-entry-in-js/58249990#58249990","title":"Check for async function re-entry in JS"}],"owner":{"reputation":878,"user_id":1710180,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecc645c00211cc2d344fdd9f9917646d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dinu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1710180/dinu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":878,"user_id":1710180,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ecc645c00211cc2d344fdd9f9917646d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dinu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1710180/dinu"},"comment_count":12,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":183,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"answer_count":3,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1570300710,"creation_date":1569506539,"last_edit_date":1570300710,"question_id":58118551,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58118551","body_markdown":"Scenario:\r\n\r\nWe have a `MutationObserver` handler function `handler`.\r\n\r\nIn `handler`, we do some DOM manipulation that would trigger `handler` again. Conceptually, we would have a reentrant `handler` call. Except `MutationObserver` doesn&#39;t run in-thread, it will fire after the `handler` has already finished execution.\r\n\r\nSo, `handler` will trigger itself, but through the async queue, not in-thread. The JS debugger seems to know this, it will have itself as an async ancestor in the call stack (i.e. using Chrome).\r\n\r\nIn order to implement some efficient debouncing of events, we need to detect same; that is, if `handler` was called as a result of changes triggered by itself.\r\n\r\nSo how to do?\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    mutationObserver=new MutationObserver(handler);\r\n    mutationObserver.observe(window.document,{\r\n        attributes:true,\r\n        characterData:true,\r\n        childList:true,\r\n        subtree:true\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    var isHandling;\r\n    function handler(){\r\n        console.log(&#39;handler&#39;);\r\n\r\n        //  The test below won&#39;t work, as the re-entrant call \r\n        //  is placed out-of-sync, after isHandling has been reset\r\n        if(isHandling){\r\n            console.log(&#39;Re-entry!&#39;);\r\n            //  Throttle/debounce and completely different handling logic\r\n            return;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        isHandling=true;\r\n        \r\n        //  Trigger a MutationObserver change\r\n        setTimeout(function(){\r\n            // The below condition should not be here, I added it just to not clog the \r\n            // console by avoiding first-level recursion: if we always set class=bar,\r\n            // handler will trigger itself right here indefinitely.

And an **overlay**, which is the component observing the **content** for changes and possibly doing changes of its own.\r\n\r\nA simple idea that is not enough is to just disable the `MutationObserver` while handling; or, assume every second call to `handler` as recursive; This does not work in the case illustrated above with the `animationend` event: the **contents** can have handlers which in turn can trigger async operations. The two most popular such issues are: `onanimationend`/`oneventend`, `onscroll`.\r\n\r\nSo the idea of detecting just direct (first-call) recursion is not enough, we need quite literally the equivalent of the call stack view in the debugger: a way to tell if a call (no matter how many async calls later) is a descendant of itself.\r\n\r\nThus, this question is not limited to just `MutationObserver`, as it necessarily involves a generic way to detect async calls descendent of themselves in the call tree. You can replace `MutationObserver` with any async event, really.\r\n\r\nExplanation of the example above: in the example, the mutationobserver is triggering the `bar` animation on `#foo` whenever `#foo` is not `.bar`. However, the **contents** has an `transitionend` handler that sets `#foo` to `.bar-final` which triggers a vicious self-recursion chain. We would like to discard reacting to the `#foo.bar-final` change, by detecting that it&#39;s a consequence of our own action (starting the animation with `#foo.bar`).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118551/check-for-async-function-re-entry-in-js","title":"Check for async function re-entry in JS"},{"tags":["javascript","arrays","object","javascript-objects","clone"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17611,"user_id":3783478,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fMtGE.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rajesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3783478/rajesh"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569506640,"post_id":58118550,"comment_id":102626057,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118550/from-an-array-of-objects-extract-selected-objects-and-create-new-array#comment102626057_58118550"},{"owner":{"reputation":22892,"user_id":1291492,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f914cd02166793195d9d950503f8f739?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ControlAltDel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1291492/controlaltdel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569506868,"post_id":58118550,"comment_id":102626204,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118550/from-an-array-of-objects-extract-selected-objects-and-create-new-array#comment102626204_58118550"},{"owner":{"reputation":3356,"user_id":10445697,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-RFNqiVO6PKc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXfAZXncU5HAWwYCWOT9vsRAHM5hw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kobe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10445697/kobe"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569508004,"post_id":58118550,"comment_id":102626938,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118550/from-an-array-of-objects-extract-selected-objects-and-create-new-array#comment102626938_58118550"},{"owner":{"reputation":3267,"user_id":217867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/IQpud.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lonnie Best","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/217867/lonnie-best"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569512973,"post_id":58118550,"comment_id":102629685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118550/from-an-array-of-objects-extract-selected-objects-and-create-new-array#comment102629685_58118550"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":7447227,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d1-2P5kVs9A/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABKU/IhX33ZmeII4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Misol Goh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7447227/misol-goh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569507235,"creation_date":1569507235,"answer_id":58118766,"question_id":58118550,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58118766","body_markdown":"I would like to recommend to use `reduce`.\r\n\r\n    const {\r\n      firstArrayFromMyArray,\r\n      secondArrayFromMyArray,\r\n      thirdArrayFromMyArray,\r\n    } = myArray.reduce((acc, ele, index) =&gt;

We are aware of the obvious changes in Android Q regarding the DATA fields and the scoped storage. However, we experience some weird issues on our Pixel 2 for queries, that use more complex expressions in the SQL projection. For example we do something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nfinal String[] projection = {MediaStore.MediaColumns._ID,\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA,\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.MIME_TYPE,\r\n                                     getDateColumn(target, sortMode),\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.TITLE,\r\n                                     &quot;rtrim(&quot; + MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA + &quot;, replace(&quot; +\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA + &quot;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;&#39;)) as &quot; + COLUMN_DIRECTORY,\r\n                                     &quot;substr(&quot; + MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA + &quot;, &quot; + &quot;length(rtrim(&quot; +\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA + &quot;, replace(&quot; + MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATA +\r\n                                     &quot;, &#39;/&#39;, &#39;&#39;)) )&quot; + &quot;)&quot; + &quot;as &quot; + COLUMN_FILENAME,\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.DISPLAY_NAME,\r\n                                     MediaStore.MediaColumns.DATE_ADDED};\r\n```\r\nWhich used to work absolutely fine up until now. On the latest Android Q version however, we get the following exception for every query that uses projections that are not the pure column names:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019-09-26 15:54:56.733 30276-30659/?

Including the menus inside `sidebarMenu` allows the `tabItems` to track the `menuItems`, but also breaks the reactivity, i.e., when `input$tabs == &#39;uci_iden&#39;` the additional menus disappear (because `input$tabs != &#39;identificacion&#39;`). \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nOne way to achieve the behavior you want (possibly not the best way) is to render the additional menus through the `server` using `renderUI`. Note that we still have to include the additional menus inside `sidebarMenu` and monitor them through `input$tabs`. To make sure they stick around when `input$tabs != &#39;identificacion&#39;`, we can include their `id`s in the condition. When neither of `identification`, `uni_iden` or `admision_iden` are selected, we render an empty `div`.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n[![enter image description

part2.First(x =&gt; x.EnterPrice == closestVal); // assumes there is an answer\r\n\r\nThere is of course much room for refinements and improvements in the above; I&#39;ve focused on clarity and brevity. The key is that you can swap out the implementation of `NullChairCount` if and when your data model changes, since it&#39;s the core data model projection that enables the rest of the query logic to work.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118443/order-by-query-of-columns-that-are-not-null-in-a-database/58118964#58118964","title":"Order by query of columns that are not null in a

trying to do a sql query ( using Entity Framework or Linq )\r\nAnd that&#39;s the details:\r\n\r\nI have an **ApplicationUser** entity, and its important properties are:\r\n\r\n&gt; Money\r\n\r\nAnd I also have **Room** entity, which has:\r\n\r\n&gt; EnterPrice : Int\r\n\r\n&gt; Chair0 : ApplicationUser\r\n\r\n&gt; Chair1 : ApplicationUser\r\n\r\n&gt; Chair2 : ApplicationUser\r\n\r\n&gt; Chair3 : ApplicationUser\r\n\r\n&gt; Chair4 : ApplicationUser\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m trying to write a bit complicated query, and I managed to split it logically to 3 parts:\r\n\r\n**Part 1)**\r\n\r\nAll the results that The CurrentUser has enough money to EnterPrice, and this is the easy part as I did here:\r\n\r\n    var result = db.Rooms.Where(x =&gt; x.EnterPrice &lt; user.Chips)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Part 2)**\r\n\r\n\r\nbut now, I want to sort by Chairs that are not null ( by their count ), so for example If I have these Rooms:\r\n\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n    | Room Name | EnterPrice |    Chair0    |    Chair1    |    Chair2    |    Chair3    | Chair4 |\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n    |   Room1   |    10000   |     NULL     | *SomeUserID* |     NULL     | *SomeUserID* |  NULL  |\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n    |   Room2   |    8000    | *SomeUserID* | *SomeUserID* | *SomeUserID* |     NULL     |  NULL  |\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n    |   Room3   |    12000   |     NULL     | *SomeUserID* |     NULL     |     NULL     |  NULL  |\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n    |   Room4   |    13000   | *SomeUserID* |     NULL     | *SomeUserID* | *SomeUserID* |  NULL  |\r\n    +-----------+------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+--------+\r\n\r\nSo the result should be (ascent):\r\n\r\n    Room2\r\n    Room4\r\n    Room1\r\n    Room3\r\n\r\nNote: And also the following restriction: not showing rooms that are full, so in that case full means all Chairs are occupied.\r\n\r\nNow I tried to program this part of the query, and I thought about something like that:\r\n\r\n    result = result.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Chair0 != null);\r\n    result = result.OrderBy(x =&gt; x.Chair1 != null);\r\n    ..\r\n    \r\n    and so on\r\n\r\nbut I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the best way to do that, and also I don&#39;t know how to remove full rooms from the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Part 3)**\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then, a Secondary sorting will be by the average **EnterPrice**, so for example Room2 and Room4 have the same Players count, so the 2nd sort will choose Room4 since it&#39;s closer to the average EnterPrice which is:\r\n\r\n(10000 + 8000 + 12000 + 13000) / 4 = 10750\r\n\r\nIt will choose Room4 since:\r\n\r\nRoom4 : |10750 - 13000| = 2250\r\nRoom2 : |10750 - 8000| = 2750\r\n\r\nSo Room4 is closer to the avg.\r\n\r\nNow I have no clue how even to start writing Part 3 of the query.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58118443/order-by-query-of-columns-that-are-not-null-in-a-database","title":"Order by query of columns that are not null in a

The reason for that is to avoid unnecessary long paths in stack traces and to hide potentially confusing folder structure/names, because all unhandled exceptions are reported to a server (as part of anonymous error reporting system).\r\n\r\nI found [this article][1] where the proposed solution is to use `&lt;PathMap&gt;` in the `.csproj` file like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;AppOutputBase&gt;$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)\\&lt;/AppOutputBase&gt;\r\n    &lt;PathMap&gt;$(AppOutputBase)=X:\\test\\&lt;/PathMap&gt;\r\n\r\nAs pointed out in the article...\r\n\r\n&gt; Building the application again, now the paths are changed to X:\\test. That also means, when the exception is thrown and i.e. logged, the exception will have new paths in stack trace.\r\n\r\n    Unhandled Exception: System.InvalidOperationException: Operation is not valid due to the current \r\n    state of the object.   \r\n    at ConsoleApp1.Program.Main(String[] args) in X:\\test\\Program.cs:line 9\r\n\r\n...this works great. \r\n\r\nHowever, I have concerns that there are potential issues when just changing `MSBuildProjectDirectory`.

your posted order-by clause you&#39;re converting the date to a string using the model `&#39;yyyymmddhhmmss&#39;`. That is using the month twice - it should be `&#39;yyyymmddhhmiss&#39;` (`mi` for minutes, not `mm`, which is month); or preferably `&#39;yyyymmddhh24miss&#39;` to avoid AM/PM confusion. (There is no reason to convert to a string for ordering here, but I think you only did it to investigate why it appeared wrong with a plain date...)\r\n\r\nAs the output you have shown doesn&#39;t match your stated NLS settings you must be converting the result of the query to a string elsewhere.
