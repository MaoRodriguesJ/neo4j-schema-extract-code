Now the metrics available in prometheus are available to Kubernetes.\r\n\r\nYou can now define a `HorizontalPodAutoscaler` for your application:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nkind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\r\napiVersion: autoscaling/v2alpha1\r\nmetadata:\r\nname: sample-metrics-app-hpa\r\nspec:\r\n    scaleTargetRef:\r\n        kind: Deployment\r\n        name: sample-metrics-app\r\n    minReplicas: 2\r\n    maxReplicas: 10\r\n    metrics:\r\n    - type: Object\r\n    object:\r\n        target:\r\n        kind: Service\r\n        name: sample-metrics-app\r\n        metricName: celery_queue_length\r\n        targetValue: 100\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/directxman12/k8s-prometheus-adapter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058192/how-to-auto-scale-kubernetes-pods-based-on-number-of-tasks-in-celery-task-queue/58058488#58058488","title":"How to auto-scale Kubernetes Pods based on number of tasks in celery task queue?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3063,"user_id":4747193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBKGw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weibeld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4747193/weibeld"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3063,"user_id":4747193,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBKGw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"weibeld","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4747193/weibeld"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569237937,"last_edit_date":1569237937,"creation_date":1569233144,"answer_id":58060009,"question_id":58058192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58060009","body_markdown":"Yes, by using the Kubernetes metrics registry and [Horizontal Pod Autoscaler](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/).\r\n\r\n**First, you need to collect the &quot;queue length&quot; metric from Celery and expose it through one of the Kubernetes metric APIs. You can do this with a Prometheus-based pipeline:**\r\n\r\n1. Since Celery doesn&#39;t expose Prometheus metrics, you need to install an exporter that exposes some information about Celery (including the queue length) as Prometheus metrics. For example, [this exporter](https://github.com/zerok/celery-prometheus-exporter).\r\n1. Install [Prometheus][1] in your cluster and configure it to collect the metric corresponding to the task queue length from the Celery exporter.\r\n2. Install the [Prometheus Adapter][2] in your cluster and configure it to expose the &quot;queue length&quot; metric through the [Custom Metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md) by pulling its value from Prometheus.\r\n\r\n**Now you can configure the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler to query this metric from the Custom Metrics API and autoscale your app based on it.**\r\n\r\nFor example, to scale the app between 1 and 10 replicas based on a target value for the queue length of 5:\r\n\r\n    apiVersion: autoscaling/v2beta2\r\n    kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler\r\n    metadata:\r\n      name: myapp-hpa\r\n    spec:\r\n      scaleTargetRef:\r\n        apiVersion: apps/v1\r\n        kind: Deployment\r\n        name: myapp\r\n      minReplicas: 1\r\n      maxReplicas: 10\r\n      metrics:\r\n        - type: Object\r\n          object:\r\n            metric:\r\n              name: mycelery_queue_length\r\n            target:\r\n              type: value\r\n              value: 5\r\n            describedObject:\r\n              apiVersion: apps/v1\r\n              kind: Deployment\r\n              name: mycelery\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://prometheus.io/\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/DirectXMan12/k8s-prometheus-adapter","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058192/how-to-auto-scale-kubernetes-pods-based-on-number-of-tasks-in-celery-task-queue/58060009#58060009","title":"How to auto-scale Kubernetes Pods based on number of tasks in celery task queue?"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7307007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/217bf26b04a78b8e20002ac116159748?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gullible Worm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7307007/gullible-worm"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569237937,"creation_date":1569226384,"question_id":58058192,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58058192","body_markdown":"I have a celery worker deployed on Kubernetes pods which executes a task (not very CPU intensive but takes some time to complete due to some HTTP calls).

Let&#39;s use Beam&#39;s `KV`, which defines a key-value pair. In the following snippet, we&#39;re extracting the values from the `TableRow`, and concatenating the string you want:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrowsFromBigQuery\r\n            .apply(\r\n                MapElements.into(TypeDescriptors.kvs(TypeDescriptors.strings()\r\n                                                     TypeDescriptors.integers()))\r\n                    .via(tableRow -&gt; KV.of(\r\n                               (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey1&quot;)\r\n                               + (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey2&quot;)\r\n                               + (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey3&quot;),\r\n                               (Integer) tableRow.get(&quot;myIntegerField&quot;))))\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, to write to Spanner, we use `Mutation`-type objects, which define the kind of mutation that we want to apply to a row in Spanner. We&#39;ll do it with another `MapElements` transform, which takes N inputs, and returns N outputs. We define the *insert or update* mutations there:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmyKvPairsPCollection\r\n            .apply(\r\n                MapElements.into(TypeDescriptor.of(Mutation.class))\r\n                    .via(elm -&gt; Mutation.newInsertOrUpdateBuilder(&quot;myTableName)\r\n                                    .set(&quot;key&quot;).to(elm.getKey())\r\n                                    .set(&quot;value&quot;).to(elm.getValue()));\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you can pass the output to that to `SpannerIO.write`. The whole pipeline looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n        Pipeline p = Pipeline.create(options);\r\n\r\n        String tableSpec = &quot;database.mytable&quot;;\r\n\r\n        // read whole table from bigquery\r\n        PCollection&lt;TableRow&gt; rowsFromBigQuery =\r\n            p.apply(\r\n                BigQueryIO.readTableRows().from(tableSpec));\r\n\r\n        // Take in a TableRow, and convert it into a key-value pair\r\n        PCollection&lt;Mutation&gt; mutations = rowsFromBigQuery\r\n            // First we make the TableRows into the appropriate key-value\r\n            // pair of string key and integer.\r\n            .apply(\r\n                MapElements.into(TypeDescriptors.kvs(TypeDescriptors.strings()\r\n                                                     TypeDescriptors.integers()))\r\n                    .via(tableRow -&gt; KV.of(\r\n                               (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey1&quot;)\r\n                               + (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey2&quot;)\r\n                               + (String) tableRow.get(&quot;myKey3&quot;),\r\n                               (Integer) tableRow.get(&quot;myIntegerField&quot;))))\r\n            // Now we construct the mutations\r\n            .apply(\r\n                MapElements.into(TypeDescriptor.of(Mutation.class))\r\n                    .via(elm -&gt; Mutation.newInsertOrUpdateBuilder(&quot;myTableName)\r\n                                    .set(&quot;key&quot;).to(elm.getKey())\r\n                                    .set(&quot;value&quot;).to(elm.getValue()));\r\n\r\n        // Now we pass the mutations to spanner\r\n        SpannerWriteResult result = mutations.apply(\r\n            SpannerIO.write()\r\n                    .withInstanceId(&quot;myinstance&quot;)\r\n                    .withDatabaseId(&quot;mydatabase&quot;).grouped());\r\n\r\n        p.run().waitUntilFinish();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058168/google-dataflow-read-from-bigquery-combine-three-string-fields-write-key-valu/58086141#58086141","title":"Google DataFlow: Read from BigQuery, combine three string fields, write key/value fields to Google Cloud Spanner"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":10474363,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kOEMLlAYi98/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXQVABUifXiwfh92fRJUuo7cDxjXg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"eml","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10474363/eml"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569349209,"creation_date":1569226258,"question_id":58058168,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58058168","body_markdown":"None of the provided DataFlow templates match what I need to do, so I&#39;m trying to write my own.

tables are... temporary - they exist within one connection. So when executing procedure, table is created, then command is completed and temporary table is gone.\r\n\r\nYou can make &quot;more global&quot; temporary table by using double hash `##temptable`.\r\n\r\nFor better explanation refer to [this][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt;The classic temporary table comes in two flavors, the Global, or shareable, temporary table, prefixed by ‘##’, and the local temporary table, whose name is prefixed with ‘#’.The local temporary tables are less like normal tables than the Global temporary tables: You cannot create views on them, or associate triggers with them. It is a bit tricky to work out which process, session or procedure created them. We’ll give you a bit of help with that later. Most importantly, they are more secure than a global temporary table as only the owning process can see it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/temporary-tables-in-sql-server/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058155/how-to-retrieve-temptable-data-that-was-created-inside-a-stored-procedure-and-s/58058338#58058338","title":"How to retrieve #temptable data that was created inside a stored procedure and SqlCommand?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8348386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f5de7f743c1cced20022d0bde77d9dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Suraj S.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8348386/suraj-s"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569230708,"creation_date":1569230708,"answer_id":58059377,"question_id":58058155,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58059377","body_markdown":"if u want to use temp table data just select temp table data inside procedure ,i.e.    `select * from #LoanPriorProjected` your procedure will return result as a table then use datatable to show this table data.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058155/how-to-retrieve-temptable-data-that-was-created-inside-a-stored-procedure-and-s/58059377#58059377","title":"How to retrieve #temptable data that was created inside a stored procedure and SqlCommand?"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":11016349,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/00c5c58eb7fe94e6607f014c9adcf5c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jzoler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11016349/jzoler"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22200,"user_id":7132550,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1063981417044495/picture?type=large","display_name":"Michał Turczyn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7132550/micha%c5%82-turczyn"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58058338,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569230708,"creation_date":1569226233,"last_edit_date":1569228565,"question_id":58058155,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58058155","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been reading a lot of answers here on how to reuse `SqlCommand` but none of them are the answer to this problem.

(Hope that makes sense).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Background**: I am working on an event handler object which will receive a request and return a certain action to the caller (through &quot;method A&quot;). The event handler will then receive several separate responses to the action, each of which will trigger &quot;method B&quot;. The handler should wait for a response that is &quot;terminal&quot; and only then should it allow another request to come in. So I would like to block any incoming requests until I receive a terminal state on a response to the request that is currently being handled.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Approach so far**: I have tried using a CountDownLatch but the problem is that when I block the main thread in method A after receiving a request, method B does not get called at all because it is called on the same thread I assume.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058090/java-call-object-method-on-a-separate-thread","title":"Java - call object method on a separate thread"},{"tags":["java","android","serialization","jackson","jsonconvert"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20945,"user_id":51591,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0482bc8281dc2ce796b6d3bc2bf13981?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Michał Ziober","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/51591/micha%c5%82-ziober"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569241451,"post_id":58058086,"comment_id":102521118,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058086/abstract-class-as-value-in-jacksonsubtypes-types-which-further-has-jacksonsubt#comment102521118_58058086"}],"owner":{"reputation":44,"user_id":7594134,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hAANC5Hn32o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAuc/o12OIoZiFYc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Humxa Moghal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7594134/humxa-moghal"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569225952,"creation_date":1569225952,"question_id":58058086,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58058086","body_markdown":"    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, property = &quot;title&quot;)\r\n    @JsonSubTypes({@JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Service1.class, name=&quot;SERVICE1&quot;),\r\n                @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Service2.class, name = &quot;SERVICE2&quot;),\r\n                @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = Service3.class, name = &quot;SERVICE3&quot;),\r\n                @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = BaseTarget.class, name = &quot;TARGET&quot;)})\r\n        \r\n        @JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)\r\n    public abstract class BaseService extends BaseDomain implements Serializable {\r\n    \r\n        private String title;\r\n        private long requestTime;\r\n        private long acceptTime;\r\n        private long progressTime;\r\n        private long completedTime;\r\n        \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; This above is the BaseService class which is working fine for service\r\n&gt; 1 to 3 when it comes to mapping, problem is with BaseTarget which is\r\n&gt; an abstract class\r\n\r\n\r\n    @JsonTypeInfo(use = JsonTypeInfo.Id.NAME, property = &quot;associationType&quot;,visible = true)\r\n    @JsonSubTypes({@JsonSubTypes.Type(value = TargetService1.class, name = &quot;TARGET1&quot;),\r\n            @JsonSubTypes.Type(value = TargetService2.class, name = &quot;TARGET2&quot;)})\r\n    \r\n    public abstract class BaseTarget extends ImageNoteBase {\r\n    \r\n        private AssociationType associationType;\r\n        private ClientType clientType;\r\n        private Status charityStatus = Status.PENDING;\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis above BaseTarget is an abstract class which is annotated for further mapping but on run time compiler shows that **\r\n\r\n&gt; cannot create the instance of BaseTarget\r\n\r\n(I understand that very well that an abstract class cannot be instantiated).

\r\n    result_1, result_2= pool.starmap(func_parallel, [(file) for file in file_name_1_list])\r\n    pool.close()\r\n    \r\n**What I want with the above code:**\r\n\r\nAs I have two files in `file_name_1_list=[file_1, file_2]`,  and for each file, I should be getting two outputs.\r\n\r\nI want that `output_1` should go into `result_1` and `output_2` should go into `result_2` for each of the files given as an argument to my parallel function via `starmap`\r\n\r\nThe `result_1` and `result_2` are lists.\r\n\r\nHow can I change the above code to achieve my desired results (`output_1` should go into `result_1` and `output_2` should go into `result_2` for each of the files given as an argument to my parallel function via `starmap`)\r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n

I&#39;ve done my setup with the following article:  https://medium.com/@haydnjmorris/uploading-photos-to-aws-s3-getting-started-with-cognito-and-iam-c96ba5b5496d\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058065/swift-ios-unable-to-upload-image-to-aws-s3","title":"Swift iOS: Unable to Upload Image to AWS S3"},{"tags":["powerbi","dax"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":24437,"user_id":997660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Scxjl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Krasnov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997660/nick-krasnov"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569226983,"post_id":58058063,"comment_id":102513796,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058063/using-unichar-as-lights-indicator#comment102513796_58058063"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":10543537,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t7ZjTS5Ew2c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBfsl9b75nT5-h27pg3Un-nmEQEiA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sherendeep Kaur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10543537/sherendeep-kaur"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":24437,"user_id":997660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Scxjl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Krasnov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/997660/nick-krasnov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569227719,"post_id":58058063,"comment_id":102514143,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058063/using-unichar-as-lights-indicator#comment102514143_58058063"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12106049,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4748416c32674d9a1de5b85860382e94?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pradeep Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12106049/pradeep-reddy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569229848,"creation_date":1569229848,"answer_id":58059132,"question_id":58058063,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58059132","body_markdown":"You can achieve this by using conditional formatting in power bi for table/Matrix visual.\r\n\r\nYou need not to use any DAX formula.

PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The\r\n&gt; body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or\r\n&gt; updated.\r\n\r\nSo, you should be using **PUT** for moving resource data, as described here\r\n\r\n&gt; A PUT request creates a resource or updates an existing resource. The\r\n&gt; client specifies the URI for the resource. The request body contains a\r\n&gt; complete representation of the resource. If a resource with this URI\r\n&gt; already exists, it is replaced. Otherwise a new resource is created,\r\n&gt; if the server supports doing so. PUT requests are most frequently\r\n&gt; applied to resources that are individual items, such as a specific\r\n&gt; customer, rather than collections. A server might support updates but\r\n&gt; not creation via PUT. Whether to support creation via PUT depends on\r\n&gt; whether the client can meaningfully assign a URI to a resource before\r\n&gt; it exists.

an ASP.NET project, I generate N number of editboxes depending on a database query result at the launch of my app. Each textbox has an `id=&quot;textNid&quot;` with N = 0, 1 , 2...\r\n\r\nI understood that I could not play with editboxfor in this case, so I generate some input texts at the success of an AJAX call at the launch of my app.\r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\n    for (var i = 0; i &lt; data.length; i++) {\r\n        htmlToWrite += &quot;&lt;input type=\\&quot;text\\&quot; &quot;value=\\&quot;&quot; + data[i] + &quot;\\&quot;&quot; +\r\n

assign an `onpropertychange` method to each of these input depending of their id value.\r\n\r\nAfter /many) tries, I understood that `$(document).ready()` would not bind this kind of method to something which doesn&#39;t exist yet. \r\n\r\nI also read a few cases a bit similar to mine with an &quot;on + delegate&quot; solution, but I can&#39;t properly adapt it here.\r\n\r\nIn jQuery, how

you are using the `FOS/user-bundle` you can grant users roles, you can create your own or use the pre-defined (Admin is a predefined).\r\nhttps://symfony.com/doc/2.0.x/bundles/FOSUserBundle/index.html\r\n\r\nIf you really want to to this yourself one way you can have one model but different instantiations is you set your user to have a bool for whether it has a role and then make a new object when requested based on roles:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n/**\r\n * @ORM\\Entity(repositoryClass=&quot;AppBundle\\Repository\\UserRepository&quot;)\r\n * @ORM\\Table(name=&quot;users&quot;)\r\n */\r\nclass User\r\n{\r\n\r\n    /** @Column(name=&quot;`isApiUser`&quot;,

@Column(name=&quot;`isAdminUser`&quot;, type=&quot;boolean&quot;) */\r\n    private $isAdminUser;\r\n    \r\n    //....\r\n    public function getApiUser(): ?ApiUser\r\n    {\r\n        return $this-&gt;isApiUser() ? new ApiUser($this) : null;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public function getSiteUser(): SiteUser\r\n    {\r\n        return $this-&gt;isSiteUser() ? new SiteUser($this) : null;\r\n

Object do something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ApiUser\r\n{\r\n    private $userName;\r\n    \r\n    public function __construct(User $user)\r\n    {\r\n        $this-&gt;userName = $user-&gt;getUserName();\r\n        // Continue for whatever logic you want\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo the same for each of the user types.  \r\n\r\nThen when you want to use it in your controller (or whereever)\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass SomeController extends Controller\r\n{\r\n    public function indexAction()\r\n    {\r\n\r\n        $repository =

I verified that the labels were correctly stacked and yes they were. \r\n\r\nSo I tried to reshape the output of Dense(4096) into a matrix of size (10, 10) with a Reshape layer, fed it with the labels reshaped as stacked columns (or rows I don&#39;t remember), and it would not work with either binary or categorical crossentropy, so I guess that I should implement a custom loss. \r\n\r\nWhat would be the best way to solve this problem  ?\r\n\r\nThank you a lot.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058003/how-to-combine-lots-of-outputs-into-a-matrix-with-custom-loss-in-keras","title":"How to combine lots of outputs into a matrix with custom loss in Keras"},{"tags":["html","web-scraping","rpa","uipath"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":6735935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10209881813663230/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oliver Fuglsang Grooss","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6735935/oliver-fuglsang-grooss"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569246507,"post_id":58063754,"comment_id":102524165,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058001/uipath-data-scraping-scrape-element-names/58063754#comment102524165_58063754"},{"owner":{"reputation":2281,"user_id":4507417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a027c3ea839c86e05de0c5f22fc6a7d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marek Stejskal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4507417/marek-stejskal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30,"user_id":6735935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10209881813663230/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oliver Fuglsang Grooss","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6735935/oliver-fuglsang-grooss"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569250835,"post_id":58063754,"comment_id":102526712,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058001/uipath-data-scraping-scrape-element-names/58063754#comment102526712_58063754"},{"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":6735935,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10209881813663230/picture?type=large","display_name":"Oliver Fuglsang Grooss","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6735935/oliver-fuglsang-grooss"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569493987,"post_id":58063754,"comment_id":102618991,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58058001/uipath-data-scraping-scrape-element-names/58063754#comment102618991_58063754"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2281,"user_id":4507417,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a027c3ea839c86e05de0c5f22fc6a7d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marek Stejskal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4507417/marek-stejskal"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569245849,"creation_date":1569245849,"answer_id":58063754,"question_id":58058001,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58063754","body_markdown":"Like in many cases in RPA there are several possible solutions.

use the (amazing) lftp utility tool to upload files to a remote server (using a reverse mirror command).\r\n\r\nThey are first uploaded in a temporary folder, and after all of them have been uploaded (~ 6000 files, with project dependencies), I wish to rename that temporary folder.\r\n\r\nThe upload process:\r\n\r\n    lftp --env-password sftp://$LFTP_USERNAME@$LFTP_HOSTNAME -e &quot;mirror --reverse --verbose --delete build /home/whatever/tmp; bye&quot;\r\n\r\nResult of `/home/whatever` (on the FTP server), so far so good:\r\n\r\n    ├── tmp\r\n    |   ├── file1\r\n    |   ├── file2\r\n    |   ├── subfolder1\r\n    |   |   ├── file3\r\n    |   |   └── file4\r\n\r\nReading lftp documentation, there is a command named `mmv` which purpose is, if the entry path ends with a `/`, to rename the entire directory.\r\n\r\nHowever, it preserves the old directory name.\r\n\r\nI have not found any way to do such an operation with a glob pattern like `/home/whatever/tmp/*` unfortunately.\r\n\r\n    lftp --env-password sftp://$LFTP_USERNAME@$LFTP_HOSTNAME -e &quot;mkdir -pf /home/whatever/current; mmv /home/whatever/tmp/ /home/whatever/current; bye&quot;\r\n\r\nResult

files and folders is unknown, applying mmv on all subfolders or files under &quot;tmp&quot; is not an

The data I have is actually on state boundaries and geometries from data.gov on the state of Delaware.  The function delaware.m returns a cell array (1x3 cell) of polygon matrices describing the shape of the state of Delaware, and this is the shape I need to do operations on.  I will post the specific questions so you can get a sense of what I&#39;m being asked of, but I&#39;m still asking for more general guidance than a specific answer to each question.  \r\n\r\n1. Translate the state of Delaware so that its center is approximately at the origin.\r\n2. Dilate the translated state of Delaware so that it fits inside a square of side length one centered at the origin.\r\n3. Rotate the translated, dilated state of Delaware so that New Castle County is at the bottom and Sussex is at the top.\r\n4. Dilate the translated, dilated, rotated state of Delaware without changing its area, so that it is about as wide as it is tall.\r\n5. Shear the translated, dilated, rotated, dilated state of Delaware the northernmost tip is at least 2 units to the right of the southernmost tip.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, I know how to do all these operations in Matlab with just a single polygon/matrix.  I am mostly struggling with how to use this with the cell array.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, say I have matrix S.\r\n```\r\nnewS=S+[1;2]; %move S one unit to the right and two units up\r\n\r\nR=[sqrt(2)/2  -sqrt(2)/2; sqrt(2)/2  sqrt(2)/2];\r\nnewS=R*S  %rotate the polygon by 45 degrees\r\n\r\nD = [alpha 0; 0 beta]; \r\n%alpha is the dilation scaling the x direction and beta in the y direction\r\n%left multiply S by this dilation matrix to dilate along the cardinal axes\r\n\r\nSh=[1 y; 0 1] %y controls the amount of shearing\r\n%left multiply by S to shear a shape along the x-axis relative to the y-axis\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo for example, when I try to do an operation for moving the shape up/down/left/right as I described above for the cell array, I get the error message \r\n```Undefined operator &#39;+&#39; for input arguments of type &#39;cell&#39;.```\r\n\r\nI also tried:\r\n```\r\nDEBoundary1 = cellfun(@sum, DEBoundary, [75.562;-39.6]); \r\n%this is how much I wanted to move the polygons\r\n```\r\n \r\nBut got:\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt; Lab_code\r\nError using cellfun\r\nAll of the input arguments must be of the same size and shape.\r\nPrevious inputs had size 1 in dimension 1. Input #3 has size 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose in general, is there an easy way to take these operations I already know and apply them to a cell array consisting of polygon matrices?  Or do I have to go about it a different way?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58057977/apply-operations-to-a-cell-array-where-each-cell-is-a-polygon","title":"Apply operations to a cell
