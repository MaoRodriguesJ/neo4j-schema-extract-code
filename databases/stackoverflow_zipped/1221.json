That&#39;s why any change made to `a` mean also change in `b` and vice versa.\r\n\r\nWhen you copy maps, then *no copies* of the objects will be created, but *the same* instances will be put to the `logCopy`. Following code for your objects has the same explanation as the example above:\r\n```Groovy\r\n\tlog[&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;] = &quot;123&quot;\r\n\tprintln log    [&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;]\r\n\tprintln logCopy[&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;]\r\n\t\r\n\tlogCopy[&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;] = &quot;567&quot;\r\n\tprintln log    [&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;]\r\n\tprintln logCopy[&quot;letters&quot;][&quot;a&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis explains why your changes on one map are also visible in another map.\r\n\r\nWhat is different, are the map objects itself (not their contents). If you remove an element from the map *itself*, then you will see differences:\r\n```Groovy\r\n    log.remove(&quot;numbers&quot;)\r\n    println logCopy\r\n    println log\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuch behaviour of `putAll()` is not a bug. It is how it is supposed to work. The same way it works in Java. If you want to create a *deep* copy of a map, you should do that manually: You should iterate over each member variable, create their copies, iterate over member variables of the nested objects, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround you can serialize one map to a [byte stream][1] or to a to JSON and create a copy by deserializing. It is easier to implement than implementing deep copy method for each class. But check if performance if good for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13155127/deep-copy-map-in-groovy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251981/groovy-changes-of-elements-in-one-map-affect-elements-in-the-copy-of-this-map/58252902#58252902","title":"Groovy: Changes of elements in one map affect elements in the copy of this map"}],"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":11863408,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ed3cf8d43d841f2f92c6df089861c501?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Saber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11863408/saber"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2364,"user_id":1947216,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8b52eaf82bd907e8b39e49aeea74273e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mentallurg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1947216/mentallurg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570315996,"creation_date":1570306563,"last_edit_date":1570315996,"question_id":58251981,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251981","body_markdown":"In a filter function, I am trying to make a separate copy of a hashmap and remove some `null` elements from the original, however finally when I print the copyhashmap the same elements are removed from it too while I only want it to happen for the original one and the copy should stays unchanged. \r\n\r\nThis is my code;\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef filter(log){\r\n\r\n\tMap logCopy = [:]\r\n\tlogCopy.putAll((log))\r\n\r\n\tdef indexedLog = logCopy.keySet()\r\n\tfor(def i = 0; i &lt;indexedLog.size(); i++){\r\n\t\tdef subIndexedLog = logCopy[indexedLog[i]]\r\n\t\tdef subIndexedLogEntrySet = subIndexedLog.keySet();\r\n\t\tfor(def j = 0; j &lt;subIndexedLog.size(); j++){ \r\n\t\t\tif(subIndexedLog[subIndexedLogEntrySet[j]] == null){\r\n\t\t\t\tlog[indexedLog[i]].remove(subIndexedLogEntrySet[j])\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\tprintln logCopy\r\n\tprintln log\r\n\treturn log;\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\ndef log = [letters:[a: null, b: null, c: &quot;c&quot;], numbers: [1: null, 2: null, 3: 3]]\r\nfilter(log)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput;\r\n```\r\n[letters:[b:null, c:c], numbers:[2:null, 3:3]]\r\n[letters:[b:null, c:c], numbers:[2:null, 3:3]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am so confused that when a null element is removed from `log` in the loop, why the same element is also removed from logCopy, and why `b` which indeed have a `null` value is not removed.

Here is my code:\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n    from lmfit.models import GaussianModel, LinearModel\r\n    \r\n    data = np.loadtxt(&quot;data.txt&quot;)\r\n    x = data[:,0]\r\n    y = data[:,1]\r\n    err = data[:,2]\r\n    \r\n    background = LinearModel(prefix=&#39;line1_&#39;)\r\n    pars = background.guess(y,x=x)\r\n    \r\n    peak1 = GaussianModel(prefix=&#39;g1_&#39;)\r\n    pars.update(peak1.make_params())\r\n    \r\n    pars[&#39;g1_center&#39;].set(9200, min=9000, max=10000)\r\n    pars[&#39;g1_sigma&#39;].set(300, min=100, max=700)\r\n    \r\n    peak2 = GaussianModel(prefix=&#39;g2_&#39;)\r\n    pars.update(peak2.make_params())\r\n    \r\n    pars[&#39;g2_center&#39;].set(10500, min=10000, max=11000)\r\n    pars[&#39;g2_sigma&#39;].set(300, min=100, max=700)\r\n    \r\n    peak3 = GaussianModel(prefix=&#39;g3_&#39;)\r\n    pars.update(peak3.make_params())\r\n    \r\n    pars[&#39;g3_center&#39;].set(13000, min=12000, max=14000)\r\n    pars[&#39;g3_sigma&#39;].set(300, min=100, max=700)\r\n    \r\n    model =  peak1 + peak2 + peak3 + background\r\n    weight = 1/err**2/np.sum(1/err**2)\r\n    \r\n    out = model.fit(y, pars, x=x)#, weights = weight)\r\n    \r\n    print(out.fit_report(min_correl=0.1))\r\n    \r\n    plt.errorbar(x,y,err, fmt=&quot;b.&quot;)\r\n    plt.plot(x, out.best_fit, &#39;r-&#39;)\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\nIf for the fit I use this: `out = model.fit(y, pars, x=x)`, so without using the errors on the y, I get these values for the parameters (I post just mu and sigma here):\r\n\r\n    mu_1 =  9359.791209085675  +/-  5.509374978209427\r\n    sigma_1 =  348.86904194695535  +/-  6.18259118657156\r\n    mu_2 =  10522.11131671362  +/-  3.288369260611981\r\n    sigma_2 =  243.53890651538205  +/-  3.43678656935972\r\n    mu_3 =  13098.71965433265  +/-  4.737992827401577\r\n    sigma_3 =  324.0256260123612  +/-  5.054936854719746\r\n\r\nand this is the fit itself:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I want to take into account the errors: `out = model.fit(y, pars, x=x, weights = weight)` (the weight are the inverse of the squares of the errors, as the formula for the least-square fit is sum{1/sigma^2*(y_data-y_pred)^2}, right?) I get these numbers:\r\n\r\n    mu_1 =  9979.839872555114  +/-  12.208145818989209\r\n    sigma_1 =  296.96756984463025  +/-  30.943773101487675\r\n    mu_2 =  10000.004017862604  +/-  14.082237906871443\r\n    sigma_2 =  424.30653650290424  +/-  22.751836748822086\r\n    mu_3 =  13103.00302126283  +/-  10.795125319448884\r\n    sigma_3 =  328.0535307828716  +/-  8.157121458823843\r\n\r\nand this fit:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nNot only the fit looks bad, but the printed parameters are not even what the figure shows (the center of the first peak is for sure smaller than 9980). Can someone tell me what is going on? Am I using the weights parameter the way it is supposed to be used? Why does the fit looks so bad now? Why are the printed parameters wrong? And how can I fix it?

This is probably a very basic question, but I don&#39;t know what to search to resolve it.*\r\n\r\nI&#39;m working on a C++ program in Visual Studio 2019 on Windows 10. I would like to use  64-bit gstreamer in this program. I have followed the [official installation instructions][1] exactly (including adding the folder to PATH). However, I cannot build the examples.\r\n\r\nAt first, I was just getting errors about not being able to load several source files. I was able to fix this by manually adding several paths to **Additional Include Directories**:[Image of additional include folders required to resolve issue][2]\r\n\r\nNow I am getting errors of the following type: \r\n\r\n    Unresolved external symbol __imp_gst_init referenced in function main\r\n\r\nwhere *gst_init* is a real function called in the example. This appears to be something to do with trying to link to a dynamic library when you are actually linking to a static library (in this case since I am linked directly to the .h files, I presume I am linking to a static library). However, I don&#39;t understand where/how I indicate that these functions should be found in static libraries.\r\n\r\nI have two questions:\r\n\r\n 1. Why am I having to manually add these include folders? Do I have something set up weirdly?\r\n 2.

It&#39;s only like an alias, which is transformed into TINYINT(1) before it is stored in the database. You won&#39;t find any mention of BOOLEAN in the metadata for a column.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s like if you store an integer value from an expression `ABS(?)`. You don&#39;t know if the original value passed to ABS() was positive or negative, because only the result of the ABS() expression is stored.\r\n\r\nBy the way, TINYINT(1) doesn&#39;t mean it allows only a small number range. It&#39;s natural to think the (1) is a size limit, like it is for CHAR or DECIMAL. But for integer types in MySQL, it has no effect on the size of the data type or the range of values it accepts. TINYINT is always an 8-bit integer, and accepts values from -128 to 127, or for TINYINT UNSIGNED it always accepts values from 0 to 255. \r\n\r\nSee also my answer to https://stackoverflow.com/a/3135854/20860\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251926/mysql-from-boolean-to-tinyint1-and-back/58251963#58251963","title":"MySQL: From Boolean to Tinyint(1) and back"}],"owner":{"reputation":2399,"user_id":1087370,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33d689f553eee2fc358f028c599b8b39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1087370/alex"},"last_editor":{"reputation":403503,"user_id":20860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iavmP.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bill Karwin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/20860/bill-karwin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58251963,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570382625,"creation_date":1570306061,"last_edit_date":1570382625,"question_id":58251926,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251926","body_markdown":"I do not want to be picky but why the moment you define a table column to be boolean the very next moment you try to get back table structure it is returned as tinyint(1)?\r\n\r\nSo for as for a table created with\r\n\r\n    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `test` (\r\n        `aField` BOOLEAN DEFAULT true\r\n    );\r\n\r\nThe moment I try to get it&#39;s structure with\r\n\r\n    SHOW COLUMNS FROM test\r\n\r\nI got\r\n\r\n    +--------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n    | Field  | Type       | Null | Key | Default | Extra |\r\n    +--------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n    | aField | tinyint(1) | YES  |     | 1       |       |\r\n    +--------+------------+------+-----+---------+-------+\r\n\r\nI have not (a big) problem with the fact that a boolean is stored as a tinyint(1) but I have a problem with the fact that **the moment you see a tinyint(1) you do not know if that was originally created as a boolean or as a tiny int to store small number range**.

[C:\\Xyz\\tip\\UI\\SSOLauncher\\SSOLauncher.csproj]\r\n\r\nAll our projects reference System.Net.Http like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;Reference Include=&quot;System.Net.Http&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nNo project does binding redirects for this assembly in its app.config or web.config file. \r\n\r\nAll the projects target the .NET framework 4.7.2, but some 3rd party dependencies are .NET Standard.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have searched the Internet and:\r\n\r\n 1. Some claim that referencing System.Net.Http should only be done from NuGet, some say the opposite.\r\n 1. Some claim that binding redirects are necessary, others - the opposite.\r\n 1. Some say the problem was resolved with .NET Framework 4.7.2 (obviously not)\r\n\r\nI also know:\r\n\r\n - The GAC contains System.Net.Http.dll with the Assembly Version of `4.0.0.0` and the File Version of `4.7.3190.0 built by: NET472REL1LAST_C`. From which I conclude it correspond to .NET 4.7.2\r\n - On the other hand, during the compilation, msbuild resolves the reference to `c:\\Program Files (x86)\\Reference Assemblies\\Microsoft\\Framework\\.NETFramework\\v4.7.2\\System.Net.Http.dll`, which has the Assembly Version of `4.2.0.0` and the File Version of `4.7.3062.0 built by: NET472REL1`.\r\n\r\nNow I am confused. The file version of System.Net.Http.dll from the Reference Assemblies suggests it is older than that from the GAC, but its Assembly Version is 4.2.0.0 ? How will this dependency be resolved at run-time on a machine that has the version 4.0.0.0 in the GAC and nothing else? Checking the Reference Assemblies for older .NET versions (like 3.7.1 and below) shows System.Net.Http.dll with the Assembly Version of 4.0.0.0, so this mess is introduced with the .NET framework 4.7.2\r\n\r\nSo, how do I make the damn thing compile cleanly? Also, I do not understand how come only AspNetCompiler complains. How does one troubleshoot it at all? The binary log does not seem to help with AspNetCompiler errors one bit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251873/what-is-the-right-way-to-reference-system-net-http-when-targeting-net-4-7-2","title":"What is the right way to reference System.Net.Http when targeting .NET 4.7.2?"},{"tags":["node.js","express","mongoose"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14847,"user_id":1915893,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/580b31b0be7173bbc477ca1d6967d87c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aluan Haddad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1915893/aluan-haddad"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570307495,"creation_date":1570307495,"answer_id":58252103,"question_id":58251870,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58252103","body_markdown":"You are composing various general-purpose libraries that fill a variety of use cases.

have a number of Services running against Pods hosted within a cluster on Google Cloud K8&#39;s.\r\n\r\n**Service 1** is an Ingress - `basic-ingress`\r\n\r\n**Service 2** is a NodeJS API Gateway w/ 2 Pods - `security-gateway-svc`\r\n\r\n**Service 3** is a NodeJS API w/ 2 Pods - `some-random-api-svc`\r\n\r\nand so on service 4 / 5 / 6 etc....\r\n\r\nMy Ingress allows me to access exposed services via a sub domain however I would like to move my external API&#39;s behind my Gateway so I can handle auth etc in the gateway.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;d like to do is allow `security-gateway-svc` to connect to `some-random-api-svc` without having to go via dns or outside of my cluster.\r\n\r\nI figured I could update my ingress so all sub domains use the same service entry and allow the Gateway to figure out where the traffic should go.\r\n\r\nI can configure this just fine locally as everything runs on `localhost` and I specify a `port` so it&#39;s fairly straight forward.\r\n\r\nIs it possible however to expose pods to other pods within a cluster via the service name instead of an actual domain / dns look

You want to find the substance with the max boiling point (both the name and temperature), and then you want to find the average boiling point of all substances. In order to save the name of the substance with the max boiling point, and the boiling point itself will take two variables, as `std::string` and a `double`, say `namemax` and `max`.\r\n\r\nYou also need to compute the average boiling point. To compute an average you will need a `double` to hold the `sum` and then an integer value to hold the number of boiling points read. (say `size_t cnt = 0;`)\r\n\r\nIt is then a matter of reading each `name` and `boiling` point (which should be `std::string` and `double`, respectively) As you loop reading the `name` and `boiling`, within your loop you want to compare if `boiling &gt; max` and if so, update `max = boiling;` and `namemax = name;` to capture the substance and boiling point as the new max. You update the counter `cnt` on each pair of `name` and `boiling` read.\r\n\r\nWhen your loop exits, you have `namemax` and `max` containing the substance with the highest boiling point, so all that remains is computing the average boiling point as `sum / cnt`.\r\n\r\nTo put that together start with declaring your variables and opening your file, e.g.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main (int argc, char **argv) {\r\n        \r\n        if (argc &lt; 2) {\r\n            std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error: insufficient arguments\\n&quot;\r\n                    &lt;&lt; &quot;usage: &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; &quot; filename\\n&quot;;\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        double boiling, sum = 0, max = 0;\r\n        size_t cnt = 0;\r\n        std::string name, namemax;\r\n        std::ifstream f(argv[1]);\r\n\r\nNow loop reading the `name` and `boiling` from each line. **Note:** how you control the read loop based on the successful read of **both** `name` and `boiling`, e.g.\r\n\r\n        while (f &gt;&gt; name &amp;&amp; f &gt;&gt; boiling) {\r\n            sum += boiling;                   /* update sum with boiling */\r\n            if (boiling &gt; max) {              /* is boiling &gt; max?, if so */\r\n                max = boiling;                /* update max */\r\n                namemax = name;               /* update namenax */\r\n            }\r\n            cnt++;                            /* increment counter */\r\n        }\r\n\r\nNow all that remains is computing the average and outputting the results (which you can do all at once):\r\n\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;average boiling pt. of &quot; &lt;&lt; cnt &lt;&lt; &quot; substances\\n  &quot;\r\n                &lt;&lt; sum / cnt\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n\\nsubstance with max boiling point\\n  &quot; &lt;&lt; namemax\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;  (&quot; &lt;&lt; max &lt;&lt; &quot;)\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nDone! Putting it altogether you can do:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main (int argc, char **argv) {\r\n        \r\n        if (argc &lt; 2) {\r\n            std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;error: insufficient arguments\\n&quot;\r\n                    &lt;&lt; &quot;usage: &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; &quot; filename\\n&quot;;\r\n            return 1;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        double boiling, sum = 0, max = 0;\r\n        size_t cnt = 0;\r\n        std::string name, namemax;\r\n        std::ifstream f(argv[1]);\r\n        \r\n        while (f &gt;&gt; name &amp;&amp; f &gt;&gt; boiling) {\r\n            sum += boiling;\r\n            if (boiling &gt; max) {\r\n                max = boiling;\r\n                namemax = name;\r\n            }\r\n            cnt++;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;average boiling pt. of &quot; &lt;&lt; cnt &lt;&lt; &quot; substances\\n  &quot;\r\n                &lt;&lt; sum / cnt\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n\\nsubstance with max boiling point\\n  &quot; &lt;&lt; namemax\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;  (&quot; &lt;&lt; max &lt;&lt; &quot;)\\n&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/boilingpt dat/boiling.txt\r\n    average boiling pt. of 24 substances\r\n      108.583\r\n    \r\n    substance with max boiling point\r\n      Tar  (300)\r\n\r\n**Adding Output Of Each Line**\r\n\r\nPer-your comment, you also need to output each of the values read from the file. You can do that at the beginning of your loop and simply output the values. But, let&#39;s introduce you to `std::setw()` which allows you to set the width of the next output (the `name`) so that when you output `boiling` they will be in a nice column and not staggered back and forth. To use `std::setw()`, you just provide the width, e.g. `std::setw(12)` will work in your case. The `std::setw()` function is in the `&lt;iomanip&gt;` header, so add `#include &lt;iomanip&gt;` up top.\r\n\r\nWhen you use `std::setw()` you also want to make sure the text is `left-justified`, so we will also include `std::left` in the output as well. To output each line in a nice manner you can change the code above to:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;substances and boiling points:\\n&quot;;    /* output heading */\r\n        while (f &gt;&gt; name &amp;&amp; f &gt;&gt; boiling) {           /* read name/boiling pt */\r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;  &quot; &lt;&lt; std::setw(12) &lt;&lt; std::left\r\n                    &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &quot;\\t&quot; &lt;&lt; boiling &lt;&lt; &#39;\\n&#39;;   /* output */\r\n            sum += boiling;             /* add boiling to sum */\r\n            if (boiling &gt; max) {        /* is boiling &gt; max, if so */\r\n                max = boiling;          /* update max with boiling */\r\n                namemax = name;         /* update namemax with name */\r\n            }\r\n            cnt++;      /* increment counter */\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;\\naverage boiling pt. of &quot; &lt;&lt; cnt &lt;&lt; &quot; substances\\n  &quot;\r\n                &lt;&lt; sum / cnt\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n\\nsubstance with max boiling point\\n  &quot; &lt;&lt; namemax\r\n                &lt;&lt; &quot;  (&quot; &lt;&lt; max &lt;&lt; &quot;)\\n&quot;;\r\n\r\n(**note:** I included the final output line as well because I added a `&#39;\\n&#39;` to the beginning so it would be separated from your list by a blank-line)\r\n\r\n**Example Use/Output**\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/boilingpt dat/boiling.txt\r\n    substances and boiling points:\r\n      Acetaldehyde  20.8\r\n      Acetone       50.5\r\n      Acetylene     -84\r\n      Ammonia       -35.5\r\n      Aniline       184.4\r\n      Benzene       80.4\r\n      Chloroform    62.2\r\n      Ethane        -88\r\n      Ether         35\r\n      Furfurol      161.7\r\n      Glycerin      290\r\n      Glycerine     290\r\n      Naphthalene   218\r\n      Nitrobenzene  210.9\r\n      Petrol        95\r\n      Petroleum     210\r\n      Phenol        182\r\n      Propane       -43\r\n      Propylene     -47.7\r\n      Tar           300\r\n      Toluene       110.6\r\n      Turpentine    160\r\n      Water         100\r\n      Xylene        142.7\r\n    \r\n    average boiling pt. of 24 substances\r\n      108.583\r\n    \r\n    substance with max boiling point\r\n      Tar  (300)\r\n\r\nIf you had not used `std::left` after using `std::setw(12)`, the substance names would be right-justified (again, not a bad look), e.g.\r\n\r\n    $ ./bin/boilingpt dat/boiling.txt\r\n    substances and boiling points:\r\n      Acetaldehyde  20.8\r\n           Acetone  50.5\r\n         Acetylene  -84\r\n           Ammonia  -35.5\r\n           Aniline  184.4\r\n           Benzene  80.4\r\n        Chloroform  62.2\r\n            Ethane  -88\r\n             Ether  35\r\n          Furfurol  161.7\r\n          Glycerin  290\r\n         Glycerine  290\r\n       Naphthalene  218\r\n      Nitrobenzene  210.9\r\n            Petrol  95\r\n         Petroleum  210\r\n            Phenol  182\r\n           Propane  -43\r\n         Propylene  -47.7\r\n               Tar  300\r\n           Toluene  110.6\r\n        Turpentine  160\r\n             Water  100\r\n            Xylene  142.7\r\n    \r\n    average boiling pt. of 24 substances\r\n      108.583\r\n    \r\n    substance with max boiling point\r\n      Tar  (300)\r\n\r\n\r\nLook things over and let me know if you have further questions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251857/utilizing-data-from-input-file-string-and-int-and-utilizing-in-loop/58252174#58252174","title":"Utilizing data from input file (string and int) and utilizing in loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12169957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156850987669403/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ian Ray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169957/ian-ray"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12169957,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10156850987669403/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ian Ray","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12169957/ian-ray"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58252174,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570376538,"creation_date":1570305457,"last_edit_date":1570376538,"question_id":58251857,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251857","body_markdown":"I must create a program that gets data from an input file and from that returns an average and maximum (both boiling point and associated string &#39;substance&#39;).

If it helps, we are at the point of discussing &#39;for&#39; loops, in class.\r\n\r\n****EDIT****\r\n\r\nThus Far:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;iomanip&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    \r\n    using namespace std;\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n    ///declare variables\r\n    double boiling, maximum=0,sum=0;\r\n    string substance, substancemax;\r\n    \r\n    ///declare input stream variable\r\n    ifstream inData;\r\n    \r\n    ///open input file\r\n    inData.open(&quot;input.txt&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    ///Read the boiling temps\r\n    inData&gt;&gt;substance&gt;&gt;boiling;\r\n    \r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Common Chemicals &amp; Substances:&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;left&lt;&lt;setw(10)&lt;&lt;&quot;Substance&quot;\r\n        &lt;&lt;right&lt;&lt;setw(13)&lt;&lt;&quot;Boiling Point&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;--------------------------------------&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;left&lt;&lt;setw(10)&lt;&lt;substance\r\n        &lt;&lt;right&lt;&lt;setw(13)&lt;&lt;boiling&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n        ///run a loop w/ &#39;if&#39; to read the data and calculate the minimum\r\n    while(inData)\r\n    {\r\n        ///read temperature\r\n        inData&gt;&gt;boiling;\r\n        sum=sum+boiling;\r\n    \r\n            ///compare boiling with current maximum w/ &#39;if&#39;\r\n        if (boiling&gt;maximum)\r\n        {\r\n            substancemax=substance;   ///update max substance\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ///Display the data to the screen\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;fixed&lt;&lt;showpoint&lt;&lt;setprecision(2);\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\\nThe average boiling point is &quot;&lt;&lt;sum/24.0&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\\nThe substance with the highest BP is &quot;&lt;&lt;substancemax&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    cout&lt;&lt;&quot;\\nThe highest boiling point is &quot;&lt;&lt;maximum&lt;&lt;endl;\r\n    \r\n    ///close the input file\r\n    inData.close();\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        return 0;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe parameters of the &#39;while&#39; statement still eludes me, likely in addition to other issues.\r\n\r\n\r\n********FINAL EDIT************\r\n\r\nI have the program working with the &#39;for&#39; loop (which I assume is required since that is the chapter we are on) minus the fact that it outputs a number in the boiling point row.

most cases, projects bigger than hello-world require the use of a build-tool.\r\n\r\nPopular build-tools for Scala projects are `sbt`, `maven` and `gradle`. \r\n\r\nEach of these build tools have their own way of adding dependency libraries to the project.\r\n\r\nSo, the first question is - which build tool are you even using for your project ?\r\n\r\nIn case of `sbt`, then the project configuration is done using `build.sbt` file. \r\n\r\nA basic sbt project looks like following,\r\n\r\n    YourProject\r\n    ├── build.sbt\r\n    ├── project\r\n    │   └── build.properties\r\n    └── src\r\n        └── main\r\n            └── scala\r\n                └── YouCode.scala\r\n\r\nYou can create this structure manually or if you are using IntelliJ Idea, You can create a new `sbt` project simply by using `File -&gt; New -&gt; Project -&gt; Scala -&gt; sbt`.\r\n\r\nAs a beginner, I will strongly suggest that you use IntelliJ Idea with Scala plugin. That will help you in simplifying a lot of things.\r\n\r\nFor more details on setting things up both using intellj and sbt- https://www.scala-lang.org/download/ . \r\n\r\nThe `project/build.properties` provides the `sbt` version used for this project,\r\n   \r\n    sbt.version = 1.3.0\r\n\r\nA bare bone `build.sbt` looks like following,\r\n\r\n    name := &quot;YourProject&quot;\r\n\r\n    version := &quot;1.0&quot;\r\n\r\n    scalaVersion := &quot;2.12.8&quot;\r\n\r\nNow, In your newly created project, you can add the rocks-db library (and other libs) as dependency by adding following to your `build.sbt`,\r\n\r\n    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(\r\n      &quot;org.rocksdb&quot; % &quot;rocksdbjni&quot; % &quot;6.2.2&quot;,\r\n      &quot;some.other&quot; % &quot;some-dependecy&quot; % &quot;other-version&quot;,\r\n      ...\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\nI have included the version &quot;6.2.2&quot; in here. As for which version of rocksdb library, that will depend on the version of rocksdb you are connecting to it. Best is to choose the same version as the rocksdb version.\r\n\r\n\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251846/error-object-rocksdb-is-not-a-member-of-package-orgs/58252463#58252463","title":"Error: object rocksdb is not a member of package orgs"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":6715471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a9751d9fff469172409acafd661d4595?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Razor21","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6715471/razor21"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570311899,"creation_date":1570305359,"question_id":58251846,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251846","body_markdown":"I am facing issue with using rocksDb library in scala.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to import org.rocksdb.RocksDB;\r\nin my code but I keep hitting with this error: \r\n\r\nobject rocksdb is not a member of package org.\r\n\r\nI searched online and found that using build.sbt and including the library dependency might solve the issue but I have no idea which version to use.

Hope this helps, Hans.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251801/show-view-controller-when-app-is-returning-from-background-ios-13/58251872#58251872","title":"Show view controller when app is returning from background (iOS 13)"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":11053193,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AsA3G.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Marian Stiehler","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11053193/marian-stiehler"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58251872,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570305805,"creation_date":1570304967,"question_id":58251801,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251801","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to show a password prompt every time my app returns from the background (trust me, it makes sense, it&#39;s not annoying; it&#39;s similar to what 1Password does).\r\n\r\nSo **I need to show a certain ViewController every time the app enters the foreground** or **every 10 minutes**.\r\n\r\nI tried a lot, but I don&#39;t seem to get it to work.

I can&#39;t wrap my head around why the 5s would be completely removed but the 4s would not.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251796/how-to-remove-duplicates-from-a-list-using-this-function","title":"How to remove duplicates from a list using this function?"},{"tags":["java","arrays","random","2d"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":5520975,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/PKBHm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"thnkndblv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5520975/thnkndblv"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570327046,"creation_date":1570327046,"answer_id":58253693,"question_id":58251795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58253693","body_markdown":"May you are looking for something like this?\r\n\r\n    import java.util.Random;\r\n\r\n    class RandomPairGenerator {\r\n      public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        String[] test = { &quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;indigo&quot;, &quot;violet&quot;, &quot;white&quot; };\r\n        RandomPairGenerator pairGenerator = new RandomPairGenerator();\r\n\r\n        String[][] pairs = pairGenerator.randomPairs(test, 4);\r\n\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; pairs[0].length; i++) {\r\n          System.out.println(pairs[0][i] + &quot; &quot; + pairs[1][i]);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      String[][] randomPairs(String[] collection, int numberOfPairs) {\r\n        Random random = new Random();\r\n        String[][] pairs = new String[ 2 ][ numberOfPairs ];\r\n    \r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; numberOfPairs; i++) {\r\n          pairs[0][i] = collection[ random.nextInt(numberOfPairs) ];\r\n          pairs[1][i] = collection[ random.nextInt(numberOfPairs) ];\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return pairs;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nTo generate your 2D array assign values using random indexes in your source vector.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251795/how-can-i-make-a-2d-array-that-has-pairs-of-random-elements-of-another-array/58253693#58253693","title":"How can I make a 2d array that has pairs of random elements of another array?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12041255,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AP2pO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Invisible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12041255/invisible"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570327046,"creation_date":1570304907,"question_id":58251795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58251795","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to make 2d array that has paired random elements.

of all, in most cases, an Android device acting as a server is a bad design, since cell telephony providers currently assign private IPs and not public ones to their clients, so your listening ports will be inaccessible from the Internet.\r\nIt would only work within a LAN and connected through WiFi.\r\n\r\nYour server task is not strictly required to be created in a Service, it can be created in other classes of the app, but you will need to create a Service if you want your server thread to not stop when the phone enters sleep mode, so to avoid this you will need to create a Foreground Service (a service that calls startForeground()) and also use a PowerManager.WakeLock.\r\n\r\nTo communicate the task with the UI thread, I recommend you to use messages, for that to work in UI thread you create an instance of a Handler derived class and overwrite the handleMessage() method. \r\n\r\nFrom the server thread you can send messages using sendMessage() to the Handle derived instance and you will receive them in handleMessage() in the UI thread.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58251784/how-should-components-interact-in-multithread-android-application/58252210#58252210","title":"How should components interact in

want to make a simple Android application that must do some heavy work in background. I&#39;m completely new to Android development and need an advice on how to design this application properly.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nSo, my application needs to run a server in background that accepts a client and communicates continuously with the client until the user decides to stop the server. I have a simple activity that has a button that must start and stop the server. My current thoughts are:&lt;br/&gt;\r\n&lt;ul&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;Pressing the button should start a service&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;The service must start a separate thread which will do all the work of the server.\r\n&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nI think I should create three classes: `Activity` class, `Service` class (ask the system to run the foreground `Service` so the process won&#39;t be killed if the user closes the Activity), and the `Server` class which can be `Thread` or `AsyncTask`.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nThe problem is that some events can occur on the Server thread that the user should be aware of, so those events must trigger some changes in the UI like showing a message. I could notify the user by manipulating the UI in the `onProgressUpdate()` method or `runOnUiThread()` but that feels off. Moreover, I think that violates the single responsibility principle as the Server does the work that is not expected. Maybe I should notify the `Service` somehow which, in turn, will do all the work to notify the user?&lt;br/&gt;Moreover, I need to be able to control the server from UI somehow. So, just calling the `Service` and forgetting about it is not an option.&lt;br/&gt;\r\nSo, my question is how to make a good design of the application?

The reason I want to do this is, because I want to calculate the height of the tree. To do this, first I need to contruct the tree. I already know how to construct the tree using the ```treelib package```. My problem now is, if I have a large dataset consisting of thousands of rows, how can I order my data in such a way that I am able to build a tree.\r\n\r\nWhat I have already tried is to sort the Parent column by the values in the Child column using the .sort_values in pandas. This, however, did not work the way I wanted it to. I also tried to do this with the group by function and somehow give the rows a certain rank based on this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34347041/pandas-sort-a-column-by-values-in-another-column. \r\n\r\nThis did not work for the large dataset. \r\n\r\nBelow is the result that I want to get. \r\n\r\n    Child\t      Parent\r\n    273500\t      273500   # The first row is the parent row\r\n    20574624\t  273500   # I want all children that belong to this parent node\r\n    1879450\t      20574624 #  \r\n    18441258\t  20574624\r\n    19770000\t  20574624\r\n    19931554\t  20574624\r\n    20631784\t  20574624\r\n    20637582\t  20574624\r\n    20840426\t  20574624\r\n    20844632\t  20574624\r\n    20934910\t  20574624\r\n    20965442\t  20574624\r\n    21193122\t  20574624\r\n    2202652\t      1879450 # Now, I want all the children that belong to 1879450\r\n    18382902\t  1879450 # and so on\r\n    19780666\t  1879450\r\n    19933526\t  1879450\r\n    18352628\t  19770000\r\n    18000796\t  18352628\r\n    19681810\t  18352628\r\n    1359996\t      20574624\r\n    21194666\t  21193122\r\n\r\n\r\nFor such a small dataset, one could easily order it by hand.
