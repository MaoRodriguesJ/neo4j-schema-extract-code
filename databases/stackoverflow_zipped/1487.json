Then, ```App.js``` figures out whether to set ```open``` to ```true``` or ```false```, (which most likely just means toggling it).\r\n\r\nOnce ```App.js``` updates its state, it will pass that updated value down to ```header``` and ```Navbar``` and that&#39;s the beauty of React.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188391/how-to-pass-the-state-property-as-prop-to-show-and-hide-component-in-react-when/58188625#58188625","title":"how to pass the state property as prop to show and hide component in react when it&#39;s asynchronous update"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":2183702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/920860680c81b21df4e7e82556d301dc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"beroburny","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2183702/beroburny"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569947515,"creation_date":1569947515,"answer_id":58188987,"question_id":58188391,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58188987","body_markdown":"Your Question is kinda not understandable and only can figure out you want to use conditional rendering.\r\nRead this [https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html][1]  \r\nHope it will help you :)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188391/how-to-pass-the-state-property-as-prop-to-show-and-hide-component-in-react-when/58188987#58188987","title":"how to pass the state property as prop to show and hide component in react when it&#39;s asynchronous update"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user12143749"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58188625,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569947515,"creation_date":1569945020,"question_id":58188391,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188391","body_markdown":"i have a navbar when i click on it i&#39;m setting my state to true and passing it in my component as  prop but the function takes time update it and my props are sent as false how can i send my updated prop when the state update is complete \r\n\r\nnavbar.js\r\n\r\n\r\n     constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = {\r\n          burgerClicked:false,\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n     burgerClicked=()=&gt;{\r\n        this.setState({ burgerClicked: true },()=&gt;{   this.props.clicked(this.state.burgerClicked)})\r\n      }\r\n\r\napp.js\r\n\r\n     constructor(props){\r\n        super(props);\r\n         this.state={\r\n          open:false,\r\n         }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n     openSideNav =(burgerClicked)=&gt;{// the time is taking here to update it send open as false \r\n         this.setState({open:burgerClicked},()=&gt;{\r\n           console.log(this.state.open)\r\n         });\r\n       \r\n     &lt;Navbar clicked={this.openSideNav} tokenRequested={this.request}/&gt;\r\n     &lt;Header  open={this.state.open} /&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nheader.js\r\n\r\n    constructor(props) {\r\n        super(props);\r\n        this.state = { showSideNav: false };\r\n      }\r\n\r\n  \r\n    UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(){\r\n        // \r\n        console.log(this.props.open,this.state.showSideNav);//this.props.open is false\r\n        \r\n        if (this.props.open) {\r\n          this.setState({showSideNav:this.props.open},()=&gt;{\r\n            console.log(this.state.showSideNav);

you write `imag(D)`, you&#39;ll see that the imaginary component of the eigenvalues are in the order of 1e-18. That is within rounding error of 0 (when compared to the magnitude of the eigenvalues). But because MATLAB doesn&#39;t know the eigenvalues are supposed to be real-valued, it gives them to you as complex numbers.\r\n\r\nIf you know the eigenvalues are supposed to be real-valued, simply take their real part:\r\n```matlab\r\nD = real(D);\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRegarding the edited question:\r\n\r\nThe matrix `coh` is almost Hermitian, but not exactly. You can check for example this way:\r\n```matlab\r\nmax(abs(reshape((coh - coh&#39;)./coh, 1, [])))\r\n```\r\nThis returns 1.9e-15. This is an order of magnitude larger than `eps`, which is the reason that MATLAB does not consider it Hermitian.\r\n\r\nThe matrix entered in the Python code is slightly different. If I copy those values to MATLAB, I see this:\r\n```matlab\r\ncoh2 = [0.32706471+0.0j, -0.00770058+0.01789483j, -0.00368526-0.00615056j\r\n       -0.00770058-0.01789483j,  0.0122797+0.0j, -0.00082258+0.00029527j\r\n       -0.00368526+0.00615056j, -0.00082258-0.00029527j, 0.00526291+0.0j];\r\nmax(abs(reshape((coh2 - coh2&#39;)./coh2, 1, [])))\r\n```\r\nThis code returns 0. Also `ishermitian(coh2)` returns `true`.\r\n\r\nFinally, comparing the eigenvalues of `coh` and `coh2`, we find a difference of the order of magnitude 1e-8:\r\n```matlab\r\nflip(real(eig(coh))) - eig(coh2) % `flip` fixes the ordering difference\r\nans =\r\n   1.0e-08 *\r\n   0.085548579158157\r\n   0.539922194800480\r\n  -0.238091968363108\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188372/different-eigenvectors-of-the-same-hermitian-matrix-in-matlabpython/58204413#58204413","title":"different eigenvectors of the same hermitian matrix in matlab&amp;python"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12148428,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAiOFRYkT0IQD0_gkbcKseqCIM4vzl09Fl_89IP=k-s128","display_name":"Mehmet Furkan &#199;ELİK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12148428/mehmet-furkan-%c3%87el%c4%b0k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12148428,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAiOFRYkT0IQD0_gkbcKseqCIM4vzl09Fl_89IP=k-s128","display_name":"Mehmet Furkan &#199;ELİK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12148428/mehmet-furkan-%c3%87el%c4%b0k"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570116184,"creation_date":1569944968,"last_edit_date":1570106049,"question_id":58188372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188372","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a 3x3 hermitian matrix (named coh).

Here&#39;s a modified version that takes care of that:\r\n\r\n\r\n    return this.store.tx(&#39;create-tags&#39;, t =&gt; {\r\n        const res = tagDetails.map((tag: any) =&gt; {\r\n            return t.oneOrNone(`INSERT INTO tag(title) VALUES ($1) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING RETURNING tag_id, title`,\r\n                [tag.title],\r\n            )\r\n                .then((result: any) =&gt; {\r\n                    console.log(&#39;the tag details are&#39;, result);\r\n                    if (result !== null) {\r\n                        return this.createTags(collectionId, tag.item_id, result.tag_id);\r\n                    } else {\r\n                        return t.oneOrNone(`SELECT tag_id FROM tag WHERE title = $1`, [tag.title])\r\n                            .then((tagId: string) =&gt; {\r\n                                console.log(&#39;the tagid in else statement is&#39;, tagId);\r\n                                if (tagId) {\r\n                                    return this.createTags(collectionId, tag.item_id, tagId);\r\n                                }\r\n                            })\r\n                            .catch(err =&gt; {\r\n                                console.log(&#39;the error in else statement is&#39;, err);\r\n                            });\r\n                    }\r\n                });\r\n        });\r\n        return t.batch(res);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, this isn&#39;t particularly great, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n* You should rewrite it using fully `async` code\r\n* You should take error handling outside of the transaction\r\n* Your whole code looks like it can be replaced with just a single query.\r\n* We do not know what `createTags` does, so cannot comment on that\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188347/i-am-getting-error-querying-against-a-released-or-lost-connection-in-else-state/58194453#58194453","title":"I am getting error: Querying against a released or lost connection in else statement"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":8372625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/74f47c9fb710433031334441d7f47a75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Prashanti.D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8372625/prashanti-d"},"last_editor":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":56,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569989099,"creation_date":1569944878,"last_edit_date":1569949887,"question_id":58188347,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188347","body_markdown":"Here is the code, I am trying to check the result of insert statement.

When I run this program it is printing me product names and prices 15 times for the same page. I suspect the issue has something to do with local vs global variables, but I&#39;m quite new to programming, so still a bit confused.

If that answer gets updated to take this into account, I&#39;d be happy to remove this. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTypeScript doesn&#39;t know that `split()` will return a pair (a two-tuple). It only knows that it will return a `string[]`.  So the error is saying that `string[]` (what `split()` returns) might not have properties at the `0` and `1` keys that a pair does, and thus it isn&#39;t safe to assign it to your pair type.  \r\n\r\nIn the case where you know that what you are doing is safe (meaning you&#39;ve somehow already constrained `validation` to be a string with exactly one colon in it where the prefix is one of the keys of `validation`), you can use a [type assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#type-assertions):\r\n\r\n    const [validator, argument] = validation.split(&quot;:&quot;) as [\r\n      keyof typeof validators,\r\n      string\r\n    ]; // okay now\r\n\r\nType assertions will let you unsafely *narrow* the type of an expression, meaning you can tell the compiler that an expression is of a more specific type than it can verify.  The compiler knows that `validation.split()` returns a `string[]`, and you are asserting that it is specifically a `[keyof typeof validators, string]`, a subtype of `string[]`.\r\n\r\nDo note that type assertions allow you to lie to the compiler, and therefore the responsibility is on you not to do this.  If, at runtime, it turns out that `validation` has a different value from what you&#39;re expecting, then weird things will happen and the compiler cannot possibly help you avoid those.  If you want help avoiding those, then you will probably need to use [type guards](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-guards-and-differentiating-types) of some sort to actually verify that a `string[]` is of the pair type you expect.  If you are already doing this test somewhere, it might be worthwhile to rewrite this test in a form that the compiler perceives as a type guard.\r\n\r\n \r\nOkay, hope that helps; good luck!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188316/typescript-array-tuple-destructuring-specific-types-for-positions-using-keyof/58188924#58188924","title":"TypeScript array (tuple) destructuring specific types for positions using keyof typeof"}],"owner":{"reputation":919,"user_id":2230302,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0dc44fd7a1442dc10d055a39dca416c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dericcain","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2230302/dericcain"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570023093,"creation_date":1569944713,"question_id":58188316,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188316","body_markdown":"I have a string that I want to split and the result of the split string will be very specific, which I want to type:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [validator, argument]: [keyof typeof validators, string] = validation.split(&#39;:&#39;);\r\n```\r\nI know that the `validator` will be `keyof typeof validators` but I am getting an error in TS:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTS2739: Type &#39;string[]&#39; is missing the following properties from type &#39;[string | number, string]&#39;: 0, 1\r\n```\r\nWhat is it about this that TypeScript does not like?

After executing this logic, you fetch the doc (through the Admin SDK) and send back the result of the fetch to the front-end.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable\r\n  [2]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/read-and-write#save_data_as_transactions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188304/firebase-is-it-possible-to-execute-cloud-function-when-a-particular-document-i/58188749#58188749","title":"Firebase - Is it possible to execute cloud function when a particular document is read?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2015,"user_id":665961,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c9731997b08bd9e97209401fd2e9ba5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Haris ur Rehman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/665961/haris-ur-rehman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":281956,"user_id":209103,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/12d378e6a9788ab9c94bbafe242b82b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Frank van Puffelen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/209103/frank-van-puffelen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569954639,"accepted_answer_id":58188749,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569954590,"creation_date":1569944675,"last_edit_date":1569954590,"question_id":58188304,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188304","body_markdown":"I have a realtime database on Firebase.

I have previously done that in older versions of Svelte using the store, but I guess it&#39;s possible to do that without it.\r\n\r\nSupppose I have a board of herxagons SVG tiles.

At worst case I can zip and send by mail the src/routes and src/components sapper&#39;s folders !\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea to let me go on the right way ?\r\n\r\nRegards, hefeust.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188294/svelte-3-array-of-children-to-parent-communication-via-props","title":"Svelte 3 : array of children to parent communication via props"},{"tags":["jenkins","groovy","console-application","jenkins-groovy"],"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":10226260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1606187699500187/picture?type=large","display_name":"Gabriel Hardoim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10226260/gabriel-hardoim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":10,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569944610,"creation_date":1569944610,"question_id":58188291,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188291","body_markdown":"I have a list of workflow jobs thats contains the script: `println(&quot;hello&quot;);`\r\n\r\nAnd I can return, in string, the value of the scripts with the bellow code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (job in hudson.model.Hudson.instance.getView(nomeView).items) {\r\n  if (job.name.contains(&quot;myJobs&quot;)) {\r\n    script = job.getDefinition().getScript();\r\n    println(script);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nresult:\r\n```\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\n... number of jobs\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I not want only to get the script but modify it.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nscript = job.getDefinition().getScript();\r\njob.getDefinition().setScript(script + &quot;println(&quot;world&quot;);&quot;; //there are something like this?\r\nprintln(script);\r\n\r\n```\r\nI expect the result be this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;world&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;world&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;world&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;hello&quot;);\r\nprintln(&quot;world&quot;);\r\n... number of jobs\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188291/how-do-i-concatenate-a-script-in-a-workflow-job-by-script-console-in-jenkins","title":"how do I concatenate a script in a workflow job by script console in jenkins?"},{"tags":["reactjs","react-native","android-manifest"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":659,"user_id":10864356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/315465d723d17533b95c0615fd7201cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gkeenley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10864356/gkeenley"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569947015,"post_id":58188534,"comment_id":102757448,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188289/react-native-androidmanifest-xml-debug-vs-main/58188534#comment102757448_58188534"},{"owner":{"reputation":765,"user_id":4496128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f67253fb3e381452b43ad3815375835c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Radek Czemerys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4496128/radek-czemerys"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":659,"user_id":10864356,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/315465d723d17533b95c0615fd7201cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gkeenley","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10864356/gkeenley"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570009544,"post_id":58188534,"comment_id":102776191,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188289/react-native-androidmanifest-xml-debug-vs-main/58188534#comment102776191_58188534"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":765,"user_id":4496128,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f67253fb3e381452b43ad3815375835c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Radek Czemerys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4496128/radek-czemerys"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569945517,"creation_date":1569945517,"answer_id":58188534,"question_id":58188289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58188534","body_markdown":"`AndroidManifest` in the main directory will be used when you generate a release APK, `AndroidManifest` in the debug folder will add and/or replace things in the main `AndroidManifest` when running in dev mode.

The default directory is &lt;content_root&gt;/wwwroot. (...) The app&#39;s web host must be made aware of the content root directory. (...) Static files are accessible via a path relative to the web root. (...) The URI format to access a file in a subfolder is http://&lt;server_address&gt;/subfolder/&lt;file_name&gt;.\r\n\r\nusing the `app.UseStaticFiles()` will allow anyone to receive files from within your wwwroot directory.\r\n\r\nThis might satisfy your conditions. If it does not, because you might want to add authentication to receiving the file or return a different file from the same route based on a query parameter or the current user or you need to generate the file, you need to return the file from acontroller.\r\n\r\nReturning a file from a controller:\r\n\r\nthere isn&#39;t a lot of microsoft documentation on this, but there are a lot of Q&amp;A&#39;s on stackoverflow.\r\n\r\nCheckout: \r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5826649/returning-a-file-to-view-download-in-asp-net-mvc\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26038856/how-to-return-a-file-filecontentresult-in-asp-net-webapi/26041298\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n\r\npublic ActionResult DownloadFile()\r\n{\r\n    string filename = &quot;File.pdf&quot;;\r\n    string filepath = AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory + &quot;/Path/To/File/&quot; + filename;\r\n    byte[] filedata = System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(filepath);\r\n    string contentType = MimeMapping.GetMimeMapping(filepath);\r\n\r\n   var cd = new System.Net.Mime.ContentDisposition\r\n    {\r\n        FileName = filename,\r\n        Inline = true,\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    Response.AppendHeader(&quot;Content-Disposition&quot;, cd.ToString());\r\n\r\n    return File(filedata, contentType);\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of your problems also seems to be finding the file you want to return. \r\nYou can use `Server.MapPath(&quot;~/filename.ext&quot;)` for this. Make sure your file is included in your compiled project by selecting &#39;Copy if newer&#39; or &#39;Copy always&#39; in it&#39;s properties at &#39;Copy to Output Directory&#39;.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/AzXzb.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188286/dotnet-controller-to-return-static-file/58188829#58188829","title":"DotNet Controller to Return Static File"}],"owner":{"reputation":139,"user_id":3035659,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/603095741/picture?type=large","display_name":"faranak777","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3035659/faranak777"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569946733,"creation_date":1569944606,"question_id":58188286,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188286","body_markdown":"I am trying to tell the controller to return a static file in some condition.

difference is as follows:\r\n\r\n 1. [`ToObject&lt;T&gt;()`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/Overload_Newtonsoft_Json_Linq_JToken_ToObject.htm) is a **deserialization** operation.  It constructs a [`JsonSerializer`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_JsonSerializer.htm) and uses it to deserialize the current `JToken` to the desired type.  As such the token could be anything (a JSON array, a JSON object, or a JSON primitive value) and the serializer will, using reflection, try to deserialize the token to the desired type by reading through its contents with a [`JTokenReader`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_Linq_JTokenReader.htm).\r\n\r\n   This method is useful when writing generic code where the input token and output type could be anything.  It is the most general and fail-safe way to create a c# object from a `JToken`.\r\n\r\n 2. [`Extensions.Value&lt;U&gt;(IEnumerable&lt;JToken&gt;)`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/M_Newtonsoft_Json_Linq_Extensions_Value__1.htm) is a **conversion/casting** operation.  It attempts to convert the *value* of the current token to the target type by invoking [`Convert.ChangeType()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.convert.changetype) (as well as handling a few special cases).\r\n\r\n   This method is useful when you know your `JToken` is, in fact, a [`JValue`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/T_Newtonsoft_Json_Linq_JValue.htm) and you want to convert its [`Value`](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/P_Newtonsoft_Json_Linq_JValue_Value.htm) to a specific, required .Net primitive type.  For instance, if the `JValue` might contain a `long` or numeric string, you could convert it to an `int`, a `decimal` or a `double`.  If it might contain a `DateTime` or a string in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, you could convert it to a `DateTime`.  And any primitive JSON value can always converted to a string.\r\n\r\n   While this method is less general than `ToObject&lt;T&gt;()` it will be more performant in converting primitive values since the serializer invokes the same conversion methods internally when deserializing a primitive.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188277/difference-between-jtoken-toobjectt-vs-jtoken-valuet/58189038#58189038","title":"Difference between JToken.ToObject&lt;T&gt;() vs JToken.Value&lt;T&gt;()"}],"owner":{"reputation":915,"user_id":699850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da0e04f33a0b7cb7bd0e1feaf8c56632?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Darxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/699850/darxis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":915,"user_id":699850,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da0e04f33a0b7cb7bd0e1feaf8c56632?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Darxis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/699850/darxis"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58189038,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569948263,"creation_date":1569944564,"last_edit_date":1569945201,"question_id":58188277,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188277","body_markdown":"What is the difference between the `JToken.ToObject&lt;T&gt;()` method and the `JToken.Value&lt;T&gt;()` extension method (the one without the `key` parameter)?\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar jToken = JToken.Parse(&quot;123&quot;);\r\nvar toObjectStrResult = jToken.ToObject&lt;string&gt;();\r\nvar valueStrResult = jToken.Value&lt;string&gt;();\r\n// toObjectStrResult  == valueStrResult == &quot;123&quot;\r\n\r\nvar toObjectLongResult = jToken.ToObject&lt;long&gt;();\r\nvar valueLongResult = jToken.Value&lt;long&gt;();\r\n// toObjectLongResult  == valueLongResult  == 123L\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188277/difference-between-jtoken-toobjectt-vs-jtoken-valuet","title":"Difference between JToken.ToObject&lt;T&gt;() vs JToken.Value&lt;T&gt;()"},{"tags":["flutter","dart"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2897,"user_id":2179571,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2fcad62ab1dbdbe21b0956c80fdffa2c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"chunhunghan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2179571/chunhunghan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569997070,"post_id":58188275,"comment_id":102770606,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188275/how-to-map-response-body-to-multiple-list#comment102770606_58188275"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":51,"user_id":3297332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce36060beccac9bcb30dfe234548d6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephan Thierry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3297332/stephan-thierry"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570006072,"creation_date":1570006072,"answer_id":58198173,"question_id":58188275,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58198173","body_markdown":"You are most likely missing some null validation in you model class.

The [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.stream.readasync?view=netcore-3.0#System_IO_Stream_ReadAsync_System_Memory_System_Byte__System_Threading_CancellationToken_) have a method to read into a `Span&lt;byte&gt;` (`Read`) and an async method to read into a `Memory&lt;byte&gt;` (`ReadAsync`). With the synchronous method, a `Span&lt;T&gt;` can be reinterpret casted to a `Span&lt;byte&gt;` with `MemoryMarshal.AsBytes`.

So my `Dockerfile` now looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\nRUN apk update &amp;&amp; apk upgrade &amp;&amp; \\\r\n  apk add --no-cache \\\r\n  chromium\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use-case for me is to build [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com/) app and test it against Chrome in *headless* mode.\r\n\r\nBefore this change my `Dockerfile` that was not longer working for me was:\r\n\r\n```\r\nRUN apk update &amp;&amp; apk upgrade &amp;&amp; \\\r\n  echo @edge http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/community &gt;&gt; /etc/apk/repositories &amp;&amp; \\\r\n  echo @edge http://nl.alpinelinux.org/alpine/edge/main &gt;&gt; /etc/apk/repositories &amp;&amp; \\\r\n  apk add --no-cache \\\r\n  git \\\r\n  chromium@edge \\\r\n  nss@edge \\\r\n  freetype@edge \\\r\n  harfbuzz@edge &amp;&amp; \\\r\n  rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \\\r\n  /var/cache/apk/* \\\r\n  /usr/share/man \\\r\n  /tmp/*\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the error was:\r\n```\r\n            Error: Browser exited unexpectedly\r\n            Non-zero exit code: 127\r\n            Stderr: \r\n             Error relocating /usr/lib/chromium/chrome: _ZNSt7__cxx1118basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev: symbol not found\r\n            Error relocating /usr/lib/chromium/chrome: _ZNSt7__cxx1119basic_ostringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev: symbol not found\r\n            Error relocating /usr/lib/chromium/chrome: _ZNSt19_Sp_make_shared_tag5_S_eqERKSt9type_info: symbol not found\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188230/headless-chrome-in-docker-symbol-not-found-error-after-latest-update/58265347#58265347","title":"Headless chrome in Docker &quot;symbol not found&quot; error after latest update"}],"owner":{"reputation":119,"user_id":3330979,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03e9233dfcce26e31e765f2e53d4f4df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chrispytoes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3330979/chrispytoes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":119,"user_id":3330979,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03e9233dfcce26e31e765f2e53d4f4df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"chrispytoes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3330979/chrispytoes"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":170,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570434300,"creation_date":1569944406,"last_edit_date":1570031506,"question_id":58188230,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188230","body_markdown":"I have a Docker container that I&#39;ve been using for quite some time for a node application which depends on headless chrome.

(In the case of &quot;3&quot; for example, returning the value &quot;0&quot;, as it comes from the 0th element array within the nestedArrays). How would I go about this the simplest or most efficiently?**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a few ways to make this work, such as:\r\n\r\n1) Converting the existing nested array to a pair of values for each nested value containing both the value itself and the nested array&#39;s index within the parent array. Easy but duplicate data, creating an intermediary array, and extra forEach loops:\r\n\r\n    var nestedArrays2 = [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0],[3,0],[4,1],[5,1],[6,1],[7,2],[8,2],[9,2]];\r\n\r\nThen, similarly flatten it, however this will result in:\r\n\r\n    [0,0,1,0,2,0,3,0,4,1,5,1,6,1,7,2,8,2,9,2]\r\n\r\nwhich can be filtered through for odd values as well, all in all:\r\n\r\n    merged = flatten(nestedArrays2).filter((num, index) =&gt; {\r\n      return index % 2 !== 0;\r\n    })\r\n\r\nThus in this case, I know `nestedArrays2[merged[i]][1]` will return the index of the original nested Array the value at `merged[i]` was in when it as in `nestedArrays`. \r\n\r\n1a) Branching off the previous but with the same general idea, a separate array can be created with no change to the original `nestedArrays`. Since we&#39;re looping through it already, we might as well take the time to flatten it in the same iteration.\r\n\r\n    var merged = [];\r\n    var nestIndexes = [];\r\n    nestedArrays.forEach((element,index){\r\n      element.forEach((e) {\r\n        merged.push(e);\r\n        nestIndexes.push(index);\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n\r\nThis would result in both merged and nestedIndexes such as below:\r\n\r\n    merged [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]\r\n    nestedIndexes [0,0,0,0,1,1,1,3,3,3]\r\n\r\nThus, if I get the `index` of a value in `merged`, I can immediately get the equivalent value from `nestedIndexes` with `nestedIndexes[index]`\r\n\r\n2) Keeping a separate index reference array\r\n\r\nI was thinking perhaps I could keep a separate array that marks index positions in which the nested arrays start, before merging the nested arrays. Simply loop through `nestedArrays`, get `length` for each element and add to the previous value such that it will be cumulative:\r\n\r\n    var nestPositions = [];\r\n    nestedArrays.forEach((element, index) {\r\n      nestPositions[index] = (element.length + (nestedArrays[index - 1] || 0) -1); //for when index is 0\r\n    })\r\n\r\nSo, nestPositions will be:\r\n\r\n    [3,6,9]\r\n\r\nthe index of the last element at each nested array in `nestedArrays`.\r\n\r\nBut in this case, after I get `merged[i]`, I would have to loop over nestPositions array each time to see if less than or equal to i and break, for each element to check.\r\n\r\n3) Creating a map with nested array index from `nestedArrays`.\r\n\r\n    nestMap = new Map();\r\n    nestedArrays.forEach((element, index) =&gt; {\r\n      nestMap.set(index, element);\r\n    })\r\n\r\nI could then get merged as normal, and to get the nested array index of the element from `merged[i]`, I could I suppose, do a forEach on the map, like this:\r\n\r\n    nestMap.forEach((value, key) =&gt; {\r\n      if (value.includes(merged[i]) return key;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnyhow, that&#39;s the methods I can think off the top of my head. Which one is the best, are there any better more concise ways of approaching this? Either way, appreciate any help, or even simply for reaching this part haha.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, providing\r\n&gt; callbacks where the data will be delivered to.\r\n\r\nAn observable can send three types of notifications: `Next`, `Error`, `Complete`.\r\n\r\n- `Next` notification sends a value such as a *Number*, a *String*, an *Object*, etc.\r\n\r\n- `Error` notification sends a JavaScript Error or exception.\r\n\r\n- `Complete` notification does not send a value.\r\n\r\nAnd in `subscribe()` method we provide three callbacks to receive these three types of notifications. Order of the callbacks matter, they correspond to `Next`, `Error`, and `Complete` in order.\r\n\r\nIn the code below, the parameter `next` in the first callback can be named anything, its name doesn&#39;t have any significance.\r\n\r\n    this.authService.login(this.model).subscribe(next =&gt; {\r\n      this.alertService.success(&#39;Logged in successfully&#39;);\r\n    });\r\n    \r\n\r\nWhen there is no parameter in first callback, we aren&#39;t capturing the values sent from the observable. We can ignore having a parameter when we are only concerned with knowing that a value is sent but don&#39;t care about the actual value sent.\r\n\r\n    this.authService.login(this.model).subscribe(() =&gt; {\r\n          this.alertService.success(&#39;Logged in successfully&#39;);\r\n          this.router.navigate([&#39;/home&#39;]);\r\n        }, error =&gt; {\r\n          this.alertService.danger(error);\r\n        });\r\n\r\nIn above code snippet, we won&#39;t receive the values sent but the alert is triggered whenever a value is sent. Here we don&#39;t have the third callback, so we won&#39;t be notified when the observable completes.\r\n\r\n**When is it more appropriate to use next vs complete for my observable?**\r\n\r\n- Use the first callback to receive values from an observable.\r\n\r\n- Use second callback for handling any errors.\r\n\r\n- Use third callback to perform any tasks when the observable completes.\r\n\r\nAlso note that `Error` and `Complete` notifications may happen only once during the observable execution, and there can only be either one of them. So when there is an error, the third callback won&#39;t be called.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/guide/observable#subscribing-to-observables\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188199/angular-using-the-observable-complete-vs-next-handler-and-when-to-use-each-appro/58189082#58189082","title":"Angular using the observable complete vs next handler and when to use each appropriately"}],"owner":{"reputation":2480,"user_id":1186050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1aeaf46e73772e9f9c7784bf0ee0705c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1186050","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1186050/user1186050"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2480,"user_id":1186050,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1aeaf46e73772e9f9c7784bf0ee0705c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1186050","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1186050/user1186050"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":54,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58189082,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570040240,"creation_date":1569944268,"last_edit_date":1569945245,"question_id":58188199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188199","body_markdown":"Question - based on the [Angular doc][1], when is it more appropriate to use next vs complete for my observable?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking through someones Angular 7 project and I see a lot of code that looks like this below where some calls use next and some just use complete and I&#39;m trying to know when to use the appropriate one based on the [Angular doc][1], because next is &#39;required&#39;

connector-ref = &quot;default&quot; security-realm = &quot;ApplicationRealm&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/subsystem&gt;\r\n\r\nIn this case, verify the configuration of your ejb client.\r\nYou should have a file named *jboss-ejb-client.properties* (It should be located in the *src/main/resources* folder).\r\nTake in account to disable some configurations:\r\n\r\n - SASL_POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT\r\n - SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n### *Jboss-ejb-client.properties* example:\r\n\r\n    endpoint.name = client-endpoint\r\n    remote.connectionprovider.create.options.org.xnio.Options.SSL_ENABLED = false\r\n    remote.connections = default\r\n    remote.connection.default.host = 127.0.0.1\r\n    remote.connection.default.port = 8080\r\n    remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOPLAINTEXT = false\r\n    remote.connection.default.connect.options.org.xnio.Options.SASL_POLICY_NOANONYMOUS = false\r\n    remote.connection.default.username = username\r\n    remote.connection.default.password = password\r\n\r\nReplace in the above example the connection host, port and the user credentials.\r\n\r\n&gt; In this example, the connection is not encrypted but it can have SSL\r\n&gt; enabled too.\r\n\r\nTake into account that if the connection requires authentication, you need to add a user to your WildFly via the add-user.sh (or add-user.bat) script.\r\n\r\nYou can also try to replace your ejb remote access with a local one (@Local instead of @Remote).\r\n\r\nI hope this helps, otherwise try to share a sample reproducer (eg github) and I will try to help you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58188194/using-keycloak-for-wildfly-applications-authentication-error/58212118#58212118","title":"Using Keycloak for Wildfly Applications - Authentication Error"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":9260993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/599bf97faebab68467c9eaae3fb2d9ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"znkomurcu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9260993/znkomurcu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21,"user_id":9260993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/599bf97faebab68467c9eaae3fb2d9ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"znkomurcu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9260993/znkomurcu"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570075155,"creation_date":1569944248,"last_edit_date":1570008748,"question_id":58188194,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58188194","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a plugin for Keycloak which basically a Wildfly application itself. \r\nWhen I try to deploy the application to running Keycloak, I&#39;m getting the following error:\r\n\r\n```[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.wildfly.plugins:wildfly-maven-plugin:2.0.1.Final:deploy (default-cli) on project magic-link: Failed to execute goal deploy.: java.net.ConnectException: WFLYPRT0053: Could not connect to remote+http://localhost:9990.
