Since multiplication is commutative, we don&#39;t need to look at both, say, `21*34` and `34*21`.  Hence the inner loop can stop at `x` rather than go all the way down to `0`.  This halves the execution time.\r\n\r\n2. String operations are expensive.  If, having computed the product, we see that it&#39;s not larger than the largest palindrome we&#39;ve seen so far, there&#39;s no point in even checking whether it is a palindrome itself.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301171/fastest-algorithm-to-find-the-largest-palindrome-that-is-the-product-of-2-number/58302033#58302033","title":"Fastest algorithm to find the largest palindrome that is the product of 2 numbers with the same number of digits"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1742,"user_id":5413565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/894453243963871/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mushif Ali Nawaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5413565/mushif-ali-nawaz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1742,"user_id":5413565,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/894453243963871/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mushif Ali Nawaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5413565/mushif-ali-nawaz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570621234,"last_edit_date":1570621234,"creation_date":1570618976,"answer_id":58302709,"question_id":58301171,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58302709","body_markdown":"This is a fast and efficient algorithm (based on mathematical calculations): \r\n\r\n    def palindrome(maxInt):\r\n        largest_palindrome = 9\r\n        digit_count = len(str(maxInt))\r\n        a = maxInt\r\n        while a &gt;= 10**(digit_count-1):\r\n            if a % 11 == 0:\r\n                b = maxInt\r\n                divided_by = 1\r\n            else:\r\n                b = maxInt - maxInt % 11\r\n                divided_by = 11\r\n    \r\n            while b &gt;= a:\r\n                if a * b &lt;= largest_palindrome:\r\n                    break\r\n                prod = a * b\r\n                str_num = str(prod)\r\n                if str_num == str_num[::-1]:\r\n                    largest_palindrome = prod\r\n    \r\n                b = b - divided_by\r\n            a = a - 1\r\n        return largest_palindrome\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\nIt gives the result in a fraction of a second.

So I searched some documents of HDFS and I&#39;m afraid that you can&#39;t control mutual exclusion of reading and writing directly. Please see below documents:\r\n\r\n1.link1: https://www.raviprak.com/research/hadoop/leaseManagement.html\r\n\r\n&gt; writers must obtain an exclusive lock for a file before they’d be\r\n&gt; allowed to write / append / truncate data in those files. Notably,\r\n&gt; this exclusive lock does NOT prevent other clients from reading the\r\n&gt; file, (so a client could be writing a file, and at the same time\r\n&gt; another could be reading the same file).\r\n\r\n2.link2: https://blog.cloudera.com/understanding-hdfs-recovery-processes-part-1/\r\n\r\nBefore a client can write an HDFS file, it must obtain a lease, which is essentially a lock. This ensures the single-writer semantics. The lease must be renewed within a predefined period of time if the client wishes to keep writing. If a lease is not explicitly renewed or the client holding it dies, then it will expire. When this happens, HDFS will close the file and release the lease on behalf of the client so that other clients can write to the file. This process is called lease recovery.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI provide a workaround here for your reference: Adding a Redis database before your writes and reads!\r\n\r\nNo matter when you do read or write operations, firstly please judge whether there is a specific key in the Redis database.

Finally don&#39;t forget to delete the key.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is may a little bit cumbersome or affecting performance, I think it can meet your needs.

In PowerShell I use TaskKill to kill Explorer.exe, Sleep for 10 seconds so the icon cache DB files are no longer in use, then delete them and restart Explorer.exe with Start-Process. I am also using a VBScript to launch the PowerShell script as I want this to happen transparently to the user.\r\nThe final implementation involves running everything by way of the Run key in the Windows registry. That triggers my script that has a mechanism for running this only once, but for every user who logs on to the machine.\r\nThe problem SEEMS to be that killing Explorer.exe also kills the script that was launched via Run, so it never has a chance to write to the registry in Current User that this task has completed. Thus Explorer.exe is restarted on every single logon, which is not desirable.\r\n\r\nIs this a known interaction between Explorer.exe and things launched via the Run key?

and you feed that in to the code above, then it will generate a unique code you can use without needing to store the mapping between that SKU and that unique code (also known as &quot;content-based addressing&quot;).\r\n\r\n...so if you come across another $10 worth of apples that also expire on 2019-10-09, then it will have the same unique code, even though it&#39;s a different object, and you didn&#39;t need to memorize that unique code you generated earlier.\r\n\r\nBut if you come across $10 worth of pears that expires on 2019-10-09, or $20 worth of apples that also expires on the same day, the&#39;ll have a different code.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301122/generating-ids-for-items-in-an-inventory-system/58301193#58301193","title":"Generating IDs for

could create the ID by concatenating all of the information together as a big string or even hashing that string.\r\n\r\nHowever this can still give you duplicates if all of that information is that same several times. There doesn&#39;t seem to be any need on using the existing information to generate the ID. If you are basing it on existing data then there will always be a chance of duplicates. Unless there is some sort of constraint on one of the fields requiring that to be unique. But if that&#39;s unique then you could just use that as an ID in the first place.\r\n\r\nIf you are storing this data in a database I would suggest creating an ID field and make that the primary key and give it an identity.

The goal is: the user is authenticated (silently like explained [in the Microsoft example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/authentication/auth-silent-aad), a static html page with the JavaScript code is hosted in an Azure Storage), then my custom web service is called and answers with a SharePoint-Online URL which contains an SPFX Webpart. Then the user is redirected to that page. When the user is not registered he gets an error page instead. The problem here is, that I am not able to redirect the user to that SharePoint page. The SharePoint page won&#39;t open in the iframe of the Teams tab because the tab&#39;s domain is the domain where my static web page is hosted. So my first question is how can I achieve this? (I do not know the SharePoint URL at build time, i do not know if the user has a page at all. This is determined in the custom web service at runtime)\r\n\r\nA different approach would be to build a custom JavaScript application (in react, like my SPFX webpart), host it on my static web page and communicate with the SharePoint from there. To test my idea I added permissions for SharePoint in my Azure AD application, wrote a simple call to the SharePoint with the obtained token.\r\n\r\n    var req = new XMLHttpRequest();\r\n    req.open(&quot;GET&quot;, &quot;https://[tenant].sharepoint.com/sites/[sitecollection]/_api/web/lists&quot;, false);\r\n    req.setRequestHeader(&quot;Authorization&quot;, &quot;Bearer &quot; + idToken);\r\n    req.setRequestHeader(&quot;Accept&quot;, &quot;application/json;odata=verbose&quot;);\r\n    req.onreadystatechange = function () {\r\n          if (req.readyState == 4 &amp;&amp; req.status == 200) {\r\n              var result = JSON.parse(req.responseText);\r\n          }\r\n    };\r\n    req.send();\r\n\r\nThe problem is my SharePoint is answering with 401 and &quot;Exception of type &#39;Microsoft.IdentityModel.Tokens.AudienceUriValidationFailedException&#39; was thrown&quot; error in the response.\r\n\r\nIs this some sort of CORS problem or do I need a different type of token for SharePoint? Or do I have to use a complete different JavaScript library to authenticate vs SharePoint.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301102/teams-tab-for-dynamic-sharepoint-page-authentication-problem","title":"Teams Tab for dynamic SharePoint page / authentication problem"},{"tags":["reactjs","typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8739,"user_id":1525495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/imb0b.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jorge Fuentes Gonz&#225;lez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1525495/jorge-fuentes-gonz%c3%a1lez"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570613632,"post_id":58301101,"comment_id":102964867,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301101/can-t-dynamically-setstate-in-react-typescript#comment102964867_58301101"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":592,"user_id":6677742,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bMUAo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ibtsam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6677742/ibtsam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570614084,"creation_date":1570614084,"answer_id":58301295,"question_id":58301101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58301295","body_markdown":"I think maybe you are missing something \r\nThis works\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n    console.log(this.state.mostPopContentCount);\r\n    const name = &quot;mostPopContentCount&quot;;\r\n    return (\r\n      &lt;a\r\n        href=&quot;javascript:void(0)&quot;\r\n        onClick={() =&gt;

Thus, `w != 0.2` returns `[True False True True]`\r\n\r\nThus\r\n\r\n- for a `list`, `w[w!=0.2]` is `w[True]` and this is treated as meaning `w[1]`\r\n\r\n- for an `ndarray` it is `w[ ndarray([True False True True]) ]` which then leverages numpy’s array indexing to return only those elements where the Boolean is `True`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301100/why-asarray-and-list-react-diffently/58301412#58301412","title":"Why asarray and list react diffently?"}],"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":7986756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c0455a1c66e47c72df5e1eaef541dfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NanBlanc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7986756/nanblanc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":41,"user_id":7986756,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c0455a1c66e47c72df5e1eaef541dfd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"NanBlanc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7986756/nanblanc"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58301412,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570614773,"creation_date":1570613465,"last_edit_date":1570614202,"question_id":58301100,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301100","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to understand why : \r\n\r\n     w=[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0]\r\n     print(w[w!=0])\r\n\r\noutputs : `0.2`,\r\n\r\nwhile \r\n\r\n     w=[0.1,0.2,0.3,0.5,0]\r\n     w=np.asarray(w)\r\n     print(w[w!=0])\r\n\r\noutputs : `[0.1 0.2 0.3 0.5]`, which seems more logical\r\n\r\nSo : why lists do return the second element ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301100/why-asarray-and-list-react-diffently","title":"Why asarray and list react diffently?"},{"tags":["laravel","pdf","mpdf"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3648,"user_id":5260982,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yZtIq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5260982/dave"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570619991,"post_id":58301098,"comment_id":102968194,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301098/cannot-find-ttf-truetype-font-file-shabnam-ttf-in-configured-font-directories#comment102968194_58301098"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9018206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XVh8Xv1ByCk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/fcMPvuk9tE4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ezatullah Tabish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9018206/ezatullah-tabish"},"last_editor":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9018206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XVh8Xv1ByCk/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAEA/fcMPvuk9tE4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ezatullah Tabish","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9018206/ezatullah-tabish"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570614183,"creation_date":1570613456,"last_edit_date":1570614183,"question_id":58301098,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301098","body_markdown":"Works at Local Hosts\r\nI uploaded my project to a shared host\r\nAnd it doesn&#39;t work in shared hosting\r\n\r\n**pdf class**\r\n\r\n    &lt;?php\r\n\r\n    return [\r\n    &#39;mode&#39;

In either case, Angular will be notified of the event and will react accordingly.\r\n\r\nA clean solution would have been possible if the `RouterLink` directive had a `exportAs` attribute. In that case, it would have been possible to control the `RouterLink` from a custom directive. Unfortunately, that is not the case ([RouterLink source][1])\r\n\r\nThe only option left is to extend the `RouterLinkWithHref` directive like this:\r\n\r\n    @Directive({\r\n      selector: &quot;a[myRouterLink],area[myRouterLink]&quot;\r\n    })\r\n    export class MyDirective extends RouterLinkWithHref implements OnChanges {\r\n      @Input()\r\n      myRouterLink;\r\n    \r\n      @Input()\r\n      myDisabled;\r\n    \r\n      constructor(\r\n        private myRouter: Router,\r\n        private myRoute: ActivatedRoute,\r\n        private myLocationStrategy: LocationStrategy,\r\n        private host: ElementRef\r\n      ) {\r\n        super(myRouter, myRoute, myLocationStrategy);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      ngOnChanges() {\r\n        if (this.myDisabled) {\r\n          this.host.nativeElement.setAttribute(&quot;disabled&quot;, &quot;disabled&quot;);\r\n          this.routerLink = null;\r\n        } else {\r\n          this.host.nativeElement.removeAttribute(&quot;disabled&quot;);\r\n          this.routerLink = this.myRouterLink;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nThis gives the following markup: `&lt;a myRouterLink=&quot;a&quot; [myDisabled]=&quot;disabled&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;`\r\n\r\nNote that for a full working solution, you would have to also extend `RouterLink`\r\n\r\nYou can try the demo here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-p2w4ff\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/directives/router_link.ts","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301088/disabling-routerlink-with-stopimmediatepropogation-method/58352841#58352841","title":"Disabling routerLink with stopImmediatePropogation method"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":645,"user_id":6118550,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhJIt.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"C_Ogoo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6118550/c-ogoo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570883690,"creation_date":1570883690,"answer_id":58354226,"question_id":58301088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58354226","body_markdown":"Im not sure I fully grok what the question is asking.

At first I thought maybe the difference was due to move creating one temporary object which might malloc by default or something, that will be the result of function like `result = func_returns_move(...)` but it should be constant time which is not the case here.

Problem is, I cant get it to work.\r\nI will try to be more specific. I read about bean validation. And there seems to be annotations like @Size and @NotNull and so on.\r\n\r\nAccording to: https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/bean-validation001.htm#GKAGK\r\nThere are built in constraints. Annotations of that sort. &quot;Great!&quot; I thought. Its built in, should just work :). Nope. sayes &quot;Size cannot be resolved to a type&quot; in Eclipse. \r\nDespite it being &quot;built in&quot; i think it might be part of the JavaEE specification, and thus  there is some actual implementations out there. Seems hibernate.validate is one, does apache have one? I dont want to use maven though. Seems overkill when all I want to do is one simple @Size.\r\n\r\nThere also seems to be a need to add several jars. And they are called different things. Not shure if Im looking at the correct place, but think I found something at \r\nhttp://hibernate.org/validator/releases/6.0/\r\nBut there are different versions\r\nlike:\r\n\r\n - hibernate-validator\r\n - hibernate-validator-cdi\r\n - hibernate-validator-osgi\r\n - hibernate-validator-annotation-processor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich ones of these do I need? where to put them in Eclipse? I tried to put the annotation-processor one to:\r\nFile-&gt;BuildPath-&gt;ConfigureBuildPath-&gt;JavaCompiler-&gt;AnnotationProcessing-&gt;FactoryPath.\r\nI really googled a lot, and yes there is a lot on annotations. basics, as well as beanvalidation. And they all make it seem so simple, but cant find exactly HOW to actually make them work.\r\nJust installed Tomcat not to long ago. And there was lots of detailed info out there on exactly HOW to download, install and run. Once running I got sort of a running start and learned more :).\r\nI guess Im looking for something like that for beanvalidation. But its hard when you cant even get a basic experiment to work :-/.\r\n\r\n**Short version:**\r\nHow do I make bean validation work? To be able to use the &quot;built in&quot; annotations as per link above? What do I need? where do I download it from? where do I put it?\r\n\r\nI use Eclipse with JRE 1.8.0_122 set as default in Preferences-&gt;Java-&gt;InstalledJRE&#39;s.\r\nI tried with JRE in JDK10.0.2 as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample of usage:\r\n```Java\r\npublic class ToValidate {\r\n\r\n\t@Size(min=2, max=10)\r\n\tprivate String name;\r\n\r\n\tpublic ToValidate() {\r\n\t\t// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic void writeString(String name) {\r\n\t\tSystem.out.println(this.name);\r\n\t}\r\n\t\r\n\tpublic void setName(String name) {\r\n\t\tthis.name = name;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nEdit after request.\r\nSimple as said. And @**Size** is underlined with red in eclipse and when hovering over it, it says: &quot;Size cannot be resolved to a type&quot;\r\nI tried to import javax.validation.constraints since it mentions that in the link. But I guess I need to import something from hibernate since they implement it. But what? where? how?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301021/how-to-use-size-annotation","title":"How to use @Size annotation"},{"tags":["ibm-midrange","jt400"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":10678833,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/626ce495b51bde3280faed549973c49c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bashdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10678833/bashdi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570688619,"post_id":58307099,"comment_id":102993283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301020/jt400-uses-quser-is-there-a-way-to-change-this/58307099#comment102993283_58307099"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8979,"user_id":2296441,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sf28F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmarkmurphy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2296441/jmarkmurphy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8979,"user_id":2296441,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sf28F.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmarkmurphy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2296441/jmarkmurphy"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":true,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1570646619,"last_edit_date":1570646619,"creation_date":1570633430,"answer_id":58307099,"question_id":58301020,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58307099","body_markdown":"That depends on which User ID field the program is using. It probably is using the one at position 254. That is part of the qualified job name, and cannot be changed.

Even if you changed that to your user profile, assuming your user profile had appropriate authority, then every job would be started with your user profile, and not the one that signed in to the ODBC/JDBC connection.\r\n\r\nThe only fix is to use the correct field.

When it starts up, and before anyone has connected to it, `Current user profile` is QUSER.

The view aggregates information from many other tables and when there is an update in any one of them the High Watermark needs to be incremented. We already have a Created and Updated property in all tables, this field can be used as watermark, meaning we only have to find the highest value in any related &#39;Created&#39; or &#39;Updated&#39; columns.\r\n\r\nIn the database the Employer table has a one-to-many relation to many properties, for this example two are relevant: the payrollSoftware table and the employments. An employer only has one active payroll software package, therefore we can reduce this many-to-one to a one-to-one relation by getting the latest. Because of regulations we still need to keep the old one. \r\n\r\nFor this one-to-one relation, getting the highest value from different columns us done with the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(SELECT MAX(newest)\r\nFROM (VALUES (employer.Updated), (payroll.Updated), (payroll.Created), (employer.Created)) as value(newest)) \r\nas UpdatedAt \r\n```\r\n\r\nSadly, this doesn&#39;t work for the one-to-many relation. The first intuition would be to use ```(Max(employments.Created))``` in the values but that isn&#39;t allowed. I&#39;ve tried a sub-query but couldn&#39;t figure out how to get the outcome into the VALUES. \r\n\r\nThe full query:\r\n``` \r\nCREATE VIEW FullEmployer AS\r\nSELECT employer.Id, employer.Name as EmployerName, employer.Active, COUNT(employments.CustomerId) as Employees, payroll.Name as PayrollName,\r\n       employer.PhoneNumber, employer.City, employer.Email,\r\n       (SELECT MAX(newest)\r\n        FROM (VALUES (employer.Updated), (payroll.Updated), (payroll.Created), (employer.Created)) as value(newest)) as UpdatedAt\r\nFROM DB.Employers AS employer\r\n         LEFT OUTER JOIN DB.PayrollSoftware payroll ON employer.PayrollSoftwareId = payroll.Id\r\n         LEFT OUTER JOIN DB.PayrollSoftware payroll2 On employer.PayrollSoftwareId = payroll2.Id AND\r\n                                                              (payroll.Created &lt; payroll2.Created OR (payroll.Created = payroll2.Created AND payroll.Id &lt; payroll2.Id))\r\n         LEFT OUTER JOIN DB.Employments employments ON employer.Id = employments.EmployerId\r\nWHERE payroll2.Id IS NULL AND\r\n        employments.Active = 1\r\ngroup by employer.Id, payroll.Name, employer.Name, employer.Active, employer.Updated, payroll.Updated, payroll.Created,\r\n         employer.Created, employer.PhoneNumber, employer.City, employer.Email\r\n``` \r\n\r\n**The question:** Is there a better way to do this? If not, how do we get the MAX value of any Updated or Created column of the employers&#39; related entities?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301017/get-high-watermark-information-of-one-to-many-related-entities","title":"Get High Watermark information of one-to-many related

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,\r\n\r\nWhile it seems unimportant, this actually gives us a small optimization: reverse the search.\r\n\r\nUsing the forward method for your given inputs there are 3 comparisons done to find the answer:\r\n\r\n    [0, 1] =&gt; 3 + 2 != 6\r\n    [0, 2] =&gt; 3 + 4 != 6\r\n    [1, 2] =&gt; 2 + 4 == 6\r\n\r\nFor each pass through the outer loop the number of passes through the inner loop decreases.  Unless the answer includes the first item in the array that means that you&#39;re testing more than you need to.\r\n\r\nIf we reverse the search we eliminate pairs from each outer loop faster:\r\n\r\n\tstatic int[] TwoSums(int target, int[] array)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tfor (int i1 = array.Length - 2; i1 &gt;= 0; i1--)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tint v1 = array[i1];\r\n\t\t\tfor (int i2 = i1 + 1; i2 &lt; array.Length; i2++)\r\n\t\t\t{\r\n\t\t\t\tif (v1 + array[i2] == target)\r\n\t\t\t\t\treturn new[] { i1, i2 };\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn null;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThis way the sequence for your example is:\r\n\r\n    [1, 2] =&gt; 2 + 4 == 6\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s a little bit of a cheat though, since the answer in this case is the last pair.  Let&#39;s try something different and compare:\r\n\r\n    Array: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31]\r\n    Test value: 24\r\n\r\nWith a little instrumentation we can see how many times we run through the loop.  For this particular case the forward search does 22 comparisons before it finds the one that works while the reverse does only 11.  If the test value were 48 (19 + 29) the numbers would be: Forward=49, Reverse=5.\r\n\r\nOf course if the answer includes one of the first couple of values then the numbers flip.  It&#39;s a game of averages.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58301014/how-do-i-get-my-twosum-method-to-work-with-numbers-that-arent-in-order/58304264#58304264","title":"How do I get my TwoSum method to work with numbers that aren&#39;t in order?"}],"owner":{"reputation":42,"user_id":9960529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gUagPe5FRkQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AB6qoq0YJjDq4IsjoWUnI6AWvOnozo7aBg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Grace Delos Reyes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9960529/grace-delos-reyes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":576,"user_id":5324133,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/c2U3e.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stefan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5324133/stefan"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58301272,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570624543,"creation_date":1570613171,"last_edit_date":1570614951,"question_id":58301014,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58301014","body_markdown":"I&#39;m currently working on a LeetCode question called TwoSums.\r\n\r\nIt requires me to:\r\n&gt;Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target. \r\n\r\n&gt;You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy code works with different lengths of arrays.
