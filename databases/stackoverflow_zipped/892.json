It&#39;s for invoicing. I can&#39;t seem to generate the file correctly.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m matching a working .iif test file with the one I&#39;m generated. I&#39;ve inspected the working file with vim and found the tab delimiters, with an `^M` carriage return.  I&#39;ve tried to write each row and put that into an array, to be joined together as a string with an `\\n` newline. The file successfully imports into Quickbooks, but I can&#39;t find the invoice after Quickbooks prompts the successful invoice message.\r\n\r\nit&#39;s basically like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nformatInvoiceRows = () =&gt;

anyone found a useful example for learning mapreduce that goes beyond the typical word/item count example in introducing mapreduce? Or something that is even it be more complete then the word/item count example?\r\n\r\nSo far just from reading, I have gotten a little confused:\r\n - So for mapreduce you need to do 4 things 1) Load the data, 2) Map the Data, then 3) Reduce the data\r\n\r\n - it seems like Map reduce requires us to map first before we reduce\r\n\r\n - Doing mapping requires us to go from here &lt;src tgt weight&gt; &lt;10 110 3&gt; to here &lt;src tgt-weight&gt; &lt;10 110-3&gt;  \r\n\r\n - Then we do some &quot;reduce&quot; or math source and target values, so we need to break apart this &quot;mapped&quot; structure back to the original structure.\r\n\r\n - However, then we output it in the map structure?  \r\n\r\nI feel like I might be able to figure this out if I had better example of how map reduce works. \r\n\r\nP.S. I have set up a virtual environment with Hadoop, Java, and Maven.

guess is that this is Protobuf encoded data.  You can see by looking at the Javascript source code for the yahoo finance page, once a ticker has been subscribed, the replies are handled by a decoding routine.\r\n\r\nhttps://finance.yahoo.com/__finStreamer-worker.js \r\n\r\n... in following snippet, there is a clear conversion from the base64 text to bytes and then to a Javascript object (of type PricingData).

But it&#39;s easier to come to this conclusion if you think of the image building process a bit.\r\n\r\nDockerfile is just a way to describe a sequence of commands to be executed by Docker build subsystem to create an image. And an image is just a bunch of regular files, most notably, user land files of a particular Linux distribution, but possibly with some extra files on top of it. Every Docker image is based on the parent image and adds its own files to the parent&#39;s set. Every image has to start FROM something, i.e. specify its parent. And the parent of all parents is a `scratch` image defined as `noop`, i.e. an empty set of files.\r\n\r\nTake a look at [`busybox`][1] image:\r\n\r\n    FROM scratch\r\n    ADD busybox.tar.xz /\r\n    CMD [&quot;sh&quot;]\r\n\r\nIt starts from scratch, i.e. an empty set of files, and adds (i.e. copies) to this set a bunch of files from [`busybox.tar.xz`][2] archive. \r\n\r\nNow, if you want to create your own image, you can start from `busybox` image and describe what files (and how) you are going to add:\r\n\r\n    FROM busybox:latest\r\n\r\n    ADD myfile.txt /\r\n\r\nBut every time a new image has to start FROM something.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/docker-library/busybox/blob/04f6ab4f9c7ae51402cf5bfda84fadf30353d8ed/uclibc/Dockerfile#L1\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/docker-library/busybox/blob/04f6ab4f9c7ae51402cf5bfda84fadf30353d8ed/uclibc/busybox.tar.xz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330046/is-from-clause-required-in-dockerfile/58330416#58330416","title":"Is `FROM` clause required in Dockerfile?"}],"owner":{"reputation":998,"user_id":7154924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6cd8cb539f1e58daf05f5e6e4f749e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flow2k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7154924/flow2k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":998,"user_id":7154924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f6cd8cb539f1e58daf05f5e6e4f749e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"flow2k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7154924/flow2k"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58330099,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570738502,"creation_date":1570736451,"last_edit_date":1570737945,"question_id":58330046,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58330046","body_markdown":"For all the Dockerfiles I&#39;ve come across thus (which admittedly is not many), all of them have used a `FROM` clause to base off an existing image, even if it&#39;s `FROM scratch`. \r\n\r\nIs this clause required?

Here is the snippet\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\r\nconst path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\r\nconst axios = require(&quot;axios&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst FileUploadPath = &quot;./uploads/&quot;;\r\n\r\nconst downloadFile = async (url, filePath) =&gt; {\r\n\r\n    const writer = fs.createWriteStream(filePath)\r\n\r\n    const response = await axios({\r\n        url,\r\n        method: &#39;GET&#39;,\r\n        responseType: &#39;stream&#39;\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    response.data.pipe(writer)\r\n\r\n    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n        writer.on(&#39;finish&#39;, async function (err) {\r\n            console.log(err);\r\n            console.log(&quot;file downloaded&quot;)\r\n            resolve(filePath)\r\n          }\r\n        \r\n        )\r\n        writer.on(&#39;error&#39;, reject(null))                \r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst file_resolvers = {\r\n    Query: {\r\n        async file_download(parent, args, context, info) {\r\n            \r\n            const fileUrl = // some file url\r\n            var filePath = // path where downloaded file will be saved \r\n            \r\n            console.log(&quot;Downloading File &quot; + fileUrl);\r\n            const result = await downloadFile(fileUrl, filePath);\r\n            console.log(&quot;Result received: &quot; + result);\r\n\r\n       },\r\n\r\n    },\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n    file_resolvers,\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am getting &quot;file downloaded&quot; message after &quot;Result received: null&quot;. Which means it does not wait for &quot;finish&quot; to get complete and returns with null immediately.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330027/how-to-wait-till-all-nested-functions-are-executed","title":"How to wait till all nested functions are executed"},{"tags":["ubuntu","cron","moodle"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2185,"user_id":2422013,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/VwKps.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AStopher","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2422013/astopher"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570736410,"post_id":58330026,"comment_id":103018001,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330026/moodle-3-3-9-is-not-sending-emails-is-moodle-cron-not-working-or-what#comment103018001_58330026"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12197281,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAuBaBgbGpptDH5cObK0Dne5W-zLEPfDDwYqAPNFg=k-s128","display_name":"Jesus Medeiros","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12197281/jesus-medeiros"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570736334,"creation_date":1570736334,"question_id":58330026,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58330026","body_markdown":"Moodle 3.3.9 is not sending emails.

How can I fix this, or are there other ways to spcecify a condition in a COUNT statement","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330019/using-case-to-set-a-condition-for-count-statement-in-sqlite","title":"Using CASE to set a condition for COUNT statement in SQLite"},{"tags":["oracle"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":195944,"user_id":10397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0a116491222bf3f94c85381528593fd7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Justin Cave","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10397/justin-cave"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570736529,"creation_date":1570736529,"answer_id":58330062,"question_id":58330016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58330062","body_markdown":"You should be able to use `SQL%ROWCOUNT` after running your DML statement\r\n\r\n    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;\r\n    v_line_remove := SQL%ROWCOUNT;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330016/oracle-delete-rows-with-execute-immediate-and-rowcount/58330062#58330062","title":"Oracle : Delete rows with &quot;execute immediate&quot; and rowcount"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":821651,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f099ca01d8b3111107b74203dacc53d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Flatbeat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/821651/flatbeat"},"last_editor":{"reputation":289,"user_id":9323177,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7XF8O.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alan Ge","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9323177/alan-ge"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58330062,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570738210,"creation_date":1570736285,"last_edit_date":1570738210,"question_id":58330016,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58330016","body_markdown":"I want to delete rows with an &quot;Execute immediate&quot; because the table name is in a variable.\r\n\r\nHow can I count the number of lines deleted?\r\n\r\nI tried this, but it does not work with the `INTO v_LINE_REMOVE;`\r\n\r\n    v_sql := &#39;\r\n\t DELETE /*+parallel(t,4)*/\r\n\t FROM &quot;&#39; || v_owner || &#39;&quot;.&quot;&#39; || v_table_name ||&#39;&quot; t\r\n\t where t.&quot;&#39;|| v_column_name ||&#39;&quot; in (\r\n\t\t   select /*+parallel(rem,4)*/\r\n\t\t   rem.&#39; || v_type_data || &#39; \r\n\t\t   from &#39; || v_table_listeremove || &#39; rem \r\n\t\t   WHERE rem.dt_vact = &#39;&#39;&#39;|| v_dt_vact ||&#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n\t )\r\n`&#39;;EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;--INTO v_LINE_REMOVE;`\r\n\r\nThanks a lot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330016/oracle-delete-rows-with-execute-immediate-and-rowcount","title":"Oracle : Delete rows with &quot;execute immediate&quot; and rowcount"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570736515,"post_id":58330014,"comment_id":103018056,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58330014/what-are-the-different-types-of-modularity-standard-library-imported-librari#comment103018056_58330014"},{"owner":{"reputation":339,"user_id":10332878,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cd2a5e762a2227040a294914069b832f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"C.

There&#39;s a google sheet with lots of google document links. I retrieve these links open the file, go through its content and append it to a new document. This needs to be done for all documents in this list. After struggling for a while I got all of it working except for positioned images. Either I don&#39;t get an image at all, or the image gets copied in, but from that point on is copied and pasted on every page of the document. I&#39;m probably just failing somewhere in the coding process but can&#39;t seem to find my own flaw. Note that I work in IT but not as a developer so Yes the code is written very poorly :&#39;(\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried and reeditted my code repeatedly to ensure i was picking up the positioned image properly (e.g. by putting text in instead of the image etc. and it all seems to work properly, however the positioned image keeps repeating all over the document.)\r\n\r\nNote that below I&#39;ve only included the bad function and the main i&#39;m calling, not all the get stuff from the excel sheet as that&#39;s working properly.\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\nI&#39;ve updated my code. It now successfully finds, sets layout etc. and places the positioned images.\r\n\r\nHowever, from that point on, the positioned images that have been placed earlier in the merged document are repeated on the last paragraph of every appended document.\r\n\r\n``` Google API script\r\nfunction main() {\r\n  var spreadsheetid = &quot;Fill_this_with_spreadsheet_ID&quot;; \r\n\r\n  var DocIDS = []; \r\n  DocIDS = getDocIDFromSpreadsheet(spreadsheetid);\r\n  mergeGoogleDocs(DocIDS);\r\n  //remove_blank(DocIDS);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/*Function to append contents of document to another document\r\n  for (var i = 1; i &lt; List.length; ++i ) {\r\n    var otherBody = DocumentApp.openById(List[i]).getActiveSection();\r\n    var totalElements = otherBody.getNumChildren();\r\n    baseDoc.saveAndClose()\r\n    var baseDoc = DocumentApp.openById(DocIDS[0]);\r\n    var body = baseDoc.getActiveSection();\r\n    for( var j = 0; j &lt; totalElements; ++j ) {\r\n      var element = otherBody.getChild(j).copy();\r\n      var type = element.getType();\r\n      if( type == DocumentApp.ElementType.PARAGRAPH ){\r\n          var positionedImages = element.getPositionedImages();\r\n          if ( positionedImages == &quot;PositionedImage&quot;) {\r\n          //This is required because the positionedImage needs a &quot;new&quot; pragraph to anchor to...\r\n          var paragraph = body.appendParagraph(&quot;&quot;);\r\n          var tempvalue = positionedImages[0].getLayout();\r\n          var tempheight = positionedImages[0].getHeight();\r\n          var tempwidth = positionedImages[0].getWidth();\r\n          var tempblob = positionedImages[0].getBlob();\r\n          paragraph.addPositionedImage(tempblob);\r\n          var positionedImages2 = paragraph.getPositionedImages();\r\n          positionedImages2[0].setLayout(tempvalue);\r\n          positionedImages2[0].setLayout(tempvalue);\r\n          positionedImages2[0].setHeight(tempheight);\r\n          positionedImages2[0].setWidth(tempwidth);          \r\n          //To-do, fix repeated multiplication of positioned Images on all following documents at the final paragraph.\r\n          }\r\n        else {\r\n        body.appendParagraph(element);\r\n        }\r\n        }\r\n      else if( type == DocumentApp.ElementType.TABLE ){\r\n        body.appendTable(element);}\r\n      else if( type == DocumentApp.ElementType.LIST_ITEM ) {\r\n        glyphType = element.getGlyphType();\r\n        body.appendListItem(element);\r\n        element.setGlyphType(glyphType);\r\n        }\r\n      else\r\n        throw new Error(&quot;Unknown element type: &quot;+type);\r\n    }\r\n    body.appendPageBreak()\r\n    \r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expect to get all documents merged into one document. while it does merge everything, it goes wrong on positioned images.

If you only want adjacent rows with the same value to be included in each group, then ask a *new* question with appropriate sample data and desired results.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=sqlserver_2017&amp;fiddle=997ce2fb2fc85303b7dc0ed8d489d873","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329984/sql-server-switch-based-on-grouping-of-previous-values/58330563#58330563","title":"SQL Server Switch Based on grouping of previous values"}],"owner":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2827048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6031361b8ee98f21f4049dec456a8628?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2827048","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2827048/user2827048"},"last_editor":{"reputation":189,"user_id":2827048,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6031361b8ee98f21f4049dec456a8628?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2827048","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2827048/user2827048"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58330563,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570836986,"creation_date":1570736104,"last_edit_date":1570798328,"question_id":58329984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329984","body_markdown":"I have a table of order information in the following format:\r\n\r\n    ╔══════════════╦══════╦════════════════╦═══════════╦═════════╦══════════╗\r\n    ║ Order Number ║ Line ║      Item      ║ Warehouse ║ Carrier ║ Quantity ║\r\n    ╠══════════════╬══════╬════════════════╬═══════════╬═════════╬══════════╣\r\n    ║          255 ║    1 ║ STUFFED-ANIMAL ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        3 ║\r\n    ║          256 ║    1 ║ BLOCKS         ║ WH2       ║ FEDEX   ║        1 ║\r\n    ║          257 ║    1 ║ DOLL           ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        1 ║\r\n    ║          257 ║    2 ║ DRESS          ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        3 ║\r\n    ║          257 ║    3 ║ SHOES          ║ WH2       ║ UPS     ║        1 ║\r\n    ║          258 ║    1 ║ CHAIR          ║ WH3       ║ FEDEX   ║        1 ║\r\n    ║          258 ║    2 ║ CHAIR          ║ WH3       ║ UPS     ║        2 ║\r\n    ╚══════════════╩══════╩════════════════╩═══════════╩═════════╩══════════╝\r\n\r\nI am trying to query it in such a way that I partition it into groups based on a unique combination of columns.\r\n\r\nIn my example, I would like the following result:\r\n\r\n    ╔════════════════╦══════╦════════════════╦═══════════╦═════════╦══════════╗\r\n    ║ Package-Number ║ Line ║      Item      ║ Warehouse ║ Carrier ║ Quantity ║\r\n    ╠════════════════╬══════╬════════════════╬═══════════╬═════════╬══════════╣\r\n    ║ 255            ║    1 ║ STUFFED-ANIMAL ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        3 ║\r\n    ║ 256            ║    1 ║ BLOCKS         ║ WH2       ║ FEDEX   ║        1 ║\r\n    ║ 257-1          ║    1 ║ DOLL           ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        1 ║\r\n    ║ 257-1          ║    2 ║ DRESS          ║ WH1       ║ UPS     ║        3 ║\r\n    ║ 257-2          ║    3 ║ SHOES          ║ WH2       ║ UPS     ║        1 ║\r\n    ║ 258-1          ║    1 ║ CHAIR          ║ WH3       ║ FEDEX   ║        1 ║\r\n    ║ 258-2          ║    2 ║ CHAIR          ║ WH3       ║ UPS     ║        2 ║\r\n    ╚════════════════╩══════╩════════════════╩═══════════╩═════════╩══════════╝\r\n\r\nTo break it down I would like to do the following:\r\n\r\nIf the order number, warehouse, and carrier are the same that is one &#39;partition.&#39; If there is only one partition then we just leave the order number as the package number, otherwise we break it down into packages.

[ Note: That is, for lvalues, a reference cast\r\n&gt; reinterpret_cast(x) has the same effect as the conversion\r\n&gt; *reinterpret_cast(&amp;x) with the built-in &amp; and * operators (and similarly for reinterpret_cast(x)). —end note ]\r\n\r\nFor pointers, reinterpret_cast boils down to conversion to void* and then to the target type:\r\n\r\n&gt; An object pointer can be explicitly converted to an object pointer of a different type.72 When a prvalue v of object pointer type is\r\n&gt; converted to the object pointer type “pointer to cv T”, the result is\r\n&gt; static_cast&lt;cv T*&gt;(static_cast&lt;cv void*&gt;(v)).\r\n\r\nThe semantics of the two static casts are defined as:\r\n\r\n&gt; A prvalue of type “pointer to cv1 void” can be converted to a prvalue of type “pointer to cv2 T,” where T is an object type and cv2\r\n&gt; is the same cv-qualification as, or greater cv-qualification than,\r\n&gt; cv1. The null pointer value is converted to the null pointer value of\r\n&gt; the destination type. If the original pointer value represents the\r\n&gt; address A of a byte in memory and A satisfies the alignment\r\n&gt; requirement of T, then the resulting pointer value represents the same\r\n&gt; address as the original pointer value, that is, A. The result of any\r\n&gt; other such pointer conversion is unspecified.\r\n\r\nSince `int32_t` and `float` have same size and alignment, I should get a new pointer pointing to the same address. What I am wondering is if \r\n\r\n&gt;  a reference cast reinterpret_cast(x) has the same effect as the\r\n&gt; conversion *reinterpret_cast(&amp;x) with the built-in &amp; and *

I took a few steps.\r\n\r\nFirst, I decided to organize things a bit by adding a column to reflect the sum of charges, payments, adjustments and bad_debt. This comes in handy later for the running total. It felt a little &quot;hacky&quot; but, I&#39;m just learning, so whatever.\r\n\r\n    sum(CHARGE_AMOUNT)+sum(VOID_AMOUNT)+sum(PAYMENT_AMOUNT)+\r\n    \tsum(ADJUSTMENT_AMOUNT)+sum(ACTIVE_AR_IN_OUT) as sum_of_values \r\n\r\nSecond, I created a running total. This was a challenge initially because I couldn&#39;t reference the month and year unless I gave it an alias as month_year and placed in a subquery in the FROM clause. \r\n\r\n    FROM \r\n    \t(SELECT \r\n    CASE\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-06-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-06-30&#39; THEN &#39;June - 2019&#39;\r\n    \t\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-07-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-07-31&#39; THEN &#39;July - 2019&#39;\r\n    \t\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-08-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-08-31&#39; THEN &#39;August - 2019&#39;\r\n    \t\tELSE &#39;Other&#39; END as month_year,\r\n    \t\t(SELECT sum(OUTSTANDING_AMT)\r\n    \tFROM ARPB_TRANSACTIONS\r\n    \tWHERE POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-05-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-05-31&#39;) as beginning_balance,\r\n    \tsum(CHARGE_AMOUNT)+sum(VOID_AMOUNT) as charge_tot, \r\n    \tsum(PAYMENT_AMOUNT) as payment_tot,\r\n    \tsum(ADJUSTMENT_AMOUNT) as adjustment_tot,\r\n    \tsum(ACTIVE_AR_IN_OUT) as bad_debt_tot,\r\n    \tsum(CHARGE_AMOUNT)+sum(VOID_AMOUNT)+sum(PAYMENT_AMOUNT)+\r\n    \tsum(ADJUSTMENT_AMOUNT)+sum(ACTIVE_AR_IN_OUT) as sum_of_values \r\n    FROM F_ARPB_CUBE_ETR_DETAIL \r\n    WHERE POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-06-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-08-31&#39;\r\n    GROUP BY CASE\t\r\n    \tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-06-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-06-30&#39; THEN &#39;June - 2019&#39;\r\n    \tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-07-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-07-31&#39; THEN &#39;July - 2019&#39;\r\n    \tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-08-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-08-31&#39; THEN &#39;August - 2019&#39;\r\n    \tELSE &#39;Other&#39; END ) as x\r\n\r\nThird, this then allowed me to specifically reference &quot;month_year&quot; in my running total expression:\r\n\r\n     SELECT\tmonth_year, beginning_balance,charge_tot, payment_tot, adjustment_tot, bad_debt_tot, sum_of_values, SUM(sum_of_values) OVER (ORDER BY month_year desc) as running_total\r\n\r\nLast, instead of a running (sum) total, I actually needed a running subtraction from the prior months running total (that being the &quot;beginning_balance&quot; less the &quot;sum_of_values&quot;) so to do that I just modified the above expression like:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\tmonth_year, beginning_balance,charge_tot, payment_tot, adjustment_tot, bad_debt_tot, sum_of_values, beginning_balance-SUM(sum_of_values) OVER (ORDER BY month_year desc) as running_total\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s the final query:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\tmonth_year, beginning_balance,charge_tot, payment_tot, adjustment_tot, bad_debt_tot, sum_of_values, beginning_balance-SUM(sum_of_values) OVER (ORDER BY month_year desc) as running_total\r\n    FROM \r\n    \t(SELECT \r\n    CASE\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-06-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-06-30&#39; THEN &#39;June - 2019&#39;\r\n    \t\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-07-01&#39; AND &#39;2019-07-31&#39; THEN &#39;July - 2019&#39;\r\n    \t\tWHEN POST_DATE BETWEEN &#39;2019-08-01&#39;

Change in the model reflects the input value and vice versa. Once the data is changed in the select the `change()` event triggers and call the method `select()` or whatever you name it. You don&#39;t need to pass values as the `this.newmp.number` holds the new value and you do your logic and assign the value for your input through `this.newmp.coefficient`. Again, since it&#39;s two-way data binding, the value changes to `this.newmp.coefficient` in logic automatically reflects the value of the input in the HTML template.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58329910/angular-6-reactive-forms-how-to-populate-one-text-field-based-on-the-selection/58329979#58329979","title":"Angular 6 Reactive Forms- How to populate one text field based on the selection of another input"}],"owner":{"reputation":266,"user_id":9899126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-w3N3oKCO2bw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAGaw/bT7zqY0zqy4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"LaurenAH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9899126/laurenah"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4563,"user_id":894532,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/epFXH.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Maihan Nijat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/894532/maihan-nijat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58329979,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570736484,"creation_date":1570735778,"last_edit_date":1570736103,"question_id":58329910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58329910","body_markdown":"I am new to Angular 6 and reactive forms, and I am trying to get the selection of one field to auto-populate the field of another.\r\n\r\nThe goal: If you select the number &#39;1&#39; from the &#39;select&#39; menu, the coefficient input will auto-populate to &quot;.15&quot;.
