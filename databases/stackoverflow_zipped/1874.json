need to define your own key for the comparison. You want empty strings last. We can use the fact, that an empty string is *falsey*.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(&#39;a&#39;)\r\n    True\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bool(&#39;&#39;)\r\n    False\r\n\r\n`True` is bigger than `False` so non-empty strings would be sorted after empty strings but we need it the other way round.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; not &#39;a&#39;\r\n    False\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; not &#39;&#39;\r\n    True\r\n\r\nAs a second sort criterion we&#39;ll take the string itself. To do that we have to compare the tuple `(not s, s)` where `s` is the string. \r\n\r\nWe can feed this to `sorted` with the `key` parameter and a `lambda` function.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; data = [&#39;stro&#39;, &#39;asdv&#39;, &#39;&#39;, &#39;figh&#39;]\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(sorted(data, key=lambda s: (not s, s)))\r\n    [&#39;asdv&#39;, &#39;figh&#39;, &#39;stro&#39;, &#39;&#39;]\r\n\r\nIf you want it reversed add the `reverse` parameter.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(sorted(data, key=lambda s: (not s, s), reverse=True))\r\n    [&#39;&#39;, &#39;stro&#39;, &#39;figh&#39;, &#39;asdv&#39;]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease note that I renamed your variable `list` to `data`.

some jQuery code sending data through an AJAX call to a PHP script.\r\n\r\nData consists of an object with two properties.\r\n\r\nOne of the properties is a string, obtained by `JSON.strinfigy(arrayofobjects)` an array of objects.\r\nEach object in `arrayofobjects` contains 3 properties, each being a simple string.\r\nThe number of objects in `arrayofobjects` is variable based on some user actions.\r\n\r\nThe problem is: when `arrayofobjects` exceeds the number of 25 objects the AJAX call fails and returns `403 Forbidden`, so any debug is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt seems like the string resulting from `JSON.stringify` and sent through AJAX ovverides a maximum length.\r\n\r\nThe web server is Apache2 running on Ubuntu 18.04.\r\nNot using any PHP framework.\r\n\r\nWhat I have tried:\r\n\r\n - Apache mod_security module is not active\r\n - In php.ini: display_errors = On, log_errors = On and error_reporting = E_ALL\r\n - Set write permissions for every user on apache2/error.log\r\n - Regular working apache2/error.log, but no trace of AJAX-related issue, no trace of any `403` error\r\n - URL of called script is correct\r\n - It&#39;s not a cross-domain call\r\n - File permissions are OK since the script is called successfully in other instances and when `arrayofobjects` contains less than 25 elements\r\n - I can access the called page directly through http\r\n - Increased `max_input_vars` value in `php.ini`\r\n\r\nThe structure of AJAX call:\r\n   ```javascript\r\n$.ajax({\r\n   url: &quot;ajax/called_page.php&quot;,\r\n   type: &#39;post&#39;,\r\n   data: {action: &quot;post_duty&quot;, content: JSON.stringify(arrayofobjects)},\r\n   dataType: &quot;json&quot;,\r\n   success: function(data) {\r\n    do some DOM manipulation\r\n   }, error: function() {\r\n    alert(&#39;Contact webmaster&#39;);\r\n

With the object tag, I tried adding the alt text within the tags &lt;object&gt; &lt;img /&gt; ALT Text &lt;/object&gt;.\r\nI&#39;ve also tried using the pseudo selector ::after to the object tag\r\n\r\nNothing worked :(\r\n\r\n1.\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;img src=&quot;src.png&quot; alt&quot;Logo text here&quot; onerror=&quot;this.style.display=&#39;none&#39;&quot;/&gt;\r\n```\r\n2.\r\n```javascript\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n  document.addEventListener(&quot;DOMContentLoaded&quot;, function(event) {\r\n   document.querySelectorAll(&#39;img&#39;).forEach(function(img){\r\n  \timg.onerror = function(){this.style.display=&#39;none&#39;;};\r\n   })\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n3.\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;object data=&quot;src.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;img src=&quot;src.png&quot; alt&quot;Logo text here&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/object&gt;\r\n```\r\n3.\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;object data=&quot;src.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;img src=&quot;src.png&quot; alt&quot;Logo text here&quot; /&gt;\r\n  Logo text here\r\n&lt;/object&gt;\r\n```\r\n3.\r\n```javascript\r\n&lt;object data=&quot;src.png&quot; type=&quot;image/png&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;img src=&quot;src.png&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;/object&gt;\r\n\r\nobject::after {\r\n content: &quot;Logo text here&quot;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing worked :/ \r\n\r\nI&#39;d appreciate some help and I hope what I am asking for makes sense and is doable.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095952/making-the-image-alt-text-look-almost-identical-on-all-browsers","title":"Making the image alt text look almost identical on all browsers"},{"tags":["asp.net-core","visual-studio-2019","asp.net-core-3.0"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569406583,"post_id":58095951,"comment_id":102584350,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095951/net-core-3-rc1-to-final-upgrade-missing-from-visual-studio-2019#comment102584350_58095951"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569406866,"post_id":58095951,"comment_id":102584506,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095951/net-core-3-rc1-to-final-upgrade-missing-from-visual-studio-2019#comment102584506_58095951"},{"owner":{"reputation":123,"user_id":5280471,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/837155e8bc791ef5cd9d065dbd9fd0f4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Avenger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5280471/avenger"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569408684,"post_id":58095951,"comment_id":102585473,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095951/net-core-3-rc1-to-final-upgrade-missing-from-visual-studio-2019#comment102585473_58095951"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569409148,"creation_date":1569409148,"answer_id":58096877,"question_id":58095951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58096877","body_markdown":"The Visual Studio version that works with the [release version of .NET Core 3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-core-3-0/) is [Visual Studio 2019 16.3](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/dot-net-core-support-in-visual-studio-2019-version-16-3/).\r\n\r\nAs for the error itself, it&#39;s probably caused by the MSBuild environment variables registered by the older Visual Studio.

To access any of them you use z[0] for the first int, z[1] for the second int, etc. till z[99].\r\n\r\nSimilarly you may want to have an array of chars like such:\r\n\r\n    char u[50];\r\n\r\nto access the first character you use u[0], etc.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to multidimensional arrays, you may have:\r\n\r\n    char u[10][50];\r\n\r\nwhich means you have 10 rows of 50 elements each. You can also call them strings, so 10 strings.\r\n\r\nTo access the first string you use u[0]. The last string is at u[9].\r\n\r\nNow for each string you can access their elements like such: u[0][1] to access the second element of the first string.\r\n\r\nstrcpy requires as its first argument a string. So if you have u[10][50], you can pass u[9], which would be last string. You should not pass u[9][2] which would be the third char from the last string.\r\n\r\nWhat you did is u[1][50], which means you so happen to have only 1 row in your list of strings. You still need to follow the same rules as for multidimensional arrays even though it is 1 string only. Normally you&#39;d use u[50] and just pass u to strcpy\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095948/why-does-a-char-array-require-two-of-but-an-int-array-requires-one/58096358#58096358","title":"Why does a &quot;char array&quot; require two of &quot;[]&quot; but an &quot;int array&quot; requires one &quot;[]&quot;?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":24641,"user_id":4386427,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2d2716ce8bcf5967e7b3c00bd0095b5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"4386427","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4386427/4386427"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569407571,"creation_date":1569407571,"answer_id":58096416,"question_id":58095948,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58096416","body_markdown":"&gt;Well then in such case..\r\n\r\n&gt;for the char array why are two of [] required ?\r\n\r\nIt is not required...\r\n\r\nYour confusion seems to come from the way string (aka text strings) are handled in C.\r\n\r\nIn C a string is a **char array** with the special requirement that a char in the array has the value NUL (aka `&#39;\\0&#39;`).

There is a special kind of `char` array in `C` commonly referred to as a `C String`, which is just a regular `char` array with the last character being the null terminator: `\\0`.  An array of `C strings` does commonly use two sets of brackets: `[][]`.\r\nThe rules for representing a `char` array are the same as those for representing an `int` array.  both can be described as a collection of values stored in a contiguous set of memory locations.  To illustrate, example arrays of `int`, `char` and a `C string` follow:\r\n\r\n    int  numarr[]   = {99,104,97,114,32,97,114,114,97,121,0};\r\n    char chararr1[] = {&#39;c&#39;,&#39;h&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39; &#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;r&#39;,&#39;a&#39;,&#39;y&#39;,&#39;\\0&#39;};\r\n    char chararr2[] = {99,104,97,114,32,97,114,114,97,121,0};\r\n    char string[]   = {&quot;char array&quot;}; \r\n\r\nThe array values in each of the 4 examples above are identical.  In most implementations, the `int` array is stored in a contiguous set 4 byte memory locations, while each of the `char` arrays are stored in a contiguous set of 1 byte memory locations. The three `char` arrays, if used in `printf()` would result in the same _string_ output, as each is an array of `char` terminated with a null value.\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;%s\\n%s\\n%s\\n&quot;, chararr1, chararr2, string);\r\n\r\n&gt; char array     \r\n&gt; char array   \r\n&gt; char array  \r\n\r\n\r\nMore about the special `char` array - _C string_, and arrays of _C string_\r\n\r\n    char string[] = {&quot;this is a string&quot;}; \r\n\r\nA _C string_ is defined an a null terminated array of `char`:  The content de-marked between `^` is `string` defined above.  Note the null termination. \r\n\r\n    |t|h|i|s| |i|s| |a| |s|t|r|i|n|g|\\0|?|?|\r\n    ^                                  ^\r\n\r\nA contiguous set of C strings, or _array of C strings_ however can be represented by using two set of square brackets:\r\n\r\n    char strings[2][20] = {&quot;first string&quot;, &quot;second string&quot;};\r\n\r\nThis array of string would look like this in memory:  \r\n\r\n    |f|i|r|s|t| |s|t|r|i|n|g|\\0|s|e|c|o|n|d| |s|t|r|i|n|g|\\0|?|?|?|\r\n    |       |           |      |\r\n    [0]     |           |      [1]   1st index used to access full string\r\n            [0][4]=&#39;t&#39;  [0][10]=&#39;n&#39;  2nd index used to access array elements  \r\n\r\nWhile each string can be accessed by using the first index, \r\n\r\n    eg. strings[0] = &quot;first string&quot; and strings[1] = &quot;second string&quot;\r\n\r\neach character of each string can be accessed using the first and second index\r\n\r\n    eg. strings[0][0] == &#39;f&#39;  and strings[1][0] == &#39;s&#39;\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095948/why-does-a-char-array-require-two-of-but-an-int-array-requires-one/58097896#58097896","title":"Why does a &quot;char array&quot; require two of &quot;[]&quot; but an &quot;int array&quot; requires one &quot;[]&quot;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":71,"user_id":12100635,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b44a749f3fe873f87d45c449ee2099d0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"S&#252;mer Kol&#231;ak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12100635/s%c3%bcmer-kol%c3%a7ak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3970,"user_id":10871073,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MVHuc.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10871073/adrian"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":128,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":4,"accepted_answer_id":58096358,"answer_count":5,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569417310,"creation_date":1569406025,"last_edit_date":1569416396,"question_id":58095948,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58095948","body_markdown":"In a `char` array, you are required to have 2 of `[]`.

It works fine for me, even did not noticed any issue with it.\r\nToday i was trying to make bulk request to API and I received an exception \r\n\r\n&gt; Concurrent reads or writes are not supported\r\nat `await HttpContext.Request.Body.ReadAsync(buffer,0,buffer.Length)` where buffer is `var buffer= new byte[Convert.ToInt32(HttpContext.Request.ContentLength)]`\r\n\r\nI have some confusion at this level\r\n\r\n 1. Does .Net core creates separate pipeline for each request. I think yes, as HttpContext.Items are unique to each request cycle.\r\n 2. If yes, then why I am receiving concurrent error.

(see example 2)\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n\r\n``` c#\r\npublic static class DateTimeGetter\r\n{\r\n    public async static Task&lt;DateTime&gt; FromService(\r\n        this DateTime value, IDataTimeService timeProvider)\r\n    {\r\n        return await timeProvider.Get();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n \r\n``` c#\r\npublic class DateTimeGetter : IDateTimeGetter\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IDataTimeService timeProvider;\r\n\r\n    public DateTimeGetter(IDataTimeService timeProvider)\r\n    {\r\n        this.timeProvider = timeProvider ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(&quot;timeProvider&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;DateTime&gt; FromService(\r\n        DateTime value, IDataTimeService timeProvider)\r\n    {\r\n        return await this.timeProvider.Get();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen using *Constructor Injection*, the `DateTimeGetter` itself will have to be injected into its consumers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ploeh/2006/08/24/volatile-dependencies/\r\n  [2]: https://freecontent.manning.com/the-ambient-context-anti-pattern/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095930/property-injection-into-extension-class-with-autofac/58096186#58096186","title":"property injection into extension class with autofac"}],"owner":{"reputation":2612,"user_id":3446201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LqSia.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ehsan Akbar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3446201/ehsan-akbar"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58096186,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569412511,"creation_date":1569405964,"question_id":58095930,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58095930","body_markdown":"I want to inject my class(IDateTimeService ) into extension class using property injection as you can see  :\r\n\r\n    public  static  class DateTimeGetter\r\n    {\r\n    \r\n        public static  IDateTimeService Localdate { set; get; }\r\n       \r\n        public async  static Task&lt;DateTime&gt; FromService(this DateTime value)\r\n        {\r\n            //ocaldate = localdate;\r\n            return await Localdate.Get();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI have used **restease**  to connect to another microservice using interface as you can see :\r\n\r\n\r\n    public interface IDateTimeService\r\n        {\r\n            [AllowAnyStatusCode]\r\n            [Get(&quot;api/LocalTime&quot;)]\r\n            Task&lt;DateTime&gt; Get();\r\n        }\r\n\r\nFinally i added the injection code into my startup file :\r\n\r\n          builder.RegisterType&lt;IDateTimeService&gt;();\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem is when i run my service the Localdate  property is null :\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hbuDQ.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095930/property-injection-into-extension-class-with-autofac","title":"property injection into extension class with autofac"},{"tags":["typescript","sequelize.js","feathers-sequelize"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":640,"user_id":2864928,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ab15a02935d62270fca8b0d70bc653f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KenOn10","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2864928/kenon10"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569423897,"post_id":58095929,"comment_id":102594456,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095929/returning-self-referencing-one-to-many-in-sequelize#comment102594456_58095929"}],"owner":{"reputation":3760,"user_id":4620733,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ajCsJtIDhCE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/VDLJ1dSAyvk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"George Edwards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4620733/george-edwards"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3760,"user_id":4620733,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ajCsJtIDhCE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABU/VDLJ1dSAyvk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"George Edwards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4620733/george-edwards"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569406796,"creation_date":1569405955,"last_edit_date":1569406796,"question_id":58095929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58095929","body_markdown":"If I have a self-referencing one-to-many data model, for example `folder`, in a sequelize driven SQL database (SQLite).

In the loop it used Thread.Sleep to wait a few 100 ms which is a lot in a service (we want to redesign this. Not a good idea to sleep in a service right?).\r\n\r\nI would like to improve the throughput by making the method async and using Task.Delay instead, without changing the service contract.

Please note below things:\r\n\r\n 1. **First**: You absolutely should not have duplicate IDs. It may work, but it is semantically incorrect and you should not do it. You are adding same row onclick, so you should give it same class\r\n\r\n 2. **Second**: Same goes for name attribute. If you want to capture multiple data of same type you should use `supplyingLocRecord[]`. It will capture all elements into single array.\r\n\r\n  `&lt;input type=&#39;button&#39; name=&#39;supplyingLocRecord[]&#39; value=&#39;Delete&#39; class=&#39;deletesupLoc&#39;&gt;`\r\n\r\n 3. **Third**: The `click()` binding you&#39;re using is called a &quot;direct&quot; binding which will only attach the handler to elements that already exist. It won&#39;t get bound to elements created in the future. To do that, you&#39;ll have to create a &quot;delegated&quot; binding by using `on()`.\r\n\r\n\r\n    `$(document).on(&#39;click&#39;,&#39;.deletesupLoc&#39;,function(){\r\n          $(this).parents(&quot;tr&quot;).remove();\r\n        });`\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095916/how-to-add-and-delete-input-value-using-jquery/58096991#58096991","title":"How To add and delete input value using jquery?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":43,"user_id":10695455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wELjGQUZjzM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-hLgcGC5NRlmRT0qemHde4IsG9cxA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Meggi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10695455/meggi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569411912,"post_id":58097107,"comment_id":102587159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095916/how-to-add-and-delete-input-value-using-jquery/58097107#comment102587159_58097107"},{"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":10539302,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5459fae02ace614258456fcaa84b67d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dana Ciocan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539302/dana-ciocan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":43,"user_id":10695455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-wELjGQUZjzM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-hLgcGC5NRlmRT0qemHde4IsG9cxA/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Meggi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10695455/meggi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569412377,"post_id":58097107,"comment_id":102587386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095916/how-to-add-and-delete-input-value-using-jquery/58097107#comment102587386_58097107"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":101,"user_id":10539302,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5459fae02ace614258456fcaa84b67d2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dana Ciocan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10539302/dana-ciocan"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569410106,"creation_date":1569410106,"answer_id":58097107,"question_id":58095916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58097107","body_markdown":"It&#39;s because the button with ID `deletesupLoc` doesn&#39;t exist in the DOM when you call `.click()` on it.

trying to add an object to my three.js scene for each item in an array. I can&#39;t tell if all of the object are adding to the scene because they are adding to the same position, and I can&#39;t figure out how to change the position of each object. \r\n\r\nHere is the code looping and adding a cube for each item in array: \r\n```\r\nvar geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );\r\nvar material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial( { color: 0x00ff00 } );\r\nvar cube = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );\r\n\r\ngetData()\r\nasync function getData() {\r\n\tconst response = await fetch(&#39;/api/indexvr&#39;);\r\n\tconst data = await response.json();\r\n\tconsole.log(data)\r\n\r\n\tfor (var i=0; i&lt;data.length; i++) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\tscene.add( cube );\r\n\t\t// cube.position.y = i //1++\r\n\t\t} catch (e) {\r\n\t\t\tconsole.error(e)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\t\r\n\r\ncamera.position.z = 5;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried declaring the cubes and their position in the for loop but that didn&#39;t work either. I need for all of the objects to be visible and for their positions to be dynamic depending on the amount in the array, e.g. something like a circle around the camera and if there are more than 10/15, increase the y axis by 4 and continue the circle again.. I can&#39;t figure out how or find documentation to help. Any ideas or links to help?

It shows the image where you click and then makes it disappear 0.2 seconds latter.

This might have changed in a latter version than I have so it might be possible to omit it. But the code didn&#39;t work without it on my machine.\r\n\r\nCalling show on the EventBox and Fixed was redundant as the `window.show_all()` will show them as they are part of the tree at that time. But the show call on the Image is not unless you are using the version of GTK where widgets are shown by default instead of hidden.

posted, the question is a bit of an X-Y problem, since you don&#39;t need to know the width to achieve the output you want. For this, it should be enough to know the total [width](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/ios_base/width) of the field, and use a suitable [fill](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/fill) character.\r\n\r\nThis should work for you:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstd::ostream&amp; operator&lt;&lt;(std::ostream&amp; log, const Entry&amp; e)\r\n{\r\n    auto beg = log.tellp();\r\n    log &lt;&lt; e.name_;\r\n    auto len = log.tellp() - beg;\r\n    auto oldFill = log.fill();\r\n    auto oldWidth = log.width();\r\n    log.fill(&#39;.&#39;);\r\n    log.width(line_width - len);\r\n    log &lt;&lt; e.value_;\r\n    log.fill(oldFill);\r\n    log.width(oldWidth);\r\n    return log;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[[Live example]](http://coliru.stacked-crooked.com/a/6df5e05495cc6c46)\r\n\r\nNote that this relies on the stream actually being capable of reporting valid values by `tellp()`.

you don&#39;t own `example.com`.\r\n\r\nSo you can&#39;t expect visiting http://nodeservice1.istio-system.example.com from your browser to work, because you didn&#39;t configure the DNS for domain.\r\n\r\nWhen you do `curl -H &quot;Host: foo&quot; http://ip`, it doesn&#39;t need to go through DNS (because you give `ip` address directly). The `Host` header you provided (normally provided by the browser, inferred from the URL) is then used by Istio ingress gateway to route the traffic to the correct service.\r\n\r\nAssuming you use Knative/Cloud Run, you should consider [updating the default domain on Cloud Run on GKE][1] from example.com to something you own, so that you can set DNS records for your

However when reaching a breakpoint Xcode becomes more or less unusable:\r\n\r\n - Program execution stops immediately when the breakpoint is reached. However Xcode needs up to 30 seconds to show the position in the code window and another minute or so to load the content of the variable view (which shows the values and states of the variables available at the breakpoint).\r\n - If I use the *Step into* or *Step over* features it takes up to a minute to perform the next step and again another minute to load the variables.\r\n\r\nI am running Xcode on a Mac mini 2018 with a 3.2 GHz i7 and 32 GB ram. I have used Xcode 10 on the same machine before without any problems.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSearching for &quot;Xcode slow&quot; brings up a ton of threads and possible solutions of course. From my years as iOS Developer I know that Xcode never was the fastest and stable program. However it was never as bad as now.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately none of the know tricks (restarting Xcode or the Mac, cleaning the project, cleaning the Xcode library folders, etc. had any effect,\r\n\r\n**So the big question is:**\r\n\r\n**Is this a known problem in Xcode 11?

*&quot;The problem is that req.body on the server side, pushes the answers on both forms in an array. &quot;*\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s not actually correct, as it is in fact the **client** request which is actually being sent like that. Basically that&#39;s the default for `x-www-form-urlencoded` data when you submit *more than one value* for a provided field name, and it sends what is interpreted as *arrays* for each field, instead of an *array of submissions* in the way you are expecting.\r\n\r\nSeems more to me like you could be submitting the data in a more suitable format ( i.e a pre-structed JSON representation of the object you actually want ), but in lieu of actually changing the code which submits the form you could always just transform what is sent into a reasonable representation of what you want to actually insert for a new `Person`.\r\n\r\nPresuming of course that the only data present in `req.body` is related to the `experience` part of the data to be added then a simple statement transforms this in the *array* of entries you actually want, rather than just *all fields as arrays* as they currently are:\r\n\r\n    let data = req.body;\r\n\r\n    // For each total array length of a required field\r\n    let experience = [ ...Array(data.company.length)]\r\n      Get all the keys of the input object  \r\n      .map((e,i) =&gt; Object.keys(data)\r\n        // Turn that into an object of singular values for the current index\r\n        .reduce((o,e) =&gt; ({ ...o, [e]: data[e][i] }),{})\r\n      )\r\n\r\nIF however you have more data in `req.body` and only want a set of specific fields, then that&#39;s just a simple modification with a `Array.filter()`. Runs in the browser from within this post this time:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n       // Just simulating the content submitted in req.body\r\n       let req = {\r\n         body: {\r\n            &quot;company&quot; : [\r\n                    &quot;companyA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;companyB&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;positionExperience&quot; : [\r\n                    &quot;positionA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;positionB&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;descriptionExperience&quot; : [\r\n                    &quot;descriptionA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;descriptionB&quot;\r\n            ]\r\n          }\r\n        };\r\n     \r\n\r\n        // list of allowed fields\r\n        let whitelist = [\r\n          &#39;company&#39;,\r\n          &#39;positionExperience&#39;,\r\n          &#39;descriptionExperience&#39;,\r\n          &#39;websiteExperience&#39;,\r\n          &#39;timeperiodExperience&#39;\r\n        ]\r\n\r\n        // Remove all but the wanted fields\r\n        let data = Object.entries(req.body)\r\n          .filter(([k,v]) =&gt; whitelist.indexOf(k) != -1)\r\n          .reduce((o,[k,v]) =&gt; ({ ...o, [k]: v }),{});\r\n\r\n        let experience = [ ...Array(data.company.length)]\r\n          .map((e,i) =&gt; Object.keys(data).reduce((o,e) =&gt; ({ ...o, [e]: data[e][i] }),{}))\r\n\r\n        console.log(experience)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nEither where those were the only keys of the input `req.body` or where you extracted only what you wanted via the alteration directly above, the output `experience` array is then ( as based on the sample data shown in the question to be added not how intended ):\r\n\r\n    [\r\n            {\r\n                    &quot;company&quot; : &quot;companyA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;positionExperience&quot; : &quot;positionA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;descriptionExperience&quot; : &quot;descriptionA&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                    &quot;company&quot; : &quot;companyB&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;positionExperience&quot; : &quot;positionB&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;descriptionExperience&quot; : &quot;descriptionB&quot;\r\n            }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich basically means that `experience` can simply be transposed into your existing code as follows:\r\n\r\n    const person = new Person({ file: req.file.path, experience });\r\n\r\nThen of course what will be saved will reflect that same structure:\r\n\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;file&quot;: &quot;whateverFileNameSupplied&quot;,\r\n      &quot;experience&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                    &quot;company&quot; : &quot;companyA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;positionExperience&quot; : &quot;positionA&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;descriptionExperience&quot; : &quot;descriptionA&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                    &quot;company&quot; : &quot;companyB&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;positionExperience&quot; : &quot;positionB&quot;,\r\n                    &quot;descriptionExperience&quot; : &quot;descriptionB&quot;\r\n            }\r\n      ]\r\n    }\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPersonally I would probably build more *smarts* into the front end in order to actually submit the data in a format I really want. But what you have with arrays on each property is actually typical of a standard `x-www-form-urlencoded` POST request, and if you don&#39;t yet want to spend the time in submitting a JSON request which actually aligns with what you want to store, then a transformation like above is generally your shortest path to getting it done.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58095849/how-to-set-an-index-when-creating-a-document-with-mongoose/58096839#58096839","title":"How to set an Index when creating a document with Mongoose"}],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":11225065,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2HX9N.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reinier68","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11225065/reinier68"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58096839,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569409029,"creation_date":1569405663,"question_id":58095849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58095849","body_markdown":"On the frontend of my app, the user is able to fill in a small form with his/her work experience.

In case you&#39;re not getting me, here&#39;s a [GIF](https://gyazo.com/ea4c1e2e506752d14d6a7710a1d4a620).\r\n\r\nBefore sending that form to the server, I convert everything into a ```FormData``` object. Considering I got a user that dynamically adds 1 form on top of the default one, this is what get&#39;s send to the server:\r\n\r\n**FIRST Work Experience**\r\n\r\n```[&quot;company&quot;, &quot;companyA&quot;]```\r\n\r\n```[&quot;positionExperience&quot;, &quot;positionA&quot;]```\r\n\r\n```[&quot;descriptionExperience&quot;, &quot;descriptionA&quot;]```\r\n\r\n**SECOND Work Experience**\r\n\r\n```[&quot;company&quot;, &quot;companyB&quot;]```\r\n\r\n```[&quot;positionExperience&quot;, &quot;positionB&quot;]```\r\n\r\n```[&quot;descriptionExperience&quot;, &quot;descriptionB&quot;]```\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn the backend of my app I got a post route to post the form to that looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\npersonRoutes.post(&#39;/new&#39;, upload.single(&#39;file&#39;), (req, res) =&gt; {\r\n    const person = new Person({\r\n        file: req.file.path,\r\n        experience: [\r\n            {\r\n                company: req.body.company,\r\n                positionExperience: req.body.positionExperience,\r\n                descriptionExperience: req.body.descriptionExperience,\r\n                websiteExperience: req.body.websiteExperience,\r\n                timeperiodExperience: req.body.timeperiodExperience,\r\n            }\r\n        ],\r\n    });\r\n    person.save()\r\n        .then()\r\n        .catch()\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**The problem** is that ```req.body``` on the server side, pushes the answers on both forms in an array. To demonstrate what I mean, this is a ```console.log``` of the ```req.body```\r\n\r\n```\r\nBODY:  [Object: null prototype] {\r\n   company: [ &#39;companyA&#39;, &#39;companyB&#39; ],\r\n   positionExperience: [ &#39;positionA&#39;, &#39;positionB&#39; ],\r\n   descriptionExperience: [ &#39;descriptionA&#39;, &#39;descriptionB&#39; ],\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo In my post route I somehow have to specify an **index** for the experience fields.

issue stems from the fact that `Helper.GetReview1Data()` and `        this.setState({review1data: data}) ` are asynchronous functions, but you are calling `this.get1Data()` synchronously afterwards.  This means the console.log will execute before you receive a response and set your state.\r\n\r\nTry placing `this.get1Data()` as a callback after you have set your state like so:\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     Helper.GetReview1Data().then(data =&gt;
