At least, all approaches I can think of will use _something similar_ to that under the hood.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is not clear what you mean by elegant, readability or performance? So I will just dump some approaches.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## `Stream` counting ##\r\n\r\nHere is a stream-variant that computes number of occurrences (`Map`) and then filters for elements that appear only once. It is essentially the same as what you described already, or what `Bag`s do under the hood:\r\n\r\n    List&lt;E&gt; result = elements.stream() // Stream&lt;E&gt;\r\n        .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Function.identity(), Collectors.counting())) // Map&lt;E, Long&gt;\r\n        .entries() // Set&lt;Entry&lt;E, Long&gt;&gt;\r\n        .stream()  // Stream&lt;Entry&lt;E, Long&gt;&gt;\r\n        .filter(entry -&gt; entry.getValue() == 1)\r\n        .map(Entry::getKey)\r\n        .collect(Collectors.toList());\r\n\r\nIt requires two full iterations over the data-set. Since it uses the Stream-API, the operations support multi-threading right from the get-go though. So if you have lots of elements, this might be pretty fast due to that.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n## Manual `Set` ##\r\n\r\nHere is another approach that reduces iteration and lookup time by manually collecting into a `Set` to identify duplicates as fast as possible:\r\n\r\n    Set&lt;E&gt; result = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n    Set&lt;E&gt; appeared = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\r\n    for (E element : elements) {\r\n        if (result.contains(element)) { // 2nd occurrence\r\n            result.remove(element);\r\n            appeared.add(element);\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n        if (appeared.contains(element)) { // &gt;2nd occurrence\r\n            continue;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        result.add(element); // 1st occurrence\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAs you see, this only requires one iteration over the `elements` instead of multiple.\r\n\r\nThis approach is elegant in a sense that it does not compute unnecessary information. For what you want, it is completely irrelevant to compute how often exactly elements appear.

directory to do further initialization before starting the service.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502835/docker-postgres-client-and-commands/58503020#58503020","title":"Docker postgres client and commands"}],"owner":{"reputation":1607,"user_id":1501582,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/houm9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Stefano Maglione","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1501582/stefano-maglione"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58503020,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571743014,"creation_date":1571742295,"question_id":58502835,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502835","body_markdown":"I am building a Dockerfile where I pull a postgresq client.

I want to compare property 1 or 2 from entity B to property 1 from entity A AND property 3 from entity B to property 2 from entity A.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502817/complex-join-on-multiple-fields","title":"Complex join on multiple fields"},{"tags":["redis"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32216,"user_id":3160475,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bd8989da0a2c491338617b07df53e60c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Itamar Haber","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3160475/itamar-haber"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571743100,"post_id":58502816,"comment_id":103334594,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502816/how-to-find-zonal-based-latency-in-redis-crdb#comment103334594_58502816"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":2685826,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac415ec41f60bd3fe47811aac1d13d9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ankit dixit","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2685826/ankit-dixit"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571742232,"creation_date":1571742232,"question_id":58502816,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502816","body_markdown":"I want to fins redis crdb latency based on zone. \r\nfor ex: zone1 writes and zone2 sync that data : latency in this operation. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502816/how-to-find-zonal-based-latency-in-redis-crdb","title":"How to find zonal based latency in redis crdb"},{"tags":["machine-learning"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5845136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1713519045533394/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shashank Kumar Mishra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5845136/shashank-kumar-mishra"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":5845136,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1713519045533394/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shashank Kumar Mishra","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5845136/shashank-kumar-mishra"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571753516,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571814029,"creation_date":1571742218,"last_edit_date":1571814029,"question_id":58502815,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502815","body_markdown":"\r\n I have to create a reusable library that can convert a paragraph of spoken english to written english.

Of course, the segments contain the docs.\r\n\r\nTo understand the concept of incremental, let&#39;s take the below example.\r\n\r\nSay there&#39;s an index called `my_index` with `1 primary shard (shard 0)`. As data gets written to the index, it will create segment file(s) for the shards.\r\n\r\nInitially, the index my_index may look like:\r\n\r\n    &quot;my_index&quot;\r\n    &quot;consists of shard 0&quot;\r\n    &quot;shard 0 consists of segements A,B,C&quot;\r\n\r\nYou take Snapshot S1 of index my_index at time T1.\r\n\r\nThe snapshot S1 contains the following metadata:\r\n\r\n    Index: my_index\r\n    Shards: 0\r\n    Segments: A,B,C\r\n    And then it will copy the segment files.\r\n\r\nNow, you index more data. ES merges segements B and C into a new segment D and adds new segment E for new data. \r\nOnce segments are merged, the old segments are deleted from the shard. Same way, when documents are deleted, segment merging happens\r\n\r\nNow the shard 0 of index my_index contains segments A,D,E\r\n\r\nYou take Snapshot S2 of index my_index at time T2.\r\nS2 will check to see what files it will need.\r\n\r\n    It will NOT copy segment A (because it already exists in the repo - this is what is meant by incremental). \r\n    It will copy segment D\r\n    it will copy segment E\r\n\r\nThe snapshot S2 contains the following metadata:\r\n\r\n    Index: my_index Shards: 0 Segments: A,D,E\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is incremental here?** \r\nThe incremental nature is for new segment files not necessarily for new data.\r\nFor Snapshot S2, segment A was NOT copied because it was already contained in S1. \r\n\r\n**When happens when you delete Snapshot S1?**  \r\n1. Segments B and C will be deleted since they are no longer being referenced  \r\n2. Exclude Segment A since it&#39;s being referenced by Snapshot S2\r\n\r\n**When happens when you delete index my_index?**  \r\nThe snapshots will still contain segement files pertaining to my_index allowing you to recover the index anytime. \r\n\r\n**What happens when documents are deleted?**\r\nWhen docs are deleted, eventually the segment files are merged, new segments are created. So when you take a snapshot after document has been deleted, the snapshot will not have the document. \r\n\r\nHope this helps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502754/how-does-elasticsearch-incremental-snapshots-deal-with-the-deleted-docs/58516488#58516488","title":"How does Elasticsearch incremental snapshots deal with the deleted docs?"}],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":11432290,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rkURtALDrWM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rfjEqHuEE5qFpDRYYf3QylaIR_g6Q/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Yash Tandon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11432290/yash-tandon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571820889,"creation_date":1571742028,"question_id":58502754,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502754","body_markdown":"I regularly take a snapshot of my ES cluster in a s3 bucket and so i wanted to know that if i am deleting my old docs from the cluster and regularly adding new docs then after taking a snapshot how does ES deal with this scenario wheather the docs get deleted from my previous snapshots as well or how does ES keep a backup of my docs.

command as mentioned in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_loading-tables-from-s3.html.\r\nlike \r\n\r\n    copy customer \r\n    from &#39;s3://mybucket/mydata&#39; \r\n    access_key_id &#39;&lt;access-key-id&gt;&#39;\r\n    secret_access_key &#39;&lt;secret-access-key&#39;;\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using **Psycopg2** to connect to Redshift.\r\n\r\nBut I also need to load the data that is present in S3 to another Postgres DB not the Redshift.\r\nThe only difference is the pattern for the new Postgres DB, the pattern of files will be like\r\n`prediction{processingID}`-*.csv. Here also I&#39;m using **Psycopg2** to connect to new Postgres DB.\r\n\r\nCan I use the same **COPY** command that I used for copying from S3 to Redshift for copying from S3 to the new Postgres DB?\r\n\r\nCan I execute the same COPY command on the new Postgres DB connection and just change the file and table names for loading data? Will it work?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502753/can-we-load-csv-data-from-s3-to-redshift-and-rds-using-same-copy-command","title":"Can we load CSV data from S3 to Redshift and RDS using same COPY command?"},{"tags":["flutter","dart","flutter-layout","flutter-widget"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2416,"user_id":3718908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4f90109cc5f7b46d1ef13f800c0f74d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3718908","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718908/user3718908"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571742263,"post_id":58502748,"comment_id":103334146,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502748/flutter-how-to-make-a-widget-be-created-when-its-scrolled-onto-the-screen#comment103334146_58502748"},{"owner":{"reputation":1927,"user_id":11938462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFyyJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pablo Barrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938462/pablo-barrera"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2416,"user_id":3718908,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4f90109cc5f7b46d1ef13f800c0f74d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3718908","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3718908/user3718908"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571742424,"post_id":58502748,"comment_id":103334235,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502748/flutter-how-to-make-a-widget-be-created-when-its-scrolled-onto-the-screen#comment103334235_58502748"}],"owner":{"reputation":1927,"user_id":11938462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFyyJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pablo Barrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938462/pablo-barrera"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1927,"user_id":11938462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/RFyyJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pablo Barrera","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11938462/pablo-barrera"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571742280,"creation_date":1571742007,"last_edit_date":1571742280,"question_id":58502748,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502748","body_markdown":"I created a custom widget that adds a footer as last item to a received scrollable widget. Everything works fine, but I want to change the time the footer is being created.\r\n\r\nLike `ListView.builder` creates items as they&#39;re scrolled onto the screen, I want that happen with the footer too. If this custom widget receives a `ListView.builder`, their items are being created fine as they&#39;re scrolled onto the screen, but the footer is created the first time even if it&#39;s not on the screen.\r\n\r\nHere is the custom widget, where the received widget is `widget.child` (`ScrollView`) and the footer is `widget.footer` (`Widget`).\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n      return Scrollable(\r\n        controller: widget.child.controller,\r\n        axisDirection: widget.child.getDirection(context),\r\n        viewportBuilder: (context, offset) {\r\n          return ShrinkWrappingViewport(\r\n            axisDirection: widget.child.getDirection(context),\r\n            offset: offset,\r\n            slivers: widget.child.buildSlivers(context)\r\n              ..add(\r\n                  SliverList(\r\n                      delegate: SliverChildBuilderDelegate((context, index) {\r\n                print(&#39;footer&#39;);\r\n                return widget.footer;\r\n              }, childCount: 1))),\r\n          );\r\n        },\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is how I&#39;m using it:\r\n\r\n    ScrollableWithFooter(\r\n      child: ListView.builder(\r\n        itemCount: 50,\r\n        itemBuilder: (context, index) {\r\n          print(index);\r\n          return SizedBox(height: 400, child: Text(&#39;Item $index&#39;));\r\n        },\r\n      ),\r\n      footer: Center(child: Text(&#39;Footer&#39;)),\r\n    )\r\n\r\nWith a list of 50, I&#39;m seeing the first items on the screen and this is the output of the prints:\r\n\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 0\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 1\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 2\r\n    I/flutter (28472): footer\r\n\r\nAnd when I start scrolling, the other items start printing their indexes as they&#39;re created:\r\n\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 2\r\n    I/flutter (28472): footer\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 3\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 4\r\n    I/flutter (28472): 5\r\n\r\nThis is correct for the items but not for the footer. I want the footer to be created when I reached the end of the list, like the other items. How can achieve that?\r\n\r\n*Note that on the screen everything works fine, the footer appears at the end of the list.

But it does not work as expected. See he attached picture. Let me recall:\r\n I know someone is corruption the 0x7000c0de position, writing a 0x0000 instead of the expected value 0x7000. I use that as a pointer and the resulted pointer is 0x000022A5 instead of the expected 0x700022A5. I&#39;ve setup 2 breakpoints , one at the trap function (I fall here after trying to access to the bad address) and a conditional Write breakpoint which should stop only when some writes the 0x0000 and additionaly the 0x7000c0dc address content is 0x000022A5. As you see in the picture my debugger stops only in the TRap function and at that moment the content of the 0x7000c0dc is effectively 0x000022A5. So why this conditional breakpoint is not working?\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/KWsE7.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502742/conditional-breakpoint-with-trace32","title":"Conditional breakpoint with trace32"},{"tags":["ruby-on-rails","ruby","csv"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3402,"user_id":2037537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f13d953be3af2552aaa1ddfa0a05fa46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roland Studer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2037537/roland-studer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3402,"user_id":2037537,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f13d953be3af2552aaa1ddfa0a05fa46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Roland Studer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2037537/roland-studer"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":5,"is_accepted":true,"score":5,"last_activity_date":1571743632,"last_edit_date":1571743632,"creation_date":1571742994,"answer_id":58503064,"question_id":58502741,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58503064","body_markdown":"You can deliver different formats of a view from a single controller action.\r\n\r\n    class SubmissionsController &lt; ApplicationController\r\n      def index\r\n        @submissions = Submission.submissions_for(user: current_user)\r\n\r\n        respond_to do |format|\r\n          format.html\r\n          format.csv { send_data @submissions.to_csv, filename: &quot;users-#{Date.today}.csv&quot; }\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThen if you do the request with `.csv` it will deliver the csv instead of the view.\r\n\r\nTo get the right url use the url_helper as follows:\r\n\r\n    link_to &#39;CSV Export&#39;, submissions_path(format: :csv)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502741/idiomatic-csv-export-in-rails/58503064#58503064","title":"Idiomatic CSV export in Rails"}],"owner":{"reputation":3007,"user_id":5650878,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xh7BI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Bitwise","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5650878/bitwise"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":34,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58503064,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571743632,"creation_date":1571741968,"question_id":58502741,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58502741","body_markdown":"I have an index view of `submissions` and in the view I have `@submissions` the controller looks like this:\r\n\r\n### Submissions Controller\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndef index \r\n  @submissions = Submission.submissions_for(user: current_user)\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the view I want to essentially click a button and pass in that list of `submissions`\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve thought of adding a new route like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n&lt;%= link_to &quot;Export&quot;, export_submissions_path(submissions: @submissions) %&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that doesn&#39;t feel quite right because I need to stay on the index page.

I tried below link\r\n\r\nhttps://www.odoo.com/forum/help-1/question/how-to-approve-a-record-through-email-120980\r\n​\r\n\r\nI want to know what we have to send in href of a button or link. Then how will it call the appropriate function in model or controller to do some task there. Actually I want to change the state of the record and send an email to the manager/user there.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58502723/approve-button-in-mail-should-approve-the-record-odoo-v10","title":"Approve Button in Mail should approve the record?

you are trying to do is get `stdin` back to your control (terminal input) after a redirection. According to the [C-FAQ](http://c-faq.com/stdio/devtty.html) you can&#39;t do it in a portable way:\r\n\r\n&gt;There is no portable way of doing this. **Under Unix, you can open the special file /dev/tty**. Under MS-DOS, you can try opening the ``file&#39;&#39; CON, or use routines or BIOS calls such as getch which may go to the keyboard whether or not input is redirected. \r\n\r\nBut, if portability is not an issue, we can try a little work around (not optimal):\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[])\r\n    {\r\n    \tchar buf[1001], fname[10];\r\n    \tFILE *fp;\r\n    \tint i = 0;\r\n    \r\n    \twhile(1) {\r\n    \t\tif(fgets(buf, 1000, stdin)) {\r\n    \t\t\tsprintf(fname, &quot;mf%d&quot;, i++);\r\n    \t\t\t\r\n    \t\t\tif(!(fp = fopen(fname, &quot;w&quot;))) {\r\n    \t\t\t\tperror(&quot;fopen&quot;);\r\n    \t\t\t\tcontinue;\r\n    \t\t\t}\r\n    \r\n    \t\t\tfprintf(fp, buf);\r\n    \t\t\tfclose(fp);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tif(!(stdin = fopen(&quot;/dev/tty&quot;, &quot;r&quot;))) {\r\n    \t\t\tperror(&quot;stdin&quot;);\r\n    \t\t\texit(0);\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \treturn 0;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe thing is, when you run the program, go to another terminal and get it&#39;s PID (`ps aux | grep myprog`). Say the PID is 12345 Then you do `ls -la /proc/12345/fd` and you&#39;ll see that the descriptor 0 is a pipe (done by the shell).
