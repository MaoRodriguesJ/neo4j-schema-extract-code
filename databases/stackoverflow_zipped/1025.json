As a result, on the **.NET Framework only**, different Random objects that are created in close succession by a call to the parameterless constructor will have identical default seed values and, therefore, will produce identical sets of random numbers. [... ] **Note that this limitation does not apply to .NET Core.**\r\n\r\nSo it looks like this was basically fixed in Core. But it wasn&#39;t *always* fixed in Core. I&#39;ve just created a test project targeting multiple frameworks, adding a bit of warmup code to avoid JIT delays changing the seed for the next iteration, and it looks like .NET Core 1.x had the same issue as the desktop framework. It was fixed for 2.0, I suspect.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298730/why-initializing-new-system-random-doesnt-produce-the-same-output/58298795#58298795","title":"Why initializing new System.Random DOESN&#39;T produce the same output?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":10522960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4456f6ef58742daecc7cca0b6097edee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joelty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10522960/joelty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570605936,"post_id":58298971,"comment_id":102960773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298730/why-initializing-new-system-random-doesnt-produce-the-same-output/58298971#comment102960773_58298971"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":459,"user_id":10522960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4456f6ef58742daecc7cca0b6097edee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joelty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10522960/joelty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570606031,"post_id":58298971,"comment_id":102960816,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298730/why-initializing-new-system-random-doesnt-produce-the-same-output/58298971#comment102960816_58298971"},{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":10522960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4456f6ef58742daecc7cca0b6097edee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joelty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10522960/joelty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570606052,"post_id":58298971,"comment_id":102960832,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298730/why-initializing-new-system-random-doesnt-produce-the-same-output/58298971#comment102960832_58298971"},{"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":459,"user_id":10522960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4456f6ef58742daecc7cca0b6097edee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Joelty","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10522960/joelty"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570606060,"post_id":58298971,"comment_id":102960838,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298730/why-initializing-new-system-random-doesnt-produce-the-same-output/58298971#comment102960838_58298971"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"last_editor":{"reputation":66544,"user_id":134204,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vwnA5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Panagiotis Kanavos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/134204/panagiotis-kanavos"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570606156,"last_edit_date":1570606156,"creation_date":1570605693,"answer_id":58298971,"question_id":58298730,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298971","body_markdown":"That code is bad to begin with - RNG algorithms use the previous N values to generate random numbers with good randomness characteristics. \r\n\r\nUnless a seed is provided, most RNGs will use something like the processors&#39; tick count or clock, which is a *strictly incrementing* number as the seed. This alone reduces the randomness of the generated numbers. That&#39;s why some cryptographic tools require you to move the mouse around to generate a random initial sequence. Simplistic implementations may even use a hard-coded seed.\r\n\r\nThat said, the processor&#39;s clock has a finite resolution. If the loop executes quickly enough, several RNG objects may end up receiving the same seed value. \r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll get into the same problem if you try to implement a sequential GUID algorithm using the tick count instead of using Windows API&#39;s functions. \r\n\r\nThe *correct* way to generate good random numbers is to create `Random` once and reuse it :\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar rnd = new Random();\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine(rnd.Next(10));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf on the other hand you want to generate reproducible number sequences for use eg in data science experiments, you need to specify the seed explicitly :\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)\r\n{\r\n    Thread.Sleep(100);\r\n    var rnd = new Random(1023);\r\n    Console.WriteLine(rnd.Next(10));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis produces `1` consistently, even though there&#39;s a delay\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\n.NET 4.8 [still has this bug](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/random.cs,52).

The HTML &lt;a&gt; element (or anchor element), along with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.\r\n\r\nI would consider a modal a location within the same page. In fact, if you were to be talking about a PWA (Progressive web app) and general usability I would suggest that your modal have a specific URL, which makes an `a` even more relevant.\r\n\r\nFinally, from a usability perspective, buttons should look like buttons (within limits). I would say disguising one as a link is worse than using an `a`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298708/how-to-style-button-to-look-like-a-a/58299665#58299665","title":"How to style &lt;button&gt; to look like a &lt;a&gt;?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":122,"user_id":12149235,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBU5j5OfTdOPrTFctfGq6FV63OIkXfQNyjmo772=k-s128=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"yosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12149235/yosh"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570608914,"creation_date":1570608914,"answer_id":58299778,"question_id":58298708,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58299778","body_markdown":"See here: &lt;https://stackoverflow.com/a/1368286/12149235&gt;\r\n\r\nA more effective version of the link above is:\r\n\r\n    button {\r\n      background: none!important;\r\n      border: none;\r\n      padding: 0!important;\r\n      text-decoration: underline;\r\n      cursor: pointer;\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298708/how-to-style-button-to-look-like-a-a/58299778#58299778","title":"How to style &lt;button&gt; to look like a &lt;a&gt;?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11258611,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42d729ba9c143e4bed381f7b78a951e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"paneko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11258611/paneko"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11258611,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42d729ba9c143e4bed381f7b78a951e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"paneko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11258611/paneko"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":93,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":4,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570608914,"creation_date":1570604612,"last_edit_date":1570604959,"question_id":58298708,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298708","body_markdown":"Given the following snippet:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    div {\r\n      width: 150px;\r\n      line-height: 1.5;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    a,\r\n    button {\r\n      background: red;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    button {\r\n      display: inline;\r\n      font-size: inherit;\r\n      font-family: inherit;\r\n      padding: 0;\r\n      margin: 0;\r\n      border: none;\r\n      text-align: left;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n      Some text\r\n      &lt;a&gt;\r\n        &lt;span&gt;abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi&lt;/span&gt;\r\n      &lt;/a&gt;\r\n      Some text\r\n\r\n      &lt;br /&gt;\r\n      &lt;br /&gt; Some text\r\n      &lt;button&gt;\r\n        &lt;span&gt;abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi abcdefghi&lt;/span&gt;\r\n      &lt;/button&gt; Some text\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nHow would I make it so that the second block with `&lt;button&gt;` as a wrapper looks identical to the one with `&lt;a&gt;` as a wrapper?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m trying to make a in-text button to open a modal and problem occurs when the text wraps to a newline.

There is a DB.php class which handles database execution. It contains a function called connect(), which connects to the database. Inside this connect, apart from spawning a new connection, it also calls two additional function that does something like - \r\n\r\n    ALTER SESSION SET NLS_DATE_FORMAT = &lt;something&gt;\r\n    ALTER SESSION SET NLS_SORT = &lt;something&gt;\r\n\r\nThe problem is that these two functions are explicitly committing the transactions to the DB right after ALTERing the SESSION. This has a side-effect wherein, any transaction prior to connect will also be committed. \r\n\r\nWe usually don&#39;t commit sql queries until the end of a request, after checking for all validations being right.\r\n\r\nAlso, in any given call stack there are multiple places where DB.php is instantiated and connect is called. In php, when calling oci_connect with same parameters, it will return the same connection if it already exists. Therefore, in some instances this connect function is committing transactions which are not to be committed.\r\n\r\nI have tried to get around this problem but my workarounds are an overkill to the problem. My question really is that, ***Is it necessary to commit after ALTERing SESSIONs in php-&gt;oracle?***\r\n\r\nSpent an awful lot of time fixing it in other ways and also, I tried looking this up on the internet and didn&#39;t really find an answer where this *commit* scenario is taken into consideration.

&quot;the answer&quot;)\r\n\r\nAs I was expecting, the problem is caused by the PK definition of the entity. By marking ID_A as PK essentially you are telling EF that this field is unique, hence it will assume any combination of fields including that field as unique, and will remove the normal GroupBy / Distinct operator. You really need to define a real unique key as PK for that entity. Eventually including all fields, but that doesn&#39;t work with nullable fields. Better extend the database view to include ROW_NUMBER or NEWID based calculated column and map it as PK. – Ivan Stoev Oct 10 at 15:58","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298701/selecting-distinct-rows-in-entity-framework/58386767#58386767","title":"Selecting distinct rows in Entity Framework"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":10998602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30cac0cb9b484469da50f376710c863?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10998602","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10998602/user10998602"},"last_editor":{"reputation":13,"user_id":10998602,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b30cac0cb9b484469da50f376710c863?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user10998602","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10998602/user10998602"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":106,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58386767,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571109616,"creation_date":1570604559,"last_edit_date":1570680858,"question_id":58298701,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298701","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to query an SQL Server view with Entity Framework and only return rows that are distinct based on multiple columns.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a solution based on [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3542285) (`GroupBy` and then `Select(g =&gt; g.FirstOrDefault())`, but I&#39;m still getting duplicate rows.\r\n\r\nTable structure (this is a fairly complex view in the real database, but the final output is similar in structure to this example):\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE Example (\r\n\tID_A BIGINT,\r\n\tID_B BIGINT,\r\n\tID_C BIGINT,\r\n\r\n\tType_A NVARCHAR(50),\r\n\tType_B NVARCHAR(50),\r\n\r\n\tID_Z BIGINT,\r\n\r\n\tFoo NVARCHAR(200),\r\n\tBar NVARCHAR(200)\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample data:\r\n```sql\r\nINSERT INTO Example (ID_A, ID_B, ID_C, Type_A, Type_B,  ID_Z,  Foo, Bar)\r\nVALUES (1, 1, 1, &#39;TypeA1&#39;, &#39;TypeB1&#39;,  1,  &#39;foo1&#39;, &#39;bar1&#39;), -- This row and the next one represent the same main record (1) joined to different &quot;Z&quot; records (1 and 2)\r\n       (1, 1, 1, &#39;TypeA1&#39;, &#39;TypeB1&#39;,  2,  &#39;foo1&#39;, &#39;bar1&#39;),\r\n       (2, 1, 2, &#39;TypeA2&#39;, &#39;TypeA2&#39;,  1,  &#39;foo2&#39;, &#39;bar2&#39;), -- This row and the next two represent the same main record (2) joined to different &quot;Z&quot; records (1, 2 and 3)\r\n       (2, 1, 2, &#39;TypeA2&#39;, &#39;TypeA2&#39;,  2,  &#39;foo2&#39;, &#39;bar2&#39;),\r\n       (2, 1, 2, &#39;TypeA2&#39;, &#39;TypeA2&#39;,  3,  &#39;foo2&#39;, &#39;bar2&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEntity class:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ExampleEntity\r\n{\r\n    [Key]\r\n    public long ID_A { get; set; }\r\n    public long ID_B { get; set; }\r\n    public long ID_C { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public string Type_A { get; set; }\r\n    public string Type_B { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public long?

created a page in Django which serves images of a specific car into a gallery slider like [this][1].\r\n\r\nIt seems that the View doesn&#39;t even recognize the fotorama gallery. The ```&lt;div class=&quot;fotorama&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;``` shows up in the inspect console, but the images are still spread out in html&#39;s default layout.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m hosting the fotorama.js and .css locally since they didn&#39;t work when served via CDN. \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n...\r\n    {% load static %}\r\n    &lt;link  href=&quot;{% static &#39;css/fotorama.css&#39; %}&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;{% static &#39;js/fotorama.js&#39; %}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n&lt;/head&gt;\r\n...\r\n\r\n(jQuery comes with bootstrap and I know that it&#39;s working. And I&#39;ve run collectstatic, so that&#39;s not the problem)\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;col justify-content-center&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;fotorama&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/placeholder.jpg&quot;&gt;\r\n                    {% for image in car.image_set.all %}\r\n                        &lt;img src=&quot;{{ image.image.url }}&quot;&gt;\r\n                    {% endfor %}\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nJust as a quick test, I served a normal image outside of all the other container, row, and col divs. It also didn&#39;t make a difference. \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;fotorama&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;img src=&quot;/static/images/placeholder.jpg&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is what the page looks like:\r\n\r\n[![Demonstration image][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI made a quick page outside my django project, and fotorama works perfectly. Could this be a django-specific issue? Is there an extra plugin/extra code I need to make the slider work? \r\n\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nI added some js code to try and manually initialize the fotorama code from the [API][3]. \r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n  $(function () {\r\n    // 1. Initialize fotorama manually.\r\n    var $fotoramaDiv = $(&#39;#fotorama&#39;).fotorama();\r\n\r\n    // 2. Get the API object.\r\n    var fotorama = $fotoramaDiv.data(&#39;fotorama&#39;);\r\n\r\n    // 3. Inspect it in console.\r\n    console.log(fotorama);\r\n  });\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhile it doesn&#39;t make a difference(the images still aren&#39;t being added to a slider) there&#39;s this console error:\r\n\r\n``` \r\n(index) : 82 Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined\r\n    at (index) : 82\r\n(anonymous) @ (index) : 82 \r\n```\r\n(Line 82 is where the script code begins, and colon spacing added for formatting)\r\n\r\nThere weren&#39;t any errors being printed to the console before I added the js scripts, could this mean that fotorama and other js scripts aren&#39;t even being recognized?\r\n\r\n**Update 2**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve been reading previous Stack questions about this topic, and I&#39;ve taken some steps to get more errors printed into the console, because visible errors are better than silence.\r\n\r\nI moved the href from the head to the bottom of the body, and this error popped up. \r\n\r\n```\r\nGET http://localhost:8000/static/js/fotorama.js net::ERR_ABORTED 404 (Not Found)\r\n```\r\n... which is the correct path to the file.\r\n\r\nSo I moved it back to the original CDN link:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fotorama/4.6.4/fotorama.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n``` \r\n\r\nWhich gets clears up the error.\r\n\r\n**A Somewhat success**\r\nI found a script to check if the jQuery had loaded.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n    if(typeof jQuery!==&#39;undefined&#39;){\r\n        console.log(&#39;jQuery Loaded&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n    else{\r\n        console.log(&#39;not loaded yet&#39;);\r\n    }\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nWhich the console returns &#39;not loaded yet&#39;, even though it&#39;s posted at the bottom of the HTML page.\r\n\r\nHowever, while the images are still stacked, they now respond to clicks and drags as a slider would, and the text below them (description paragraphs), now cover all bu the first one. Which is still progress.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://fotorama.io/examples/basic/\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XkWWV.png\r\n  [3]: https://fotorama.io/docs/4/api/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298699/how-do-i-put-django-images-into-a-jquery-gallery-slider","title":"How do I put Django images into a jQuery gallery slider?"},{"tags":["bash","shell"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11193,"user_id":9952196,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10216835866235879/picture?type=large","display_name":"Shawn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9952196/shawn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570606689,"post_id":58298695,"comment_id":102961197,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298695/i-want-to-watch-a-directory-for-changes-if-new-file-is-arrives-and-send-a-mail-w#comment102961197_58298695"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":363,"user_id":5064780,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-tlDlUrH63r0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAC4/MkJrjlKpR-Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"binbjz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5064780/binbjz"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570605591,"creation_date":1570605591,"answer_id":58298944,"question_id":58298695,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298944","body_markdown":"For the first time we can scan directory and archive the scan results. after \r\nthat if there is update, delete, or a new file or directory is created.\r\n\r\nWe can use this benchmark archive data for comparison and then We can then determine if the contents of the current directory have been updated.\r\n\r\nwe can use the file block size or md5 depending on what you want.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a simpler way to do it, and you can also update it to use other methods of monitoring.\r\n\r\n    if [ &quot;$#&quot;

Both master and replica node is configured to avoid persistence.\r\n\r\nAt master, disk-backed replication is enabled, which is by default. Therefore when replica node requests for synchronization, master node creates a rdb file sends to the replica. Replica node loads this into it&#39;s memory.\r\n\r\nAs per the excerpt from the Redis replication document (https://redis.io/topics/replication)\r\n\r\n&gt; It is possible to use replication to avoid the cost of having the\r\n&gt; master writing the full dataset to disk: a typical technique involves\r\n&gt; configuring your master redis.conf to avoid persisting to disk at all,\r\n&gt; then connect a slave configured to save from time to time, or with AOF\r\n&gt; enabled. However this setup must be handled with care, since a\r\n&gt; restarting master will start with an empty dataset: if the slave tries\r\n&gt; to synchronized with it, the slave will be emptied as well.\r\n\r\nHence as per this notes, when master node is restarted, it is supposed to have an empty dataset.\r\nBut the observation is when the 2nd node issued a sync request earlier, both master and replica Redis node had rdb file saved as part of disk backed replication and now when the master restarts it loads this RDB file.\r\n\r\nThis statement therefore is little ambiguous. Is this a limitation in Redis or a configuration issue?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298664/ambiguity-in-redis-replication-behavior","title":"Ambiguity in Redis replication behavior"},{"tags":["html","angularjs"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7142,"user_id":5621827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DQqw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jitender","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5621827/jitender"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7142,"user_id":5621827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DQqw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jitender","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5621827/jitender"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570605028,"last_edit_date":1570605028,"creation_date":1570604696,"answer_id":58298718,"question_id":58298662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298718","body_markdown":"you can use [ng-change][1] event on your input and set `duplicateStepName` as false\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; class=&quot;form-control&quot; id=&quot;step_definition_name&quot; name=&quot;step_definition_name&quot; ng-change=&quot;change()&quot; required ng-disabled=&quot;vm.stepDefinition.canDelete == false&quot; ng-model=&quot;vm.stepDefinition.name&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nthen in controller\r\n\r\n    $scope.change=function(){\r\n      $scope.duplicateStepName=false\r\n    }\r\n\r\n[demo][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngChange\r\n  [2]: https://jsfiddle.net/29wk8dxf/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298662/angular-validation-message-to-be-hidden-on-editing-input/58298718#58298718","title":"Angular validation message to be hidden on editing input"}],"owner":{"reputation":5305,"user_id":166012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Nq3V7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ckv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/166012/ckv"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2560,"user_id":2642250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ba7027677ae3831af9f0d0f5bf66f0d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sheplu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2642250/sheplu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570653270,"creation_date":1570604395,"last_edit_date":1570653270,"question_id":58298662,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298662","body_markdown":"I have the following html content in my page.

is an obvious stack overflow. S08 is an incredibly resource-constrained 8 bit MCU. It is not a PC. It does not have a FPU. This means that you _cannot and should not use floating point arithmetic, ever_. Period. And avoid using 32 bit arithemtic in general.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when you roll up math.h is that Codewarrior injects a bombastic software floating point lib, completely slaughtering all the available memory and CPU resources in the whole MCU, turning your program into a useless mess. One single `log` call was apparently enough to kill the stack. I&#39;m not surprised, you have some 100-200 bytes of stack per default. And when that happens, the stack overflows into the `.data`/`.bss` memory areas where the variables `x` and `Temp` are stored, destroying it while writing gibberish in those areas.\r\n\r\nIf you actually _need_ to use floating point calculations, then tough luck, you picked the wrong MCU. Should have picked a Cortex M4.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you should always place the stack so that it grows (it&#39;s a down-counting SP) into harmless memory areas, not into the `.data`/`.bss` sections. Why Codewarrior doesn&#39;t do this as default is very strange. Having the stack grow into the register map isn&#39;t ideal either, but in case you aren&#39;t using all the timer peripherals around 0x70 then it&#39;s at least a less bad scenario than corrupting all variables in the program.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298660/global-variable-is-smashed/58302606#58302606","title":"Global variable is smashed"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7834613,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10213139144973459/picture?type=large","display_name":"Kotito Otitok","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7834613/kotito-otitok"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570689842,"creation_date":1570689842,"answer_id":58316951,"question_id":58298660,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58316951","body_markdown":"Somehow I came up with a possible solution.

Before putting the two graphs together, I think your code may have some issues: 1) your `cumsum(abs(x)/sum(abs(x)))` may not be correct, I replaced it with `cumsum(abs(10-x)/sum(abs(10-x)))`. \r\nSecond, for binomial distribution, `rbinom(1e5,1e5, 0.001)` will give you numbers not probabilities, I replaced it with `rbinom(1e5,1e5, 0.001)/1e5`. \r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\ndf1&lt;-tibble(x = sort(rnorm(1e5)),\r\n       cumulative = cumsum(abs(10-x)/sum(abs(10-x)))/2.5)\r\ndf2&lt;-tibble(x1 = sort(rbinom(1e5,1e5, 0.001)/1e5)) \r\n\r\n  ggplot(df1, aes(x=x)) + \r\n  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 500)+\r\n  geom_density(color = &quot;red&quot;)+\r\n  geom_line(aes(y = cumulative), color = &quot;navy&quot;)+\r\n  scale_y_continuous(sec.axis = sec_axis(~.*2.5, name = &quot;cumulative density&quot;)) + \r\n    geom_histogram(data = df2, aes(x = x1, y = ..density..), bins = 90) \r\n```\r\n    \r\nThis will produce: \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can change `bins` to adjust height.

When using inheritance for models put\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        abstract = True\r\n\r\nin your base model, which is `Object` in your case so that it doesn&#39;t create its own instance/table. So in this case your model will look like\r\n\r\n    class Object(models.Model):\r\n        author = models.ForeignKey(ProfileUser, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n        title = models.CharField(max_length=300)\r\n        address = models.CharField(max_length=300)\r\n        content = models.TextField()\r\n        created_date = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)\r\n        approved_object = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n        admin_seen = models.BooleanField(default=False)\r\n        \r\n        class Meta:\r\n            abstract = True\r\n\r\n        def __str__(self):\r\n            return f&quot;{self.title}&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nOn other note rename `Object` to something else like `BaseModel` or something.\r\n \r\n2: When you&#39;re calling doing `show_object` pass the category/name of the model &amp; query on that, eg:\r\n\r\n&gt;     obj = Object.objects.get(id=5) #Instead of this\r\n&gt;     obj = eval(categories[category]).objects.get(pk=pk) # Do this\r\n\r\n   \r\n3: For your `Comment` model, either you add bunch of foreign keys for each of your model or you can use [Generic Relation in Django][1].\r\n\r\n4: While showing forms use respective models not `Object` model. You anyways have access to all the fields because you&#39;re inheriting from it.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I&#39;ve answered all of your questions, if not let me know.\r\n\r\nUpdate:\r\nRegarding you *not being able to pass category from template*, in your views pass category also to the template\r\n\r\n    def show_all_objects(request, category):\r\n        categories = {&#39;restaurants&#39; : &#39;Restaurant&#39;, &#39;sportfitness&#39; : &#39;SportFitness&#39;, &#39;carservice&#39; : &#39;CarService&#39;, &#39;beautysalon&#39; : &#39;BeautySalon&#39;, &#39;fastfood&#39; : &#39;FastFood&#39;, &#39;carwash&#39;

render(request, &#39;show_all_objects.html&#39;, context)\r\n\r\nEverything was fine until I had to show objects for each category, like this (I&#39;m using restaurants instead of Restaurant, because url looks much better):\r\n\r\n      &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;show-all-objects&#39; category=&#39;restaurants&#39; %}&quot; class=&quot;utf_category_small_box_part&quot;&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;im im-icon-Chef&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;h4&gt;Ресторантии&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;span&gt;22&lt;/span&gt;\r\n      &lt;/a&gt;\r\n      &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;show-all-objects&#39; category=&#39;sportfitness&#39; %}&quot; class=&quot;utf_category_small_box_part&quot;&gt; &lt;i class=&quot;im im-icon-Dumbbell&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;h4&gt;Спортни и фитнес&lt;/h4&gt;\r\n\t\t&lt;span&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;\r\n      &lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\n You can check `show_all_objects` function, so I did it with `eval()`:\r\n\r\n    categories = {&#39;restaurants&#39; : &#39;Restaurant&#39;, &#39;sportfitness&#39; : &#39;SportFitness&#39;, &#39;carservice&#39; : &#39;CarService&#39;, &#39;beautysalon&#39; : &#39;BeautySalon&#39;, &#39;fastfood&#39; : &#39;FastFood&#39;, &#39;carwash&#39; : &#39;CarWash&#39;, &#39;fun&#39; : &#39;Fun&#39;, &#39;other&#39; : &#39;Other&#39;}\r\n    objects = eval(categories[category]).objects.all()\r\n\r\nIt was fine, but then I faced this problem again. When I want to show an object with its features in `show_object()`-method (you can check it in code above), I can get the object, but I cannot get `restaurant` for example, or `car wash` etc:\r\n\r\n    def show_object(request, pk):\r\n        obj = Object.objects.get(id=5)\r\n\r\nNow I have the object, but I cannot get the exact object. I get the same problem again when I want to show a different form for each type of object (for example restaurants should have a form with checkboxes with its features, carwashes form with checkboxes for its features etc).\r\n\r\n**P.S:** Based on **@Saawhat** answer, he recommends me to use `eval()` in `show_object()` function, but I foreach all ojbects in template, so I cannot pass param like category to it:\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;row&quot;&gt;\r\n        {% for object in object_list %}\r\n          &lt;div class=&quot;col-lg-12 col-md-12&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;utf_listing_item-container list-layout&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;show-object&#39; category=&#39;&#39; pk=object.id%}&quot;  class=&quot;utf_listing_item&quot;&gt;\r\n              &lt;div class=&quot;utf_listing_item-image&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;img src=&quot;{% static &#39;core/images/utf_listing_item-01.jpg&#39; %}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;span class=&quot;like-icon&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;span class=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;im im-icon-Hotel&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Hotels&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;div class=&quot;utf_listing_prige_block utf_half_list&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;utf_meta_listing_price&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; $25 - $45&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                    &lt;span class=&quot;utp_approve_item&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;utf_approve_listing&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;div class=&quot;utf_listing_item_content&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;utf_listing_item-inner&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;h3&gt;{{ object.title }}&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n                  &lt;span&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;sl sl-icon-location&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt; {{ object.address }}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                  &lt;p&gt;{{ object.content }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;\r\n              &lt;/a&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n          &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        {% endfor %}\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nThis row: \r\n\r\n    &lt;a href=&quot;{% url &#39;show-object&#39; category=&#39;&#39; pk=object.id%}&quot;\r\n\r\nI cannot pass category, because I don&#39;t have one","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298613/proper-implementation-of-django-model-inheritance-architecture","title":"Proper implementation of Django model inheritance architecture?"},{"tags":["python","pyaudio"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":410,"user_id":8733066,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qa3Wd9oo7MA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACOo/KW8DPGJLEXs/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sadap","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8733066/sadap"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570609516,"post_id":58298611,"comment_id":102962602,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298611/i-cant-use-pyaudio-in-python-3-7-2#comment102962602_58298611"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12186382,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/65b6ab586df9fd49f62b81ef50da1274?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LickyLizard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12186382/lickylizard"},"last_editor":{"reputation":856,"user_id":7031374,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e7659ba8c1b8d7ca94fbbea972be8946?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erik Šťastn&#253;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7031374/erik-%c5%a0%c5%a5astn%c3%bd"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570616803,"creation_date":1570604214,"last_edit_date":1570616803,"question_id":58298611,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298611","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve started messing around with audio and sound.

I don&#39;t know how to use Kafka in java. in ReadLg.java I want to read from the log file and insert it into DB and then when it finished I want to send a message to the RetrieveData.java so it can start. the retrieve data will be run but idle waiting for the message from the ReadLg.java. Is this a bad approach? or the old approach? any suggestions or help on fixing this? I keep getting error can&#39;t connect to the IP address&lt;br&gt;\r\nBelow is the error message:\r\n\r\n    14:23:00.482 [kafka-producer-network-thread | producer-1] DEBUG org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient -

However, the kibana endpoint when visited, will redirect to `http://&lt;kibana-ip&gt;/app/kibana` As a result, when I go to the above HTTP server, I am not getting redirected to the kibana homepage.\r\n\r\nIf I vist, `http://&lt;go-program&gt;/kibana`, the logs say:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2019/10/09 12:10:28 Forwarding to http://104.196.209.244:5601\r\n2019/10/09 12:10:28 &amp;url.URL{Scheme:&quot;&quot;, Opaque:&quot;&quot;, User:(*url.Userinfo)(nil), Host:&quot;&quot;, Path:&quot;&quot;, RawPath:&quot;&quot;, ForceQuery:false, RawQuery:&quot;&quot;, Fragment:&quot;&quot;}\r\n\r\n2019/10/09 12:10:29 Forwarding to http://www.google.comapp/kibana\r\n2019/10/09 12:10:29 &amp;url.URL{Scheme:&quot;&quot;, Opaque:&quot;&quot;, User:(*url.Userinfo)(nil), Host:&quot;&quot;, Path:&quot;app/kibana&quot;, RawPath:&quot;&quot;, ForceQuery:false, RawQuery:&quot;&quot;, Fragment:&quot;&quot;}\r\nGET /app/kibana HTTP/1.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error happens when I try to handle the HTTP redirection from the kibana end.\r\n\r\nSo what is the right way to invoke the `NewSingleHostReverseProxy` without overwriting the `r.URL.Path` such that any further redirects would work with the old path (`/kibana` too)?\r\n\r\nI understand that if I pass a `Director` to the `NewSingleHostReverseProxy` I may be able to do something, but I am not sure which fields to modify in the Director.\r\n\r\nIf I were using an nginx, this is where I would be doing `proxy_pass` to pass the url correctly.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298551/single-host-reverse-proxy-handling-redirection","title":"Single host reverse proxy handling redirection"},{"tags":["sql-server-2008-r2","chocolatey"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":443,"user_id":5133523,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a675d6e9b2939603c73a4c33be712a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"learner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5133523/learner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570616787,"post_id":58298605,"comment_id":102966585,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298549/unable-to-install-sql-server-2008-r2-by-chocolatey/58298605#comment102966585_58298605"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7200269,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-PwSnoIuplEE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADI/N-dnj0VtWus/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Joshua Daniel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7200269/joshua-daniel"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570604166,"creation_date":1570604166,"answer_id":58298605,"question_id":58298549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298605","body_markdown":"Can you check the other two logs also - &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft SQL Server\\100\\Setup Bootstrap\\Log&quot; and &quot;C:\\Users\\devopsadmin\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\chocolatey\\sqlsetup.log&quot;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298549/unable-to-install-sql-server-2008-r2-by-chocolatey/58298605#58298605","title":"Unable to install SQL Server 2008 R2 by chocolatey"}],"owner":{"reputation":443,"user_id":5133523,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a675d6e9b2939603c73a4c33be712a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"learner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5133523/learner"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570604166,"creation_date":1570603951,"question_id":58298549,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298549","body_markdown":"Unable to install SQL Server 2008 R2 Management Studio by chocolatey.

Use [std::vector](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector) instead.\r\n\r\n# The last line of code is not part of any loop\r\nYou should use an IDE or simple Editor to fix intendation for you, then you would see, that the last line `x[i] = a[i][n] / a[i][i];` is not part of any loop. My tip: _always_ use parantheses after `for`!\r\n\r\n#The last loops have a wrong condition\r\nThe condition of the last loop `for(i = n-2; i=0; i--)` is `i=0`. This will_assign_ the value 0 to `i` then evaluate `i` as condition and since `i` is zero it will exit the loop. Probably you meant to use `==` to _compare_ the values.\r\n\r\nThe same thing goes for the nested loop `for (j=n-1; j = i+1; j--)`.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Variable Length Arrays\r\n&lt;br&gt;\r\n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Actually this loop will run forever for any `n != 0`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58298501/updating-variables-in-a-for-loop/58299940#58299940","title":"Updating variables in a for loop"}],"owner":{"reputation":114,"user_id":10959397,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e00f918fe4db0412c02fc55d828fcf14?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user398843","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10959397/user398843"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":60,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58299940,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570609895,"creation_date":1570603679,"question_id":58298501,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58298501","body_markdown":"I am writing an algorithm to do Gaussian elimination.
