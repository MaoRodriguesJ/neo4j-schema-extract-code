The error message is in this format:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ul class=&#39;errorlist&#39;&gt;\r\n        &lt;li&gt;Please use another email, this one is already taken.&lt;/li&gt;                       \r\n    &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n\r\n...and it does not exist until the button is pressed and the invalid form was submitted. \r\n\r\nHere is my code: \r\n\r\n**forms.py**\r\n\r\n    from django import forms\r\n    from django.contrib.auth.models import User\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    class RegistrationForm(forms.ModelForm):\r\n        email = forms.EmailField(max_length=200, help_text=&#39;Required&#39;)\r\n        password = forms.CharField(label=&#39;Password&#39;, widget=forms.PasswordInput)\r\n        password2 = forms.CharField(label=&#39;Repeat password&#39;, widget=forms.PasswordInput)\r\n    \r\n        class Meta:\r\n            model = User\r\n            fields = (&#39;username&#39;, &#39;email&#39;, &#39;first_name&#39;, &#39;last_name&#39;)\r\n    \r\n        def clean_password2(self):\r\n            cd = self.cleaned_data\r\n            if cd[&#39;password&#39;] != cd[&#39;password2&#39;]:\r\n                raise forms.ValidationError(&#39;Passwords do not match.&#39;)\r\n            return cd[&#39;password2&#39;]\r\n    \r\n        def clean_email(self):\r\n            email = self.cleaned_data[&#39;email&#39;]\r\n            if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():\r\n                raise forms.ValidationError(\r\n                    &#39;Please use another Email, that is already taken&#39;)\r\n            return email\r\n\r\n**register.html**\r\n\r\n    {% extends &#39;pages/base.html&#39; %}\r\n    \r\n    {% load static %}\r\n    \r\n    {% block cssfiles %}\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;{% static &#39;accounts/css/register.css&#39; %}&quot;&gt;\r\n    {% endblock %}\r\n    \r\n    {% block content %}\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;register-container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;above-form&quot;&gt;\r\n            Create your account.

have N worker threads, they all read from a single `queue.SimpleQueue` where the main program writes tasks to perform.

Each container uses the same ports for each process: (e.g.) localhost:8080 for frontend, localhost:3000 for backend.\r\n\r\n**How each container works:**\r\n\r\nRight now I&#39;m using docker compose to run both frontend and backend.\r\n\r\ndocker-compose.yml\r\n```yml\r\nversion: &#39;3&#39;\r\nservices:\r\n  frontend:\r\n    build: ./frontend\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 8080:80\r\n    networks:\r\n      - app-network\r\n  backend:\r\n    build: ./backend\r\n    ports:\r\n      - 3000:3000\r\n    working_dir: /usr/src/server\r\n    command: node server.bundle.js\r\n    networks:\r\n      - app-network\r\nnetworks:\r\n  app-network:\r\n    driver: bridge\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works fine. I can visit localhost:8080 for webpage and localhost:3000 for backend.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Front end container uses NGINX docker image, and backend uses NODE:10 docker image.\r\n\r\n**What I want to accomplish**\r\n\r\nOn my server I will have another instance of NGINX. I would like to somehow containerize each docker-compose setup under one port like localhost:5000.\r\n\r\nThis way when I get a request from www.example-website1.com it redirects to localhost:5000, which then loads localhost:8080 from that docker-compose setup.\r\n\r\nAgain when I get a request from www.example-website2.com it redirects to localhost:5001, which then loads localhost:8080 from another docker-compose setup. \r\n\r\n**Is this possible? Or is there another way I should be approaching this problem?**\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050492/running-multiple-docker-containers-on-a-single-linux-webserver-server","title":"Running Multiple Docker Containers on a Single Linux Webserver Server"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","spring-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1257,"user_id":2074257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e99a35470a9a54360383e801e537c4f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nghia Do","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2074257/nghia-do"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569173658,"post_id":58050491,"comment_id":102501551,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050491/how-make-call-to-daraz-api-using-java#comment102501551_58050491"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11397942,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1753401951649734/picture?type=large","display_name":"Abdul Rahman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11397942/abdul-rahman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2180,"user_id":1198979,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SdfGm.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"SSP","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1198979/ssp"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569165177,"creation_date":1569164846,"last_edit_date":1569165177,"question_id":58050491,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050491","body_markdown":"I want to make a call to an API using java, the API documentation says I should do this\r\n\r\n**//init global default client with venture URL, your email and API key**\r\n\r\n    DarazClient.init(&quot;https://api.sellercenter.daraz.pk/&quot;,&quot;test@126.com&quot;,\r\n    &quot;3aac65392ce5ebdfa7eadf4933c9316a4810581e&quot;);\r\n\r\n**//then forget all about the signing, just fire your request**\r\n\r\nHere is the address to documentation\r\n\r\nhttps://www.daraz.com/sellerapi-docs\r\n\r\nthe java documentation is available on page 28.\r\n\r\nthe thing which I want to know is how to make this call happen.\r\n\r\nas soon as some find a way to do this reply me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050491/how-make-call-to-daraz-api-using-java","title":"How make call to daraz API using java"},{"tags":["mobile","navbar","navigationbar"],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11823081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-s1DqxDjRS5c/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABhI/4KYVPQvUbPk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Arya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11823081/arya"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569164834,"creation_date":1569164834,"question_id":58050490,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050490","body_markdown":"I am trying to create a responsive website by redirecting requests from mobile devices to a mobile layout. \r\nWhat I need is a top navigation bar that includes divs for logo, account, search box and a sliding menu with animated hamburger bars.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050490/mobile-navbar-with-search-box-and-hamburger-sliding-menu","title":"mobile navbar with search box and hamburger sliding menu"},{"tags":["android","react-native","sdk","expo"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2590,"user_id":515932,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/65tzd.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jeff Gu Kang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/515932/jeff-gu-kang"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569165946,"post_id":58050486,"comment_id":102499435,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050486/how-to-resolve-uncaught-error29-0-0-in-react-native-expo-project#comment102499435_58050486"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9510,"user_id":5508175,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sXjHS.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrew","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5508175/andrew"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569167859,"creation_date":1569167859,"answer_id":58050941,"question_id":58050486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58050941","body_markdown":"The current version of the Expo app only supports SDK 33+   \r\n\r\nhttps://blog.expo.io/expo-sdk-35-is-now-available-beee0dfafbf4\r\n\r\n&gt; We routinely drop SDK versions that have low usage, but we’ve dropped more versions than usual with this release.

Read the remarks of Microsoft Docs: [`Task.Wait`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.task.wait?view=netframework-4.8#System_Threading_Tasks_Task_Wait). When used in combination with `Task.Run` chances are high for introducing a deadlock. So always avoid `Task.Wait` and use the asynchronous and awaitable versions `Task.WaitAny` and `Task.WaitAll` if you need to join multiple `Task` instances.\r\n\r\n    public partial class MainWindow

developing a mobile app. In short, it&#39;s a product catalog which should be browsable also offline. Mainly, the &quot;source of truth&quot; should be a server on the web, with each copy of the local data to be kept in-synch with the server (no need for real-time synch: an hourly refresh rate would be enough).&lt;br&gt;\r\nThe pattern I&#39;m figuring out is a react-native app integrated with a (local) RealmDB instance, that is kept in synch with a ROS running on my server(s) (According to Realm&#39;s docs, realm is quite good for such stuff).\r\n\r\nThe problem is that I&#39;m relatively new to the react-native world. While I&#39;ve been able to find plenty of docs/tutorials on how to set up a react-native app with realm, how to set up a ROS, how to persist app state with realm, whereas I don&#39;t seem to find the &quot;glue&quot;: I&#39;ve been able to find tutorials for native iOS or Android projects, but nothing on the &quot;os-agnostic&quot; side, i.e. react-native.&lt;br&gt;\r\nCould someone please explain how do I set up a realm local (mobile) instance in a React-Native environment *with full-synch* with a remote ROS (Remote Object Server)?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\n**EDIT**\r\n\r\nMay be I&#39;ll opt out from the realm solution. They are absolutely not clear about their paid/free plans. It turns out that even a self-hosted ROS is a **payed product** of realm, and I&#39;m looking for a free, open-source solution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050480/how-to-set-up-a-realm-local-mobile-instance-in-react-native-which-is-automatic","title":"how to set up a realm local (mobile) instance in react-native which is automatically synched with a ROS"},{"tags":["python","discord.py"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":783,"user_id":11148081,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uk1O5.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mikey Lockwood","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11148081/mikey-lockwood"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569165363,"post_id":58050479,"comment_id":102499271,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050479/i-am-having-error-in-python-discord-bot-code#comment102499271_58050479"},{"owner":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569167514,"post_id":58050479,"comment_id":102499876,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050479/i-am-having-error-in-python-discord-bot-code#comment102499876_58050479"},{"owner":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569167559,"post_id":58050479,"comment_id":102499888,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050479/i-am-having-error-in-python-discord-bot-code#comment102499888_58050479"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12099891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/55e71813ae76c8e53477df44e2384bcc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12099891","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12099891/user12099891"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15243,"user_id":472495,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4rtxd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"halfer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/472495/halfer"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":5,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1569165429,"answer_count":0,"score":-5,"last_activity_date":1569776184,"creation_date":1569164798,"last_edit_date":1569776184,"question_id":58050479,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050479","body_markdown":"[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nI am facing an error while uploading my code.

problem is that Tomcat is starting on the wrong port. From your logs...\r\n\r\n    2019-09-26T17:51:18.386+07:00 [APP/PROC/WEB/0] [OUT] 2019-09-26 10:51:18.386 INFO 18 --- [ main] o.s.b.w.embedded.tomcat.TomcatWebServer : Tomcat initialized with port(s): 8202 (http)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s very clearly starting on port 8202. That breaks the platform health check because the platform is asking you to start your app on port 8080. Since the app isn&#39;t listening on the requested port, the health check cannot complete successfully and Cloud Foundry must assume your app never started, so it attempts to restart the app, hoping it will work next time. Unfortunately, this is a config error so it&#39;s never going to be fixed with just a restart, so that&#39;ll loop forever.\r\n\r\nAs to why your app is starting on port 8202, it&#39;s not clear. I don&#39;t see that being set in the application.yml you specified, but it is possible that it&#39;s being set elsewhere.\r\n\r\nFor Spring Boot, you are looking for `server.port` being set. [It can be set in a number of places including application.properties, application.yml, as an env variable or system property](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21083284/1585136). That needs to be set to 8080, or better yet the `$PORT` environment variable which is set by Cloud Foundry and contains the expected port on which your app should listen. (Side note, the Java buildpack should configure this for you unless you are overriding the start command or doing something to alter it&#39;s default behavior).\r\n\r\nYou&#39;ll know it&#39;s right when Tomcat reports that it has started on port 8080 and the health check passes.\r\n\r\nHope that helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050476/failed-to-make-tcp-connection-to-port-8080-while-push-to-pivotal/58135793#58135793","title":"Failed to make TCP connection to port 8080 while push to pivotal"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11733257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de6ffcaf0fa515c9626eccb257b8c8bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erlangga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11733257/erlangga"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11733257,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de6ffcaf0fa515c9626eccb257b8c8bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Erlangga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11733257/erlangga"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58135793,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569591789,"creation_date":1569164765,"last_edit_date":1569499451,"question_id":58050476,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050476","body_markdown":"I&#39;m new in pivotal cloud foundry.

each member of the apply family by default either returns:\r\n\r\n- a simplified object (vector, matrix, array) where all elements are the same atomic type such as logical, integer, double, complex, raw;\r\n- a non-simplified object (data frame, list) where each element are not necessarily the same type and can include complex, class objects.\r\n\r\nTo adequately translate your `for` loop into an apply-family function you must first ask what is the input type and desired output type?

The professor said that I could use Go.  I asked him if I could use the latest version, 1.13, rather than the version installed on the server, 1.10, to leverage the module management feature and the updated errors module.  He did *not* say that I was restricted to 1.10 and even gave me the contact information of the server admin.  I reached out to the server admin with my professor CC&#39;d and he said he doesn&#39;t want to update the server&#39;s version of Go in the middle of the semester.  He then included instructions on how to download, install, and use whatever version of Go that I need in my home directory.\r\n\r\n&gt; Pick your version:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; https://golang.org/dl/\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Set it up for your own use:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; https://golang.org/doc/install\r\n\r\nI installed go 1.13 and updated my own envvars to reflect this version and everything works.\r\n\r\nWell, the other requirement is that I have to hand my professor my project and that it has to compile on the server.  I am thinking that if I hand him a bundle and give him directions on how to build it, then I&#39;ve technically met the requirements of the project so far.\r\n\r\nMy question is, does Go have anything that takes my Go v1.13 environment and packages everything up so that the project can ***compile*** on the target server?  I have only been able to find solutions along the lines of &quot;*just copy the project binary to your production server*&quot; but that doesn&#39;t help me.  I need it to *compile* on the production server.  Besides, I tried copying my binary to the production server and it couldn&#39;t find my html templates (stored in ./ui/html/ directory) but I guess that will be solved in this discussion or saved for another SO question later.\r\n\r\n    student@universityserver:~$ ./web\r\n    INFO\t2019/09/22 10:21:52 Starting server on :5089\r\n    INFO\t2019/09/22 10:23:03 &lt;ipaddress&gt;:63527 - HTTP/1.1 GET /\r\n    ERROR\t2019/09/22 10:23:03 handlers.go:29: open ./ui/html/home.page.tmpl: no such file or directory\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of right now is to basically add everything they need (the go amd64 binary distribution and all modules) and write a script that handles it all (extract go in local folder, export envvars, build, etc.)\r\n\r\n&gt; Dear, Professor.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Copy this tarball to your home directory, extract, run `build_my_goapp.sh` script.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Sincerely,\r\n&gt; Your student","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050459/how-to-create-an-all-inclusive-go-environment-to-meet-the-requirements-set-forth","title":"How to create an all-inclusive Go environment to meet the requirements set forth: &quot;application must compile on shared server&quot;"},{"tags":["mysql","sql","select","union"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569164746,"post_id":58050456,"comment_id":102499106,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050456/build-table-from-select-union#comment102499106_58050456"},{"owner":{"reputation":27260,"user_id":5389997,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4d227900a17ca5c34bad6d2b27122c7f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shadow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5389997/shadow"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569164756,"post_id":58050456,"comment_id":102499108,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050456/build-table-from-select-union#comment102499108_58050456"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":870966,"user_id":1144035,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e514b017977ebf742a418cac697d8996?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gordon Linoff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1144035/gordon-linoff"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569169102,"creation_date":1569169102,"answer_id":58051111,"question_id":58050456,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58051111","body_markdown":"Your method is fine.

I want to be able to add a red border a particular field if it fails validation.  \r\n\r\nTo do that, I have set up a conditional for the `error` prop.  IF it is touched AND IF the error is passed, then it renders that prop with a value of &#39;error&#39;.\r\n\r\nNow there are a few problems with this.\r\n\r\nFIRST PROBLEM\r\nI don&#39;t need to render a value of &#39;error&#39; (or any other value) to the `error` attribute.  I just need to have the attribute &#39;error&#39; itself (without any value) and then it will be styled appropriately. \r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND PROBLEM\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s a bit annoying to write out the same conditional test for each field.  I would like to know if there is something like the `ErrorMessage` component, except for a prop.  Basically, something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&lt;Email name=&quot;email&quot; errorProp /&gt;\r\n&lt;Password name=&quot;password&quot; errorProp /&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe idea being that `errorProp` will set an attribute of &#39;error&#39; if an error exists and nothing if an error does not exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo here is my question...\r\n\r\nHow can I create my own `errorProp` or, at the very least, simplify what I am trying to do?\r\n\r\nThanks.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050433/conditionally-checking-for-errors-with-formik-field-component","title":"Conditionally Checking for Errors with Formik Field Component"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12103058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x92dp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"secretLion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103058/secretlion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569261531,"post_id":58050562,"comment_id":102531497,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050429/i-was-learning-matplotlib-and-i-came-across-ax-get-xticklabels-ax-get-ytick/58050562#comment102531497_58050562"},{"owner":{"reputation":2731,"user_id":3063243,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88a5195a59ff5fd55255f185f518fdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"phi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3063243/phi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12103058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x92dp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"secretLion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103058/secretlion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569263090,"post_id":58050562,"comment_id":102532119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050429/i-was-learning-matplotlib-and-i-came-across-ax-get-xticklabels-ax-get-ytick/58050562#comment102532119_58050562"},{"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12103058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/x92dp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"secretLion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103058/secretlion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569352799,"post_id":58050562,"comment_id":102567454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050429/i-was-learning-matplotlib-and-i-came-across-ax-get-xticklabels-ax-get-ytick/58050562#comment102567454_58050562"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2731,"user_id":3063243,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88a5195a59ff5fd55255f185f518fdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"phi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3063243/phi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2731,"user_id":3063243,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a88a5195a59ff5fd55255f185f518fdc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"phi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3063243/phi"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569166499,"last_edit_date":1569166499,"creation_date":1569165271,"answer_id":58050562,"question_id":58050429,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58050562","body_markdown":"`ax.get_xticklabels()` and `ax.get_yticklabels()` both return list-like objects.

A typical SQL database has the same limitation but it has some intelligent strategies ( query plan ) that tries to find out the which field to use for index lookup and which ones to use for manually filtering the result. Dexie does not have query plans so you need to do that logic yourself.\r\n\r\nFor cases where you are combining an equals filter with another filter, a compound index can be used also to get more efficient AND queries.\r\n\r\nSo as an example we can take your exact example and translate it into the most optimal way using dexie queries:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nconst db = new Dexie(&quot;multipleCriteriasSample&quot;);\r\ndb.version(1).stores({\r\n  someTable: &#39;id, [field1+field3]&#39;\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunction doTheQuery() {\r\n  return db.someTable.where(&#39;[field1+field3]&#39;).anyOf([\r\n    [0, 1],\r\n    [0, 2],\r\n    [0, 3],\r\n    [0, 4]\r\n  ]).and(item =&gt; item.field2 !== &quot;test&quot;);\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThe logic for the above is this:\r\n\r\nfield1 is an equals operator - which makes it possible to combine with another criteria if we have it in a compound index (&#39;[field1+field3]&#39;)\r\nfield2 is a notEqual which generally never has any gain of using an index - so filter it using the and() method.\r\nfield3 is an anyOf().

in python are immutable. When you do:\r\n\r\n    a = b = 4\r\n    a = a + 1\r\n\r\n`a` and `b` are independent in this case, because as soon as you try to mutate `a`, you are actually binding a new `int` object to `a`. You&#39;re never actually changing integers, just rebinding.\r\n\r\nWhen you do:\r\n\r\n    head = curr = ListNode(0)\r\n\r\nYou create one `ListNode` object, and bind the references `head` and `curr` to it. They&#39;re both pointing to the same place in memory, just like the integers. However, since your class is mutable, there is no reason to rebind when a mutation occurs.

This uses the official [Spring boot starter from IBM MQ][2] which will kindly create a connection factory and will autoconfigure it with some defaults from application.properties:\r\n\r\n    ibm.mq.queueManager=myQMName\r\n    ibm.mq.channel=myChannel\r\n    ibm.mq.connName=myhostname(myPort)\r\n    ibm.mq.user=username\r\n    ibm.mq.password=*******\r\n    ibm.mq.userAuthenticationMQCSP=false\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, back to the Spring Integration case. According to the [int-jms:inbound-gateway spec][3], a connectionFactory will be injected to the gateway, by name (attribute: connection-factory) which is set up to be &quot;jmsConnectionFactory&quot; by default\r\n\r\n&gt; \tBy default, all of the JMS adapters that require a reference to the\r\n&gt; ConnectionFactory automatically look for a bean named\r\n&gt; jmsConnectionFactory. That is why you do not see a connection-factory\r\n&gt; attribute in many of the examples. However, if your JMS\r\n&gt; ConnectionFactory has a different bean name, you need to provide that\r\n&gt; attribute.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t see any way to set up a predictable name for the connection factory that I can plug into the int-jms:inbound-gateway.\r\n\r\nNow, taking a different approach, as per [this example][4] I&#39;ve created my connectionFactory with an adecuate name:\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;jmsConnectionFactory&quot; class=&quot;com.ibm.mq.jms.MQQueueConnectionFactory&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;property name=&quot;transportType&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;\r\n         &lt;property name=&quot;queueManager&quot; value=&quot;myQMName&quot;/&gt;\r\n         &lt;property name=&quot;hostName&quot; value=&quot;myhostname&quot;/&gt;\r\n         &lt;property name=&quot;port&quot; value=&quot;myPort&quot; /&gt;\r\n         &lt;property name=&quot;channel&quot; value=&quot;myChannel&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\nBut now I need somewhere to put the credentials and the security parameters. Looking at the example above, it looks like I need to plug something like:\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;secureJmsConnectionAdapter&quot; class=&quot;**yourpackages.SecureJMSConnectionAdapter**&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;targetConnectionFactory&quot; ref=&quot;${jms.mq.connection.factory}&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;userName&quot; value=&quot;${jms.username}&quot;/&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;pwdAlias&quot; value=&quot;${jms.alias}&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever it is unclear to me how to implement this SecureJMSConnectionAdapter.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if I set up my own connection factory, I will lose all of MQ boot starter automagic thanks to this annotation on the [MQAutoConfiguration class][5]:\r\n\r\n    @ConditionalOnMissingBean(value=javax.jms.ConnectionFactory.class)\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how to put these pieces together?\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: Just to avoid any possible red herrings to anyone, the MQRC2009 was irrelevant to ibm.mq.userAuthenticationMQCSP=false. \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/mq-jms-application-development-with-spring-boot/\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-jms-spring/blob/master/mq-jms-spring-boot-starter\r\n  [3]: https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/docs/5.2.0.M3/reference/html/jms.html\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32299757/spring-integration-with-ibm-mq-series/58032981#58032981\r\n  [5]: https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-jms-spring/blob/master/mq-jms-spring-boot-starter/src/main/java/com/ibm/mq/spring/boot/MQAutoConfiguration.java","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050392/ibm-mq-and-spring-integration-security-settings","title":"IBM MQ and Spring Integration -

would like to use Matomo (self-hosted tracking software, similar to Google Analytics). The JS snippet exposes a PHP file which is called for tracking (see [here][1] for example). This PHP file is in the same folder as the file for login and others, i.e. this exposes too much information for malicious crawlers. Therefore I would like to proxy the URL to the PHP file via an non-existing or misleading path. E.g.\r\n\r\nUnsecure:\r\n```\r\n_paq.push([&#39;setTrackerUrl&#39;, u+&#39;https://www.mytracker.com/exposed_installation/matomo.php&#39;]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould become something more secure:\r\n```\r\n_paq.push([&#39;setTrackerUrl&#39;, u+&#39;https://www.mytracker.com/non-existing-path/matomo.php&#39;]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo this way a crawler could only see the tracking script file, but everything else would lead to a 404.\r\n\r\nWould that be possible?

I can also see myself representing the curve from one unit to another (radians).\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/m5uuE.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050384/best-data-structure-packages-to-represent-geometric-units-on-a-grid","title":"Best data structure &amp; packages to represent geometric units on a grid"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core","html5-video"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":170,"user_id":284541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb2c962e383ebd6c1ca2fd561664d2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Trevor Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284541/trevor-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569468461,"post_id":58100647,"comment_id":102608365,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050382/c-core-html5-video-wont-load-in-chrome-with-range-tags/58100647#comment102608365_58100647"},{"owner":{"reputation":170,"user_id":284541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb2c962e383ebd6c1ca2fd561664d2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Trevor Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284541/trevor-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569468642,"post_id":58100647,"comment_id":102608396,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050382/c-core-html5-video-wont-load-in-chrome-with-range-tags/58100647#comment102608396_58100647"},{"owner":{"reputation":8835,"user_id":1458617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0790c4e75c14c45344fef4937aac2e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rudolfs Bundulis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1458617/rudolfs-bundulis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":170,"user_id":284541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb2c962e383ebd6c1ca2fd561664d2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Trevor Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284541/trevor-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569472841,"post_id":58100647,"comment_id":102609237,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050382/c-core-html5-video-wont-load-in-chrome-with-range-tags/58100647#comment102609237_58100647"},{"owner":{"reputation":170,"user_id":284541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb2c962e383ebd6c1ca2fd561664d2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Trevor Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284541/trevor-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569514639,"post_id":58100647,"comment_id":102630459,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050382/c-core-html5-video-wont-load-in-chrome-with-range-tags/58100647#comment102630459_58100647"},{"owner":{"reputation":8835,"user_id":1458617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0790c4e75c14c45344fef4937aac2e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rudolfs Bundulis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1458617/rudolfs-bundulis"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":170,"user_id":284541,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2cb2c962e383ebd6c1ca2fd561664d2f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Trevor Watson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/284541/trevor-watson"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569516646,"post_id":58100647,"comment_id":102631440,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050382/c-core-html5-video-wont-load-in-chrome-with-range-tags/58100647#comment102631440_58100647"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8835,"user_id":1458617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0790c4e75c14c45344fef4937aac2e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rudolfs Bundulis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1458617/rudolfs-bundulis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8835,"user_id":1458617,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0790c4e75c14c45344fef4937aac2e8a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rudolfs Bundulis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1458617/rudolfs-bundulis"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569474188,"last_edit_date":1569474188,"creation_date":1569421426,"answer_id":58100647,"question_id":58050382,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58100647","body_markdown":"There are several problems with your implementation (and please post full code, with these snippets it is not possible to understand what is `s` when you are using `s.Item2`):\r\n\r\n 1. `fs.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);` - either this is a typo or you haven&#39;t understood how the range header works.

Tried `http:\\/\\/localhost:5001\\/`, `http:////localhost:5001` and some similar variants, ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050366/replace-relative-css-urls-to-absolute-in-gulp-for-asp-net-core-app","title":"Replace relative CSS urls to absolute in gulp for ASP.NET Core app"},{"tags":["networking","wifi","router","ping","internet-connection"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3347,"user_id":9926383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T2QgN.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kalehmann","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9926383/kalehmann"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569164536,"post_id":58050364,"comment_id":102499065,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050364/cant-connect-to-wifi-internet-network-if-other-device-is-connected-to-router#comment102499065_58050364"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12103054,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54b6d0a193602fd4affad53d8ee3aa52?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sebs-stuff","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12103054/sebs-stuff"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569164020,"creation_date":1569164020,"question_id":58050364,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050364","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having an unusual network issue.\r\nMy laptop (Macbook Air 13&quot;, 2016) works fine on any network it connects on, except for one (My home router).\r\n\r\nIndeed, my laptop actually can connect to the internet, only when one specific laptop is disconnected to that router.

I understand the input data has the following structure:\r\n```\r\n[&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;, &#39;D&#39;]\r\n[&#39;DEV&#39;, &#39;J&#39;, &#39;BBBB&#39;,

\r\nAs a first step you have to make this text data csv-readable by converting it to text that just contain lines with the values separated by comma&#39;s like:\r\n```\r\nA, B, C, D\r\nDEV, J, BBBB, 2019-08-28\r\n5R, J, EMAIL, 2019-05-21\r\n```\r\nThen as `csv.reader` reads an IO object (similar to a file) rather than just a text string you need to use `io.StringIO` to change the text to an IO object.

In this case you are covering all the area and even more but there is no *more*.\r\n\r\nFrom [the specification][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt;Each column or row’s share of the leftover space can be computed as the column or row’s `&lt;flex&gt; * &lt;leftover space&gt; / &lt;sum of all flex factors&gt;`.\r\n\r\n&gt;Note: If the sum of the flex factors **is less than 1**, they’ll take up only a **corresponding fraction of the leftover space**, rather than expanding to fill the entire thing. This is similar to how Flexbox [CSS-FLEXBOX-1] acts when the sum of the flex values is less than 1.\r\n\r\nIf we have a sum less than 1 then each item will take the correspending space. In the first case it&#39;s `0.14fr` (`0.14* Height`) and when the sum is bigger than 1 we apply the formula and in this case whataver the value you will be using in `repeat(7,x)` you will have:\r\n\r\n    (x/7*x) * Height = Height/7\r\n\r\nBasically, you simply divide by 7.\r\n\r\nIn your case you have two ranges: from `0` to `1/7 = 0.1428..` where you will have missing space.

My primary browser is Firefox, but I&#39;ve tried replicating this in Chrome too.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. Since the browser calculates the widths of the *fr* on-the-go, there might be a chance that this might be reproducible only on my\r\n&gt; machine. (I think? Not sure.)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 3. This might be a fringe case, I agree. Why define *fr* units using smaller numbers like below when I can just use numbers bigger than\r\n&gt; *0.15*, or *1*, really? I only came across this problem (quirk?) when I just typed in the fractional values of a layout; I worked out the\r\n&gt; *fr* values by dividing the pixel lengths of the child elements by the pixel length of the parent container, which obviously works out to be lesser than 1.\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 4. I used CSS rather than SASS in the pen, since I thought maybe the SASS pre-processor might be doing something weird behind the scenes (far-fetched, I know, but I didn&#39;t want to take the chance.)\r\n&gt;\r\n&gt; 5.

For example, `[String]` is a List of the type `String`. Even though the `[String]` type *wraps* `String`, in GraphQL it is considered a *separate*, *distinct* type from `String`. In other words, you can&#39;t use `[String]` where `String` is expected and you can&#39;t use `String` where `[String]` is expected.\r\n\r\nAn argument (like `handle`) or input object field (like `eq`) only has a single GraphQL type. If a variable is used as the value of an argument, its type must match that argument&#39;s type. It appears `eq` has the type `String!` (a non-null String), so you can only pass it a single `String`, not a List.\r\n\r\nWhether a way exists to query based on an array of values is up to the server implementation. Some schemas support a way to do that (for example, instead of `eq`, there may be an `in` field that accepts a List). However, this is schema-specific. Review the document for the server/framework/library you&#39;re using, or explore the schema using an available GraphiQL or GraphQL Playground interface.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050329/how-to-use-an-array-inside-a-graphql-query-variable/58051017#58051017","title":"How to use an array inside a GraphQL Query Variable"}],"owner":{"reputation":544,"user_id":945423,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e9d3636319fe8968438596512916cab0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Farreal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/945423/farreal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58051017,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569168409,"creation_date":1569163815,"question_id":58050329,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58050329","body_markdown":"I&#39;d like to use an array inside a GraphQL query variable so that I can get the data of more than one product from a single query with Gatsby however at the moment I get errors.\r\n\r\nMy graphQL query looks like:\r\n\r\n    query ($id: [String!]) {\r\n      shopifyProduct(handle: {eq: $id}) {\r\n        handle\r\n        id\r\n        title\r\n        handle\r\n        productType\r\n        shopifyId\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand my Query Variable looks like:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;id&quot;: [&quot;liner-jacket&quot;, &quot;pocket-t-shirt&quot;]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe desired response would be (something like):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &quot;data&quot;: {\r\n        &quot;shopifyProduct&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;handle&quot;: &quot;liner-jacket&quot;,\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Shopify__Product__hopbjidjoqjndadnawdawda123123=&quot;,\r\n          &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Liner Jacket&quot;,\r\n          &quot;productType&quot;: &quot;jacket&quot;,\r\n          &quot;shopifyId&quot;: &quot;hopbjidjoqjndadnawdawda123123=&quot;\r\n        },\r\n        &quot;shopifyProduct&quot;: {\r\n          &quot;handle&quot;: &quot;pocket-t-shirt&quot;,\r\n          &quot;id&quot;: &quot;Shopify__Product__iajwdoiajdoadjwaowda4023123=&quot;,\r\n          &quot;title&quot;: &quot;Pocket T-Shirt&quot;,\r\n          &quot;productType&quot;: &quot;t-shirt&quot;,\r\n          &quot;shopifyId&quot;: &quot;iajwdoiajdoadjwaowda4023123=&quot;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050329/how-to-use-an-array-inside-a-graphql-query-variable","title":"How to use an array inside a GraphQL Query Variable"},{"tags":["python","django","pip","virtualenv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569169409,"post_id":58050328,"comment_id":102500332,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050328/issue-with-installing-virtualenv-for-django#comment102500332_58050328"},{"owner":{"reputation":32047,"user_id":7976758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/512cfbaf98d63ca4acd57b2df792aec6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"phd","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7976758/phd"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569169421,"post_id":58050328,"comment_id":102500337,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58050328/issue-with-installing-virtualenv-for-django#comment102500337_58050328"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11106747,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-mhSf7xdrF4g/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcpC6MjY_-dv5ZjP9yyFRXJrYFsDw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Adithya Kunigiri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11106747/adithya-kunigiri"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569165361,"creation_date":1569165361,"answer_id":58050571,"question_id":58050328,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58050571","body_markdown":"Instead of using virtualenv try using the built in python `venv`.
