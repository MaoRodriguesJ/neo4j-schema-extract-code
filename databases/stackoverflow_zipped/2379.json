: I&#39;m trying to execute dynamically some code from another snippet. But I am stuck with handling memory reference (e.g. `mov 40200b,  %rdi`): can I patch my code or the snippet running code so that `0x40200b` is resolved correctly (as the offset `200b` from the code)?\r\n___\r\n\r\nTo generate the code to be executed dynamically I start from a (kernel) object and I resolve the references using ld.\r\n \r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/python\r\nimport os, subprocess\r\nif os.geteuid() != 0:\r\n    print(&#39;Run this as root&#39;)\r\n    exit(-1)\r\nwith open(&quot;/proc/kallsyms&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) as f:\r\n    out=f.read()\r\nsym= subprocess.Popen( [&#39;nm&#39;, &#39;ebbchar.ko&#39;, &#39;-u&#39; ,&#39;--demangle&#39;, &#39;-fposix&#39;],stdout=subprocess.PIPE) \r\nv=&#39;&#39;\r\nfor sym in sym.stdout:\r\n    s = &quot; &quot;+ sym.split()[0]+ &quot;\\n&quot;\r\n    off = out.find(s)\r\n    v += &quot;--defsym &quot;+s.strip() + &quot;=0x&quot; +out[off-18:off -2]+&quot; &quot;\r\nprint(v)\r\nos.system(&quot;ld ebbchar.ko &quot;+ v +&quot;-o ebbchar.bin&quot;);\r\n```\r\nI then transmit the code to be executed with through a mmaped file\r\n\r\n```c\r\nint fd = open(argv[1], O_RDWR | O_SYNC);\r\naddress1 = mmap(NULL, page_size, PROT_WRITE|PROT_READ , MAP_SHARED, fd, 0);\r\nint in=open(argv[2],O_RDONLY);\r\nsz= read(in, buf+8,BUFFER_SIZE-8);\r\nuint64_t entrypoint=atol(argv[3]);\r\n*((uint64_t*)buf)=entrypoint;\r\nwrite(fd, buf, min(sz+8, (size_t) BUFFER_SIZE));\r\n```\r\n\r\nI execute code dynamycally with this code\r\n```c\r\nstruct mmap_info *info;\r\ncopy_from_user((void*)(&amp;info-&gt;offset),buf,8);\r\ncopy_from_user(info-&gt;data, buf+8, sz-8);\r\nunsigned long (*func)(void)  func= (void*) (info-&gt;data + info-&gt;offset);\r\nint ret= func();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis approch work for code that don&#39;t access memory such as `&quot;\\x55\\x48\\x89\\xe5\\xc7\\x45\\xf8\\x02\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xc7\\x45\\xfc\\x03\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x8b\\x55\\xf8\\x8b\\x45\\xfc\\x01\\xd0\\x5d\\xc3&quot;` but I have problems when memory is involved. \r\n\r\nSee example below.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume i wan&#39;t execute dynamically the function vm_close. `Objdump -d -S` returns:\r\n```asm\r\n0000000000401017 &lt;vm_close&gt;:\r\n{\r\n  401017:\te8 e4 07 40 81       \tcallq  ffffffff81801800 &lt;__fentry__&gt;\r\n    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;vm_close&quot;);\r\n  40101c:\t48 c7 c7 0b 20 40 00 \tmov    $0x40200b,%rdi\r\n  401023:\te9 b6 63 ce 80       \tjmpq   ffffffff810e73de &lt;printk&gt;\r\n```\r\nAt execution, my function pointer points to the right code:\r\n```\r\n(gdb) x/12x $rip\r\n0xffffc90000c0601c:     0x48    0xc7    0xc7    0x0b    0x20    0x40    0x00    0xe9\r\n0xffffc90000c06024:     0xb6    0x63    0xce    0x80\r\n(gdb) x/2i $rip\r\n=&gt; 0xffffc90000c0601c:  mov    $0x40200b,%rdi\r\n   0xffffc90000c06023:  jmpq   0xffffc8ff818ec3de\r\n```\r\n__BUT__, this code will fail since:\r\n\r\n1) In my context $0x40200b points at the physical address `$0x40200b`, and not `offset 200b` from the beginning of the code.\r\n\r\n2) I don&#39;t understand why but the address displayed there is actually different from the correct one (0xffffc8ff818ec3de != ffffffff810e73de) so it won&#39;t point on my symbol and will crash.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to solve my 2 issues?\r\n\r\nAlso, I had trouble to find good documentation related to my issue (low-level memory resolution), if you could give me some, that would really help me.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\n&lt;s&gt;Edit: Since I run the code in the kernel I cannot simply compile the code with `-fPIC` or `-fpie` which is not allowed by gcc (`cc1: error: code model kernel does not support PIC mode`)&lt;/s&gt;\r\n\r\n**Edit 24/09:**\r\nAccording to @Peter Cordes comment, I recompiled it adding `mcmodel=small -fpie -mno-red-zone -mnosse` to the Makefile (`/lib/modules/$(uname -r)fixed/build/Makefile`)\r\nThis is better than in the original version since the generated code before linking is now:\r\n```asm\r\n0000000000000018 &lt;vm_close&gt;:\r\n{\r\n  18:\tff 15 00 00 00 00    \tcallq  *0x0(%rip)        # 1e &lt;vm_close+0x6&gt;\r\n    printk(KERN_INFO &quot;vm_close&quot;);\r\n  1e:\t48 8d 3d 00 00 00 00 \tlea    0x0(%rip),%rdi        # 25 &lt;vm_close+0xd&gt;\r\n  25:\te8 00 00 00 00       \tcallq  2a &lt;vm_close+0x12&gt;\r\n}\r\n  2a:\tc3                   \tretq   So thanks to rip-relative addressing \r\n````\r\nThus I’m now able to access the other variables on my script…\r\n\r\nThus, after linking I can successfully access my variable embedded within the buffer.\r\n\r\n```asm\r\n40101e:\t48 8d 3d e6 0f 00 00 \tlea    0xfe6(%rip),%rdi        # 40200b\r\n```\r\n\r\nStill, one problem remains:\r\n\r\nThe symbol I want to access (`printk`) and my executable buffer are in different address spaces, for exemple:\r\n```\r\nprintk=0xffffffff810e73de:\r\nExecutable_buffer=0xffffc9000099d000\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut in my `callq` to `printk`, I have only 32 bits to write the address to call as an offset from `$rip` since there is no `.got` section in the kernel. This means that printk *has* to be located within `[$rip-2GO, $rip+2GO]`. But this is not the case there.\r\n\r\nDo I have a way to access the printk address although they are located more than 2GO away from my buffer (I tried to used `mcmodel=medium` but I haven&#39;t seen any difference in the generated code), for instance by modifying gcc options so that the binary actually have a `.got` section?\r\n\r\nOr is there a reliable way to force my *executable* and *potentially-too large-for-kmalloc* buffer to be allocated in the `[0xffffffff00000000 ; 0xffffffffffffffff] range?` (I currently use `__vmalloc(BUFFER_SIZE, GFP_KERNEL, PAGE_KERNEL_EXEC);` )\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Edit 27/09:**\r\nI succedded in allocationg my buffer in the `[0xffffffff00000000 ; 0xffffffffffffffff]` range using the *non exported* `__vmalloc_node_range` function as a (dirty) hack.\r\n\r\n```c\r\nIMPORTED(__vmalloc_node_range)(BUFFER_SIZE, MODULE_ALIGN,\r\n\t\t\t\tMODULES_VADDR + get_module_load_offset(),\r\n\t\t\t\tMODULES_END, GFP_KERNEL,\r\n\t\t\t\tPAGE_KERNEL_EXEC, 0, NUMA_NO_NODE,\r\n\t\t\t\t__builtin_return_address(0));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, when I know the address of my executable buffer and the address of the kernel symbols (by parsing `/proc/kallsyms`), I can patch my binary using `ld`’s option `--defsym symbol=relative_address` where `relative_address = symbol_address - buffer_offset` .\r\n\r\nDespite being extremely dirt, this approach actually works.\r\n\r\nBut I need to relink my binary each time I execute it since the buffer may (and will) be allocated at a different address. To solve this issue, I think the best way would be to build my executable as a **real** position independent executable so that I can just patch the global offset table and not fully relink the module.\r\n\r\nBut with the options provided there I got a rip-relative address but no got/plt. So I&#39;d like to find a way to build my module as a proper PIE.\r\n\r\nThis post is getting huge, messy and we are deviating from the original question. Thus, I opened a new simplified post [there][1]. If I get interesting answers, I&#39;ll edit this post to explain them.\r\n\r\n___\r\nNote: For the sake of simplicity, safety tests are not displayed there\r\n\r\nNote 2: I am perfectly aware that my PoC is very unusual and can be a bad practice but I&#39;d like to do it anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58131500/compile-a-kernel-module-as-a-position-independant-executable","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971842/dynamic-c-code-execution-memory-references","title":"Dynamic C code execution: memory references"},{"tags":["c#","ssl","tls1.2","tls1.1"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25258,"user_id":448932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QgLLl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"500 - Internal Server Error","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/448932/500-internal-server-error"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568714599,"post_id":57971841,"comment_id":102353807,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971841/how-to-find-the-tls-version-is-being-used-when-api-calling#comment102353807_57971841"},{"owner":{"reputation":5126,"user_id":3936696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3hbNl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rahul Nikate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3936696/rahul-nikate"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568715641,"post_id":57971841,"comment_id":102354328,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971841/how-to-find-the-tls-version-is-being-used-when-api-calling#comment102354328_57971841"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11124030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bf82e8c90fedfb76c490707a60e13f83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Vinod","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11124030/vinod"},"last_editor":{"reputation":398,"user_id":5061176,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-YmTSK2EsCNo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAESE/pg2-gJJ3L9U/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mahesh Waghmare","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5061176/mahesh-waghmare"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568716918,"creation_date":1568714389,"last_edit_date":1568716918,"question_id":57971841,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971841","body_markdown":"How to find the TLS version when an API call in C# (RestClient and WebRequest)?\r\nHow to change the TLS version?

basically have two choices. \r\n\r\nOne is to return the rows as part of a SELECT statement as suggested. However, if you want to consume those in the next bit of T-SQL, you can&#39;t just SELECT from a table returned by a stored procedure. \r\n\r\nLots of people ask for a command like SELECT * FROM (EXEC someproc) but that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nWhat you can do instead is to define a table variable like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDECLARE @OutputIDs TABLE\r\n(\r\n    OutputIDKey int IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    OutputID int\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can use an INSERT EXEC to get the values:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT @OutputIDs (OutputID)\r\nEXEC dbo.MyStoredProcedure;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then you have the IDs in the table variable to do what you want with. (Note: you could also do that with a temporary table but it isn&#39;t as good an option)\r\n\r\nThe other option is to use an OUTPUT parameter to the stored procedure. However, you&#39;d need to pack all your IDs into a string (perhaps a comma-delimited list) before you return it. You then use a function to unpack the string back to a set of IDs. (If you&#39;re on SQL Server 2016 or later, you could use the STRING_SPLIT function).\r\n\r\nThe trick with using OUTPUT parameters is that you have to define it as OUTPUT when you are calling the procedure, and in the header of the procedure itself. Here&#39;s the skeleton code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE PROCEDURE dbo.DoSomething\r\n@OtherParameter int,\r\n@IDsToOutput nvarchar(max) OUTPUT,\r\n@YetAnotherParameter int\r\nAS\r\nBEGIN\r\n...\r\nEND;\r\n```\r\nAnd then when you call the procedure, you do this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nDECLARE @OutputIDs nvarchar(max);\r\n\r\nEXEC dbo.DoSomething @OtherParameter = 1, \r\n                     @IDsToOutput = @OutputIDs OUTPUT,\r\n                     @YetAnotherParameter = 2;\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM STRING_SPLIT(@OutputIDs, &#39;,&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHope that helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971795/stored-procedure-to-delete-some-entries-and-return-their-ids/57972312#57972312","title":"Stored procedure to delete some entries and return their IDs"}],"owner":{"reputation":387,"user_id":10406502,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8127fd3ae9b27b6badff76c416df79c3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andr&#233; Reichelt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10406502/andr%c3%a9-reichelt"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57972196,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568718485,"creation_date":1568714214,"last_edit_date":1568718485,"question_id":57971795,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971795","body_markdown":"I want to create a stored procedure or database function to delete some entries and return their IDs to the client.

Therefore, I provide a guide below that I recently (today) used in order to accomplish this on a fresh install on a new computer. For this I decided to use `PyCharm Community Edition 2018.3` and `Anaconda3 version 2019.07.` I performed this on `Windows 10 Enterprise version 1903`. I have also performed this procedure on Windows 7 Home Premium edition (some time ago). \r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n**This will enable you to use PyCharm and Anaconda together, so that you can:**\r\n\r\n - Know the prerequisite steps leading up to creating a conda environment, and become familiar with the steps following this action with using Anaconda with PyCharm. \r\n - Use the `Terminal` window in PyCharm with packages that are installed with Anaconda&#39;s version of Python. You can then use both regular python and conda commands to view, update or install packages. For instance, depending on your preference, you could use &#39;pip list&#39; (python command) or &#39;conda list&#39; to list installed packages. \r\n - Use the Anaconda python interpreter as the default `Python Console` in PyCharm\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\n**To accomplish this, please follow these steps:**\r\n\r\n 1. Install `PyCharm`, and import any settings file you may have from previous PyCharm installation on other computer (optional). Assuming you are starting fresh, create a new project and set the (default) project folder location.\r\n 2. Install `Anaconda`. My install location was set to `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3`. Note that &#39;ProgramData&#39; folder is hidden by default. You should enable viewing of hidden folders in windows explorer, if you need to manually browse for it. Upon installation, I decided to have the options `Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable` and `Register Anaconda as my default Python 3.7` set as deselected. \r\n 3. Open `Windows Explorer` and paste in `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3` (or your install directory) in the address bar. This should take you to that directory. Navigate to the environments folder named `envs`. Select the address bar and copy that address. I got `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\envs`. You will need this later. \r\n 4. Open program named `Anaconda Navigator (Anaconda3)`. You should see this from the list of newly installed programs. Alternatively, search for it and open it. This will initialize some stuff (unknown to me) that I have found necessary to be able to complete this guide. For the next steps we dont need this program running. You could close it if you want.\r\n 5. Decide on a name for the (ana)conda environment that we will create. I used `py37` for simplicity. You only need to do this once for the python projects you will make. It is possible to make more environments if you should need that for some python projects in the future.\r\n 6. Open program named `Anaconda Prompt (Anaconda3)`, preferentially as administrator. Opening as administrator may prevent complications that could occur on some systems. To do so, search for the program and then right-click it, and choose `Run as administrator`.\r\n 7. Enter this command: `conda create -n py37 python=3.7 anaconda`. It should prompt you to install some packages. Enter `y` to accept and proceed with the setup. This step may take some time to finish. Once finished, it may show you the needed command to activate the environment. Don&#39;t activate it just yet, ie. ignore that message for now.\r\n 8. Assuming environment path `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3\\envs` and environment name `py37`, run the following command (alter as needed to match your environment path and name): &lt;br/&gt;`set PATH=C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda\\envs\\py37\\Scripts;C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda\\envs\\py37;%PATH%`\r\n 9. Run this command: `conda activate py37`. This will activate your environment.\r\n 10. Navigate to a folder you can easily access, such as the `Documents` folder on your machine. To do so, execute this command: `cd &quot;C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents&quot;`. \r\n 11. Execute the following command: `echo %PATH% &gt; path_value.txt`. This will export &quot;PATH&quot; values to a text file that can be found in the Documents folder as `path_value.txt`. Open this file and copy the content within. This will be needed in the following steps with setting up PyCharm for use with the Anaconda environment. \r\n 12. In PyCharm, navigate to `Settings - Tools - Terminal`. Check that `Start directory` field contains the path of your project folder, ie. such as `C:/Users/YourUsername/Documents/YourProjectFolderName`. Then, select the folder icon for the `Environment variables` field. Click the plus symbol, and add a new entry with `PATH` and your path value (as found from the `path_value.txt` file) in the `Name` and `Value` fields, respectively. \r\n 13. In PyCharm, navigate to `Settings - Project Interpreter - Add Python Interpreter - Conda Environment - Existing environment`. Browse for `C:\\ProgramData\\Anaconda3` (or your install directory). Select the file named `python.exe`. I chose to edit the `Name` field of this Anaconda python interpreter as `Python 3.7 Anaconda`.\r\n 14. In PyCharm, navigate to `Settings - Build, Execution, Deployment - Console - Python Console`. Check that the `Python interpreter` field contains `Project Default (Python 3.7 Anaconda)` or similar entry. The `Environment variables` input may be empty. Select the folder button next to it and add a new entry with `PATH` and your path value (as found from the `path_value.txt` file) in the `Name` and `Value` fields, respectively. Exactly the same entries as was inputted in step 12. \r\n 15. [Optional] In PyCharm, navigate to `Settings` and search for the `Run context configuration` option. Right click it and select a desired shortcut method. Personally I use a keyboard shortcut which is set to `Ctrl+Shift+Less`. Once the rest of these steps are followed, this will allow you to run the current python .py file you have open, without having to manually set up configuration options for it (through `Add Configuration` option, next to green play button, as seen if you have no configurations set up from before). It will force PyCharm to use the default project interpreter (which now is the desired Anaconda-delivered Python 3.7 installation) for whatever project you have open. To use it, just open a .py python file with some code inside, click anywhere inside of it, and then use your shortcut option.\r\n 16. [Note: If you skipped step 15, go to step 17] Run your python file with the method from step 15. This should automatically set up a run configuration option for that file. You may get an error of missing packages. Ignore that for now.\r\n 17. Select `Edit Configuration` or `Add Configuration` in the dropdown box next to the green play / run button. Open the `Templates` tree, then select `Python`. Check that the `Python interpreter` option contains `Python 3.7 Anaconda` or similar. The `Environment variables` field may contain `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`. Regardless, select the related folder button and add a new entry with `PATH` and your path value (as found from the `path_value.txt` file) in the `Name` and `Value` fields, respectively. Exactly the same as we did in steps 12 and 14.\r\n 18. Restart PyCharm to re-initialize the `Terminal` and `Python Console` windows. Or manually close and reopen those windows.\r\n\r\n&lt;br/&gt;\r\nYou have now created and activated an (ana)conda environment, and enabled it&#39;s use from within PyCharm. You should also now be able to ie. copy your code over to a fresh new file, and then hit ie. `Ctrl+Shift+Less` to run the file without having to manually set a configuration file for it.\r\n\r\nHope this helped!\r\n\r\n**Sources:** [source1][1], [source2][2], [source3][3]\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20081338/how-to-activate-an-anaconda-environment\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49392719/get-the-anaconda-prompt-running-in-the-pycharm-terminal/55340864#55340864\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40088657/how-to-set-the-default-working-directory-for-run-configurations-in-pycharm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57971761/pycharm-not-able-to-create-conda-environment/58013163#58013163","title":"PyCharm not able to create conda environment"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12078765,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-bPyJ6ogkBP0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAFG0/xFMsH0j_5aw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sophie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12078765/sophie"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":552,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568902889,"creation_date":1568714119,"question_id":57971761,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57971761","body_markdown":"I&#39;m pretty new to programming, so maybe there&#39;s something painfully obvious that I&#39;ve missed, but I&#39;ve searched a lot around for solutions to this issue without finding any.\r\n\r\nI just got a new computer and installed Anaconda and PyCharm for Anaconda.
