You have two ways, one is generating a proposal of new assignments, and the other one is to [manually specifying][1] the leaders for specific partitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first method is well explained [here][2], just to resume it:\r\n\r\n 1. **Generate Proposed partition reassignment configuration**\r\n\r\nFirst, you should create a json file such as the provided in the link. Let&#39;s name it `topics.json`.\r\n\r\n    {&quot;topics&quot;: [{&quot;topic&quot;: &quot;foo1&quot;},\r\n                {&quot;topic&quot;: &quot;foo2&quot;}],\r\n    &quot;version&quot;:1\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis will tell kafka what are the topics you are willing to rellocate their partitions from. In the example, he wants Kafka to make a proposal for topics `foo1` and `foo2`.\r\n\r\nWith that json, call the tool and set the active broker list in the command:\r\n\r\n    kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper $ZK_HOSTS \r\n    --topics-to-move-json-file topics.json --broker-list &quot;1,2,3,4,5&quot; --generate\r\n\r\nThis will output Kafka&#39;s proposal, which you can save into another .json file. For example:\r\n\r\n    Proposed partition reassignment configuration\r\n     \r\n    {&quot;version&quot;:1,\r\n    &quot;partitions&quot;:[{&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo1&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:2,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]},\r\n                  {&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo1&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:0,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]},\r\n                  {&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo2&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:2,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]},\r\n                  {&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo2&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:0,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]},\r\n                  {&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo1&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:1,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]},\r\n                  {&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;foo2&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:1,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]}]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou can manually modify some of the assignments, if you want to (or think it&#39;s the proper think to do, as the tool is not perfect). Save the json into a file, for example, `reassign-example.json`, which will be used in the next step.\r\n\r\n 2. **Execute the Proposed partition reassignment**\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s make Kafka execute the proposal and move the partitions. For that, execute:\r\n\r\n    bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181\r\n     --reassignment-json-file reassign-example.json --execute\r\n\r\nThis will execute the partition movement defined on the `reassign-example.json` file.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second method is fairly easier, but you must manually identify the partitions you want to reassign. For example, if you want partition 1 of topic XXX to move to brokers 5 and 6, you could create a json file (`manual-reassign.json`) such as:\r\n\r\n    {&quot;version&quot;:1,&quot;partitions&quot;:[{&quot;topic&quot;:&quot;XXX&quot;,&quot;partition&quot;:1,&quot;replicas&quot;:[5,6]}]}\r\n\r\nThe way it&#39;s launched is the same as in the previous method:\r\n\r\n    bin/kafka-reassign-partitions.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181\r\n     --reassignment-json-file manual-reassign.json --execute\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope it helps!\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#basic_ops_partitionassignment\r\n  [2]: http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#basic_ops_automigrate\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202261/how-change-topic-leader-or-remove-partition-after-some-broker-down/58202775#58202775","title":"How change topic leader or remove partition after some broker down?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11962625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DB6NtJxWux0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re0hJCq6iEywXroEwwMtqSveeXDRw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sergey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11962625/sergey"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11962625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-DB6NtJxWux0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re0hJCq6iEywXroEwwMtqSveeXDRw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sergey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11962625/sergey"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570028516,"creation_date":1570021932,"last_edit_date":1570022409,"question_id":58202261,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58202261","body_markdown":"We have kafka cluster with 4 brokers and some topics with replica factor 1 and 10 partitions. \r\nAt one moment 2 of 4 our servers with kafka cluster - fail.\r\nSo now we have 2 brokers with same topics. \r\nWhen i`m run command \r\n    ./kafka_topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --describe \r\ni`m get this: \r\n\r\n    Topic:outcoming-notification-error-topic        PartitionCount:10       ReplicationFactor:1     Configs:\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 0    Leader: 2       Replicas: 2     Isr: 2\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 1    Leader: 3       Replicas: 3     Isr: 3\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 2    Leader: 4       Replicas: 4     Isr: 4\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 3    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 4    Leader: 2       Replicas: 2     Isr: 2\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 5    Leader: 3       Replicas: 3     Isr: 3\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 6    Leader: 4       Replicas: 4     Isr: 4\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 7    Leader: 1       Replicas: 1     Isr: 1\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 8    Leader: 2       Replicas: 2     Isr: 2\r\n        Topic: outcoming-error-topic       Partition: 9    Leader: 3       Replicas: 3     Isr: 3\r\n\r\nHow can i delete Leader 2...4  ? or may be i need delete partition for this Leader , but how ?\r\n\r\n \r\n UPD..\r\n\r\nAlso we use kafka_exporter for monitoring kafka with prometheus.

I would recommend subclassing UIView for your tiles and add the shadow and rounded corners in the init method, rather than adding it via the parent view controller. \r\n\r\nThe trick to getting rounded corners with a shadow is adding the shadow to the view itself, and then adding a subview for the rounded corners, which you can maskToBounds without affecting the parent. \r\n\r\nSo: \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass roundedTile: UIView {\r\n    required init?(coder: NSCoder) {\r\n        super.init(coder: coder)\r\n        \r\n        self.layer.cornerRadius = self.frame.height/2\r\n

It however pushes the possible failure to the runtime, where you now have to check if a handler is called with inappropriate argument.\r\n\r\nWhat you could also do is to make this runtime check more explicit by introducing a contract for it:\r\n\r\n    public interface IPacketHandler\r\n    {\r\n       bool CanHandlePacket(IPacket packet);\r\n       void HandlePacket(IPacket packet);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis makes it cleaner for the consumer to safely call `HandlePacket` - assuming they get a positive result from calling `CanHandlePacket` before.\r\n\r\nFor example, a possible naive loop over a list of packets and calling your handlers would become\r\n\r\n    foreach ( var packet in _packets )\r\n      foreach ( var handler in _handlers )\r\n        if (

can solve this with a little bit of reflection.\r\n\r\nFirstly, for convenience (and to help *slightly* with type-safety), introduce a &quot;Tag&quot; interface which all your `IPacketHandler&lt;T&gt;` interfaces will implement:\r\n\r\n    public interface IPacketHandlerTag // &quot;Tag&quot; interface.\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is not really necessary, but it means you can use `IEnumerable&lt;IPacketHandlerTag&gt;` instead of `IEnumerable&lt;object&gt;` later on, which does make things a little more obvious.\r\n\r\nThen your `IPacketHandler&lt;T&gt;` interface becomes:\r\n\r\n    public interface IPacketHandler&lt;in T&gt; : IPacketHandlerTag where T : IPacket\r\n    {\r\n        void HandlePacket(T packet);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you can write a `PacketHandlerManager` that uses reflection to pick out the method to use to handle a packet, and add it to a dictionary like so:\r\n\r\n    public class PacketHandlerManager\r\n    {\r\n        public PacketHandlerManager(IEnumerable&lt;IPacketHandlerTag&gt; packetHandlers)\r\n        {\r\n            foreach (var packetHandler in packetHandlers)\r\n            {\r\n                bool appropriateMethodFound = false;\r\n                var handlerType = packetHandler.GetType();\r\n                var allMethods  = handlerType.GetMethods(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance);\r\n\r\n                foreach (var method in allMethods.Where(m =&gt; m.Name == &quot;HandlePacket&quot;))\r\n                {\r\n                    var args = method.GetParameters();\r\n\r\n                    if (args.Length == 1 &amp;&amp; typeof(IPacket).IsAssignableFrom(args[0].ParameterType))\r\n                    {\r\n                        _handlers.Add(args[0].ParameterType, item =&gt; method.Invoke(packetHandler, new object[]{item}));\r\n                        appropriateMethodFound = true;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                if (!appropriateMethodFound)\r\n                    throw new InvalidOperationException(&quot;No appropriate HandlePacket() method found for type &quot; + handlerType.FullName);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public void HandlePacket(IPacket packet)\r\n        {\r\n            if (_handlers.TryGetValue(packet.GetType(), out var handler))\r\n            {\r\n                handler(packet);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(&quot;No handler found for packet type &quot; + packet.GetType().FullName);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        readonly Dictionary&lt;Type, Action&lt;IPacket&gt;&gt; _handlers = new Dictionary&lt;Type, Action&lt;IPacket&gt;&gt;(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf a packet handler passed to the `PacketHandlerManager` constructor does not implement a method called `HandlePacket` with a single argument that is assignable from `IPacket`, it will throw an `InvalidOperationException`.\r\n\r\nFor example, attempting to use an instance of the following class would cause the constructor to throw:\r\n\r\n    public class BadPacketHandler: IPacketHandlerTag\r\n    {\r\n        public void HandlePacket(string packet)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Handling string&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you can call use it thusly:\r\n\r\n        var packetHandlers = new List&lt;IPacketHandlerTag&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            new FooPacketHandler(),\r\n            new BarPacketHandler()\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        var manager = new PacketHandlerManager(packetHandlers);\r\n\r\n        var foo = new FooPacket();\r\n        var bar = new BarPacket();\r\n        var baz = new BazPacket();\r\n\r\n        manager.HandlePacket(foo);\r\n        manager.HandlePacket(bar);\r\n        manager.HandlePacket(baz);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPutting it all together into a compilable console app:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Collections.Generic;\r\n    using System.Linq;\r\n    using System.Reflection;\r\n\r\n    namespace ConsoleApp1\r\n    {\r\n        public interface IPacket\r\n

immediate problem is that FooPacketHandler is `IPacketHandler&lt;FooPacket&gt;`, with a `HandlePacket(FooPacket)` method. It is explicitly announcing that it can&#39;t handle just any arbitrary object that implements `IPacket`. All it&#39;s willing to handle is `FooPacket`. `IPacketHandler&lt;IPacket&gt;` would have a much more general `HandlePacket(IPacket)` method. The compiler balks when you say your object is one of those, because your object clearly insists that it&#39;s something else entirely. If you had an interface like `IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;` which only *emits* `T`s, that&#39;d be fine:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic interface IPacketProducer&lt;out T&gt; where T : IPacket\r\n{\r\n    T ProducePacket();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`IPacketProducer&lt;FooPacket&gt;.ProducePacket()` *is* guaranteed to return something that implements IPacket. But that doesn&#39;t address your problem, because you&#39;re handling packets, not creating them. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how I might do it. Whether this works for your case will depend on exactly what you need from packet handling, and how much you need to decouple packets from their handlers. The basic principle is: When you&#39;ve got an `IPacket`, there&#39;s a concrete class instance behind it that knows exactly what he is. So whatever you need to do that depends on his actual type, just ask him. \r\n\r\nMaybe `HandlePacket()` or `GetPacketHandler()` or both should have parameters, maybe `HandlePacket()` doesn&#39;t need to return anything. \r\n\r\n```C#\r\npublic interface IPacket\r\n{\r\n    int Size { get; }\r\n    IPacketHandler GetPacketHandler();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface IPacketHandler {\r\n    IHandleResult HandlePacket();\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic interface IHandleResult\r\n{\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class FooPacketHandler : IPacketHandler\r\n{\r\n    private FooPacket _fp;\r\n    public FooPacketHandler(FooPacket fp)\r\n    {\r\n        _fp = fp;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public IHandleResult HandlePacket()\r\n    {\r\n        //  Stuff.\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class FooPacket : IPacket\r\n{\r\n    public int Size =&gt; 10;\r\n    public string FooProperty { get; set; }\r\n\r\n    public IPacketHandler GetPacketHandler() =&gt; new FooPacketHandler(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar result = GetSomePacketFromSomewhere().GetPacketHandler().HandlePacket();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll the generics were doing for you was antagonizing the compiler. Just because you&#39;ve got a hammer doesn&#39;t mean you need to eat your eggs with it.

I have already implemented a callback able to calculate the precision/recall for each class and their macro average. But for some technical reason, I have to calculate them using the metrics mechanism.  \r\n\r\nI&#39;m using TensorFlow 2 and Keras 2.3.0. I have already used the ```tensorflow.keras.metrics.Recall/Precision``` to get the class-wise metrics:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\nmetrics_list = [&#39;accuracy&#39;]\r\n    metrics_list.extend([Recall(class_id=i, name=&quot;recall_{}&quot;.format(label_names[i])) for i in range(n_category)])\r\n    metrics_list.extend([Precision(class_id=i, name=&quot;precision_{}&quot;.format(label_names[i])) for i in range(n_category)])\r\n\r\nmodel = Model(...)\r\nmodel.compile(...metrics=metrics_list)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this solution is not satisfying:\r\n\r\n1. firstly, ```tensorflow.keras.metrics.Recall/Precision``` uses a threshold to define the affiliation to a class, while it should use ```argmax``` to define the most probable class, if ```class_id``` is defined\r\n\r\n2. Secondly, I have to create 2 new metrics that would calculate the average over all classes, which itself requires to calculate the class-wise metrics. This is inelegant and inefficient to calculate twice the same thing.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to create a class or a function that would calculate directly the class-wise and the average predicion/recall using the TensorFlow/Keras metrics logic? \r\n\r\nApparently I can easily obtain the confusion matrix using ```tf.math.confusion_matrix()```.

I am taking an actual `Eigen::Vector` as an argument, not an expression.\r\n\r\nIf there was an expression it would be fine for me, to have it materialized.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, if I try to follow their instruction and just use `ArrayBase&lt;Derived&gt;`, I lose the compile-time information about `T` and `dim`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202188/taking-eigenvector-as-a-parameter","title":"Taking Eigen::Vector as a parameter"},{"tags":["c#"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12008,"user_id":2846483,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Bfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dymanoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846483/dymanoid"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1570021759,"post_id":58202186,"comment_id":102782293,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202186/acces-class-variable-in-dictionary-initializer-syntax-c#comment102782293_58202186"},{"owner":{"reputation":399,"user_id":5221139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b72e2204f13d40fc251e31765d568699?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Drago","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221139/drago"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12008,"user_id":2846483,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Bfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dymanoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846483/dymanoid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570022171,"post_id":58202186,"comment_id":102782581,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202186/acces-class-variable-in-dictionary-initializer-syntax-c#comment102782581_58202186"},{"owner":{"reputation":12008,"user_id":2846483,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Bfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dymanoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846483/dymanoid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570022331,"post_id":58202186,"comment_id":102782689,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202186/acces-class-variable-in-dictionary-initializer-syntax-c#comment102782689_58202186"},{"owner":{"reputation":399,"user_id":5221139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b72e2204f13d40fc251e31765d568699?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Drago","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221139/drago"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":12008,"user_id":2846483,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/X2Bfs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dymanoid","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2846483/dymanoid"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570022425,"post_id":58202186,"comment_id":102782746,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202186/acces-class-variable-in-dictionary-initializer-syntax-c#comment102782746_58202186"}],"owner":{"reputation":399,"user_id":5221139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b72e2204f13d40fc251e31765d568699?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Drago","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221139/drago"},"last_editor":{"reputation":399,"user_id":5221139,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b72e2204f13d40fc251e31765d568699?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Drago","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221139/drago"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570022464,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570021843,"creation_date":1570021654,"last_edit_date":1570021843,"question_id":58202186,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58202186","body_markdown":"       public class MenuBar\r\n        {\r\n            [FindsBy(How = How.XPath, Using = &quot;//i[@class=&#39;r-icon icon-meter&#39;]&quot;)]\r\n            private IWebElement mnuItemDashboard;\r\n    \r\n            [FindsBy(How = How.XPath, Using = &quot;//i[@class=&#39;r-icon icon-office&#39;]&quot;)]\r\n            private IWebElement mnuItemData;\r\n    \r\n            public static enum MenuItem\r\n            {\r\n                Dashboard,\r\n                Data\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            private Dictionary&lt;MenuItem, IWebElement&gt; menuItemdict =\r\n            {\r\n                {MenuItem.Dashboard, mnuItemDashboard}, //mnuItemDashboard is not visible/accessible here.\r\n                {MenuItem.Data, mnuItemData} //mnuItemData is not visible/accessible here.\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using dictionary initializer syntax to intialize `menuItemdict`.

    Application.EnableEvents = False\r\n        ThisWorkbook.RefreshAll\r\n        Application.EnableEvents = True\r\n            \r\n        If Not Intersect(Target, Me.Range(&quot;A2:J2&quot;)) Is Nothing Then\r\n            ThisWorkbook.Save\r\n        End If\r\n        \r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nWill the main VBA code is in the module1.\r\nBut it crashes or gets stuck in a loop...\r\n\r\nThanks for the help.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202139/vba-event-sequence-after-data-connection-refresh","title":"vba event sequence after data connection

default value of slider is set using `value` property. To show initial value in your label, you need to add a `create` callback, which is being called right after the slider was initialized. Then, you need to add a `slide` callback to react to sliding event and change label&#39;s value accordingly. Lastly, I removed a hidden input field and showed you how to retrieve a value from the slider itself using a button click. If you need a value to be saved in a hidden input field instead, then you can modify `setSliderValue` function like that:\r\n\r\n    function setSliderValue(value) {\r\n      $sliderLabel.text(value + &quot; kg&quot;);\r\n      $(&quot;#your-hidden-field-id&quot;).val(value);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBellow is the full working example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var defaultValue = 60;\r\n    var $sliderLabel = $(&quot;.slider-after&quot;);\r\n\r\n    function setSliderValue(value) {\r\n      $sliderLabel.text(value + &quot; kg&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var $gewichtSlider = $(&quot;#gewicht-slider&quot;).slider({\r\n        min: 40,\r\n        max: 200,\r\n        value: defaultValue,\r\n        create: function() {\r\n          setSliderValue(defaultValue);\r\n        },\r\n        slide: function(event, ui) {\r\n        \tsetSliderValue(ui.value);\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    $(&quot;#current-value&quot;).click(function() {\r\n    \talert($gewichtSlider.slider( &quot;value&quot; ) + &quot; kg&quot;);\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui-touch-punch/0.2.3/jquery.ui.touch-punch.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link href=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.min.css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;/&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;gewicht-container question-container&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;label for=&quot;gewicht&quot;&gt;Wie schwer bist du?&lt;/label&gt;\r\n      &lt;p class=&quot;question-desc&quot;&gt;Dies ist eine wichtige Angabe f&#252;r die Matraztenh&#228;rte.

have sequences of different lengths, and I want to train an LSTM based neural network that will predict each `Nth` token using the `N-1` tokens preceding it.\r\n\r\nHowever, the results of the training are strange; after a few epochs the accuracy (in both train and validation) drops to nearly 0, while the loss also drops to nearly 0. \r\n \r\n\r\nDue to its unexplainable behavior (described [here][1]), I decided to dig deeper, and see what is predicted by each iteration of the model.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I want to load each model and use it to make prediction for the validation data, and compare it to the metrics generated by the original fitting of the model.  \r\n\r\nThe problem is, I get the following error message:\r\n\r\n      File

Specifically: We&#39;ve been arguing about the proper use of `Try / Catch` and `If / Else` as well as `First() / Single()` in a specific scenario.\r\n\r\n**Variation #1**  - His approach\r\n\r\n    var items = Search(dto.number); // Returns a List of Objects\r\n    if (items.Count = 1)\r\n    {\r\n        wPerson = items.First();\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n**Variation #2** - I changed his code to this.\r\n \r\n    var items = Search(dto.number); // Returns a List of Objects\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        wPerson = items.Single();\r\n    }\r\n    catch\r\n    {\r\n        // Handle exception\r\n        return;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWe expect the result of `var items = Search(dto.number);` to always be 1.\r\n\r\n**The Question:**\r\nWhich changes were nescessary? I am trying to defend my point of view below. Please correct me.\r\n \r\n\r\nFirst of all: The `Single()`. I always try to be as specific as possible and I decided on the following rules:\r\n\r\n&gt;  - First --&gt; Accepts N\r\n&gt;  - FirstOrDefault --&gt; Accepts 0 and N\r\n&gt;  - Single --&gt; Accepts 1\r\n&gt;  - SingleOrDefault --&gt; Accepts 0 and 1\r\n\r\n`First()` may have worked but it wasn&#39;t 100% specific, so I considered it wrong since we had an option to be even more specific. \r\n\r\nSecondly: `Try / Catch` vs `If / Else`. Since I had already changed `First()` to `Single()`, I considered the `if` statement to be redundant. Yes. I know that `Try / Catch` is less performant than the `If` statement but we expect to have NOTHING BUT 1 result. And if we get more or less, I expect it to be a mistake and with `Try / Catch` I&#39;d actually treat it that way.\r\n\r\nAm I so off here?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202079/prioritization-of-if-else-try-catch-and-first-vs-single","title":"Prioritization of IF-ELSE / TRY-CATCH and First() vs Single()"},{"tags":["c#",".net-core","entity-framework-core"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570021421,"post_id":58202074,"comment_id":102782103,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202074/accessing-model-property-that-has-the-inverseproperty-annotation-result-in-nullr#comment102782103_58202074"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9787983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9787983/rune"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570033449,"post_id":58202074,"comment_id":102789198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202074/accessing-model-property-that-has-the-inverseproperty-annotation-result-in-nullr#comment102789198_58202074"},{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570033991,"post_id":58202074,"comment_id":102789477,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202074/accessing-model-property-that-has-the-inverseproperty-annotation-result-in-nullr#comment102789477_58202074"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9787983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9787983/rune"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570035210,"post_id":58202074,"comment_id":102790038,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202074/accessing-model-property-that-has-the-inverseproperty-annotation-result-in-nullr#comment102790038_58202074"},{"owner":{"reputation":21168,"user_id":5015238,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f8790f8091d3c6c58fd45664a165117a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"jdweng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5015238/jdweng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570035787,"post_id":58202074,"comment_id":102790307,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202074/accessing-model-property-that-has-the-inverseproperty-annotation-result-in-nullr#comment102790307_58202074"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9787983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9787983/rune"},"last_editor":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9787983,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"rune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9787983/rune"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570034471,"creation_date":1570021280,"last_edit_date":1570034471,"question_id":58202074,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58202074","body_markdown":"NOTE: I do get a valid result from the .Find(id) &#39;query&#39;.

To ensure that both elements aren&#39;t trying to update each other at the same instance, maintain a scroll state that is updated when either of them fires the scroll handler.\r\n\r\nPlease find an updated version of your fiddle: [link to fiddle][1]\r\n\r\n    new Vue({\r\n      el: &#39;#app&#39;,\r\n      data: {\r\n        message: &#39;Very loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeexttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt&#39;,\r\n        scrolling: false\r\n      },\r\n      methods: {\r\n      \thandleScroll1: function () {\r\n        \t\tif(this.scrolling) {\r\n            \tthis.scrolling = false;\r\n              return;\r\n            }\r\n        \t\tthis.scrolling = true;\r\n          console.log(this.scrolling, this.$refs[&quot;wrapper1&quot;].scrollLeft);\r\n          this.$refs[&quot;wrapper2&quot;].scrollLeft = this.$refs[&quot;wrapper1&quot;].scrollLeft;\r\n        },\r\n      \thandleScroll2: function () {\r\n        \t\tif(this.scrolling) {\r\n            \tthis.scrolling = false;\r\n              return;\r\n            }\r\n        \t\tthis.scrolling = true;\r\n          console.log(this.scrolling, this.$refs[&quot;wrapper2&quot;].scrollLeft);\r\n          this.$refs[&quot;wrapper1&quot;].scrollLeft = this.$refs[&quot;wrapper2&quot;].scrollLeft;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n\r\nAs a side note i want to suggest that you learn Vanilla JS, it&#39;ll give you a better grasp of javascript, and also make it easy for you to understand any piece of code in whatever framework so you can always adapt it to your needs.\r\nThis answer is based on a similar one by [StanleyH and HoldOffHunger][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jsfiddle.net/phainix/095qhLgc/1/\r\n  [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3934271/horizontal-scrollbar-on-top-and-bottom-of-table/50776007#50776007","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202068/how-to-add-scroll-second-scroll-to-top-like-bottom-scroll/58203688#58203688","title":"How to add scroll second scroll to top like bottom scroll?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2651,"user_id":1432751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e80f2b22b8c98730708ad3842c11604b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Bubnenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1432751/dmitry-bubnenkov"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2651,"user_id":1432751,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e80f2b22b8c98730708ad3842c11604b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dmitry Bubnenkov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1432751/dmitry-bubnenkov"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58203688,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570026701,"creation_date":1570021255,"last_edit_date":1570022670,"question_id":58202068,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58202068","body_markdown":"I have Vue component that greater than browser size.

For example, I&#39;ve got a web-page returning a carousel of images using a javascript library called owl carousel. If I render the html on the server by adding html for each image and then send it, the carousel works as intended. However, If instead I use Vue to make a request for these images on the client-side (before Mounting) then render them, the carousel doesn&#39;t work. It seems to be related to the fact that the owl carousel script doesn&#39;t add a div that it needs to when loaded the Vue.js way. I was wondering why this is the case? Especially considering the vue script is in the middle of the document whereas the owl-carousel script resides at the bottom and therefore is executed after the vue script. I think this is less a question about owl-carousel and vue specifically as much as vue with any js library that isn&#39;t vue. \r\n\r\nHere is the working code that uses handlebars to render the html on the server:\r\n\r\n    {{#each locations}}\r\n\r\n                        &lt;!-- Item --&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div class=&quot;col-md-4 col-lg-4 mb-md-10&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;div @mouseover=&quot;hover = true&quot; @mouseleave=&quot;hover = &#39;&#39;&quot; class=&quot;blog-media&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 5px;&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n                                &lt;el-avatar v-if=&quot;hover == true&quot; class=&quot;like-button&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/el-avatar&gt;\r\n\r\n                                &lt;ul class=&quot;clearlist content-slider&quot;&gt;\r\n                                    {{#each this.images}}\r\n\r\n                                        &lt;li&gt;\r\n                                            &lt;a href=&quot;/locations/{{../id}}&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{{this.url}}&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;object-fit: cover; height:240px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                    {{/each}}\r\n\r\n                                &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                            &lt;span style=&quot;color:gray; display: inline-block; float:  left; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;{{this.locationReference}}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                            \r\n                            &lt;span style=&quot;color:black; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; float: right; padding-right: 5px;&quot;&gt; London&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                    {{/each}}\r\n\r\nwhich results in a working output: \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhereas the vue.js rendering does not work: \r\n\r\n    &lt;div v-if=&quot;!loading&quot; v-for=&quot;location in locations&quot; class=&quot;col-md-4 col-lg-4 mb-md-10&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 20px;&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;div @mouseover=&quot;hover = true&quot; @mouseleave=&quot;hover = &#39;&#39;&quot; class=&quot;blog-media&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom: 5px;&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n                            &lt;el-avatar v-if=&quot;hover == true&quot; class=&quot;like-button&quot;&gt;&lt;i class=&quot;fa fa-heart&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/el-avatar&gt;\r\n\r\n                            &lt;ul class=&quot;clearlist content-slider&quot;&gt;\r\n                                \r\n                                    &lt;li v-for=&quot;image in location.images&quot;&gt;\r\n                                        &lt;a href=&quot;/locations/&quot;&gt;&lt;img :src=&quot;image.url&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;object-fit: cover; height:240px;&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                                \r\n                            &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        &lt;span style=&quot;color:gray; display: inline-block; float:  left; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;\\{{location.locationReference}}&lt;/span&gt;\r\n                        &lt;span style=&quot;color:black; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; float: right; padding-right: 5px;&quot;&gt; London&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/CS4OT.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5MQOQ.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nIf anyone can help enlighten my misunderstanding of how scripts work together, I&#39;d be very grateful.

The second item, in your case, it *could* be that the GPU is occupied by the first exe, hence, the second exe was waiting.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nSome suggestion for you code:\r\n\r\n````\r\n//file.cpp\r\n#include &lt;memory&gt;\r\n\r\nstd::shared_ptr&lt;Unets&gt; init()  // initialization of those class objects\r\n{\r\n    //Unets TT;  // error: &#39;Unets::Unets(void)&#39;:attempting to reference a deleted function\r\n               // error: the default constructor of &quot;Unets&quot; cannot be referenced -- it is a deleted function\r\n    auto TT = std::make_shared&lt;Unets&gt;();\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    return TT;\r\n}\r\n\r\nLIB_API void inference(pic3)  // the function c# calling for each inference\r\n{\r\n    //Unets TT2;  // error: the default constructor of &quot;Unets&quot; cannot be referenced -- it is a deleted function\r\n    auto TT2 = init();\r\n    TT2-&gt;A.predict(pic3);\r\n}\r\n\r\n````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58202051/why-does-it-fail-to-declare-a-class-globally-in-c-which-is-built-to-be-a-dll-f/58202725#58202725","title":"Why does it fail to declare a class globally in c++ which is built to be a dll file?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":10427809,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Sv0RfgePsSA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAgU/tayvEtbVw58/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Coco Yen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10427809/coco-yen"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58202725,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570169235,"creation_date":1570021195,"question_id":58202051,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58202051","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on a project which required a dll file for another program written in c# to use.

I made all the model&#39;s function a class(including __*initialize*__ and __*inference*__). \r\n\r\nThere are more than 1 model I use in the project, and the models won&#39;t be modified after they&#39;re initialized.

If it is, I think it&#39;s not a good idea to write like this, so I&#39;m stuck in here...\r\n\r\n\r\nTo sum up, I want to know...\r\n\r\n__1. Why the global class I declared as the FIRST way failed while running in c#?__\r\n\r\n__2. Is the last method an option to work?
