training loop alternative    \r\n\r\nThe only thing I can think of is a manual training loop where you get the weights yourself.\r\n\r\nHave a weights tensor and a non variable batch size:\r\n\r\n    weights = K.variable(np.zeros((batch_size,)))\r\n\r\nUse them in your custom loss:\r\n\r\n    def custom_loss(true, pred):\r\n        return someCalculation(true, pred, weights)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a &quot;generator&quot;:\r\n\r\n    for e in range(epochs):\r\n        for s in range(steps_per_epoch):\r\n            x, y, w = next(generator) #or generator.next(), not sure\r\n            K.set_value(weights, w)\r\n\r\n            model.train_on_batch(x, y)\r\n\r\nFor a `keras.utils.Sequence`:\r\n\r\n    for e in range(epochs):\r\n        for s in range(len(generator)):\r\n

working toward optimization the first step is to time how long it takes just to read the input file, and do nothing with it.  On my system that takes only a few hundredths of a second for a 10MB file.  \r\n\r\nSo now we know the least amount of time it&#39;s going to take, we need to look at optimization strategies.  In your example code you are opening `parts.txt` and reading that file from the filesystem for every record in your input file.  So you&#39;re expanding the amount of work needed considerably. It would be nicer if you could keep the parts file in memory and just grab a random element from it for each record from your input file.\r\n\r\nThe next optimization you can make is to avoid shuffling the list of parts each time you need a part. Better to grab a random element, than to shuffle the elements.\r\n\r\nYou can also skip any processing for any records that don&#39;t begin with CAR, but that seems to be a lesser advantage.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the following accomplishes those objectives:\r\n\r\n    #!/usr/bin/env perl\r\n    \r\n    use strict;\r\n    use warnings;\r\n    use Getopt::Long;\r\n    use Time::HiRes qw(time);\r\n    \r\n    my ($parts_file, $input_file, $output_file) = (&#39;parts.txt&#39;, &#39;input.txt&#39;, &#39;output.txt&#39;);\r\n    \r\n    GetOptions(\r\n        &quot;parts=s&quot;,  \\$parts_file,\r\n        &quot;input=s&quot;,  \\$input_file,\r\n        &quot;output=s&quot;, \\$output_file,\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    my $t0 = time;\r\n    chomp(\r\n        my @parts = do {\r\n            open my $fh, &#39;&lt;&#39;, $parts_file or die &quot;Cannot open $parts_file: $!\\n&quot;;\r\n            &lt;$fh&gt;;\r\n        }\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n    open my $input_fh, &#39;&lt;&#39;, $input_file or die &quot;Cannot open $input_file for input: $!\\n&quot;;\r\n    local $/ = &#39;~&#39;;\r\n    \r\n    open my $out_fh,   &#39;&gt;&#39;, $output_file or die &quot;Cannot open $output_file for output: $!\\n&quot;;\r\n    \r\n    my $rec_count = 0;\r\n    while (my $rec = &lt;$input_fh&gt;) {\r\n        chomp $rec;\r\n        $rec =~ s{^\r\n            (CAR\\*(?:[^*]+\\*){2})\r\n            [^*]+\r\n        }{\r\n            $1 . $parts[int(rand(@parts))]\r\n        }xe;\r\n        ++$rec_count;\r\n        print $out_fh &quot;$rec$/&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    close $out_fh or die &quot;Cannot close output file $output_file: $!\\n&quot;;\r\n    printf &quot;Elapsed time: %-.03f\\nRecords: %d\\n&quot;, time-$t0, $rec_count;\r\n\r\nOn my system a file consisting of 488321 records (approximately 10MB in size) takes 0.588 seconds to process.\r\n\r\nFor your own needs you will want to take this Perl script and modify it to have more robust handling of filenames and filesystem paths. That&#39;s not part of the question that was asked, though.  The primary objective of this code is to demonstrate where optimizations can be taken; moving work out of the loop, for example; we only open the parts file once, we read it once, and we never shuffle; we just grab a random item from our in-memory list of parts.\r\n\r\nSince command-line &quot;one-liners&quot; are so convenient, we should see if this can be boiled down to one. Mostly equivalent functionality can be achieved in a Perl &quot;one-liner&quot; by using the `-l`, `-a`, `-p`, `-F`, and `-e` switches(I&#39;m taking the liberty of letting it flow to multiple lines, though):\r\n\r\n    perl -l0176  -apF&#39;\\*&#39; -e &#39;\r\n        BEGIN{\r\n            local $/ = &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n            chomp(@parts = do {open $fh, &quot;&lt;&quot;, shift(@ARGV); &lt;$fh&gt;})\r\n        }\r\n        $F[0] =~ m/^CAR/ &amp;&amp; $F[3] =~ s/^\\w+$/$parts[int(rand(@parts))]/e;\r\n        $_ = join(&quot;*&quot;, @F);\r\n    &#39; parts.txt input.txt &gt;output.txt\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s how it works:\r\n\r\nThe `-p` switch tells Perl to iterate over every line in the file specified on the command line, or if none is specified, over STDIN.  For each line, place the line&#39;s value into `$_`, and before moving on to the next line, print the contents of `$_` to STDOUT. This gives us the opportunity to modify `$_` such that changes get written to STDOUT. But we use the `-l` switch which lets us specify an octal value representing a different record separator. In this case we use the octal value for the `~` character.  This causes `-p` to iterate over records separated by `~` instead of `\\n`.  Also the `-l` switch strips record separators on input, and replaces them on output.\r\n\r\nHowever, we also use the `-a` and `-F` switches.  `-a` tells Perl to auto-split the input into the `@F` array, and `-F` lets us specify that we want to autosplit on the `*` character. Because `-F` accepts a PCRE pattern, and `*` is considered a quantifier in PCRE, we escape it with a backslash.\r\n\r\nNext the `-e` switch says to evaluate the following string as code.  Finally we can discuss the string of code. First there is a `BEGIN{...}` block which shifts one value off of `@ARGV` and uses it as a name of a file to open to read the parts list from.  Once that filename has been shifted off, it won&#39;t be considered for reading by the `-p` switch later in the script (the BEGIN block happens before the implicit `-p` loop).  So just consider that the code in the `BEGIN{...}` block temporarily sets the record separator back to newlines, reads the parts file into an array, and then relinquishes the record separator back to being `~` again.\r\n\r\nNow we can move on past the begin block.  `@F` has become the container holding the fields within a given record. The 4th field (offset 3) is the one you wish to swap. Check if the first field (offset 0) starts with `CAR`. If it does, set the contents of the 4th field to a random element from our parts array, but only if that field consists of one or more characters.\r\n\r\nThen we join back together the fields, delimited with an asterisk and assign that result back to `$_`. Our work is done. Thanks to the `-p` switch, Perl writes the contents of `$_` to STDOUT and then appends the record separator, `~`.\r\n\r\nFinally on the command line we first specify the path to the parts file, then the path to the input file, and then redirect STDOUT to our output file.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999182/while-loop-performance-extremely-slow/58000289#58000289","title":"While Loop Performance : Extremely

absolutely agree that there are languages other than bash which will be both easier and faster.\r\n\r\nStill, some days I can&#39;t resist a challenge. The key to making shell scripts run fast is to do as little as possible in the shell; try to find a way to use external utilities to work in bulk instead of line by line.\r\n\r\nThe following shell script is a crude example. It does several things in order to avoid looping in shell:\r\n\r\n* The Gnu version of `shuf` provides the `-r` flag to generate a (potentially infinite) sequence of random lines taken from its input, instead of shuffling the input.\r\n\r\n* The `paste` command does line-by-line concatenation of two input streams. (Unfortunately, it does not have a way of stopping when the shortest stream finishes, so you can&#39;t use it with an infinite stream. That forces an awkward extra scan of the input text in order to count the number of lines.)\r\n\r\n* It&#39;s possible to encode the criteria &quot;the first field is `CAR` and the fourth field is not empty&quot; as a single regular expression. That lets us do all the selection and substitution with a single invocation of `sed`.\r\n\r\n* The input file uses `~` instead of newline to delimit records, which is awkward for most Linux text file tools. We can use `tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39;` to turn the tildes into newlines and `tr &#39;\\n&#39; &#39;~&#39;` to turn newlines back into tildes at the end.\r\n\r\nSo here&#39;s the script:\r\n\r\n    # Count the number of &quot;lines&quot; in the input:\r\n    count=$(tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39; &lt;input.txt | wc -l)\r\n    # (paste) Paste together a column of random parts with the original input;\r\n    # (sed)   then substitute  what is now the fifth column with the new first column\r\n    #         if the criteria are met.\r\n    # (cut)   Finally strip out the column of random parts and\r\n    # (tr)    restore the record terminator ~ to return to the original format:\r\n    paste -d &#39;*&#39; &lt;(shuf -rn$count parts.txt) \\\r\n                 &lt;(tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39; &lt;input.txt) |\r\n    sed -E &#39;s/^([^*]+)([*]CAR([*][^*]+){2}[*])[^*]+/\\1\\2\\1/&#39; |\r\n    cut -f2- -d&#39;*&#39; |\r\n    tr &#39;\\n&#39; &#39;~&#39;\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s a sample run:\r\n\r\n    # The input is 500,000 lines -- about 10MB -- created at random\r\n    # from the short input data in the question\r\n    $ tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39; &lt; input.txt | wc\r\n    500000  500000 10498615\r\n    $ tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39; &lt; input.txt | head\r\n    CAR*BMW*X5*SEAT\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    CAR*GM*YUKON**\r\n    CAR*BMW*X1*BUMBER*PLATE\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*HOOD\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*HOOD\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*HOOD\r\n    CAR*FORD*FUSION*QNX\r\n\r\n    # The script takes a couple of seconds\r\n    $ time ./xform.sh &gt; output.txt\r\n    \r\n    real    0m1.517s\r\n    user    0m1.690s\r\n    sys     0m0.121s\r\n\r\n    # It seems to do the right thing:\r\n    $ tr &#39;~&#39; &#39;\\n&#39; &lt; output.txt | head\r\n    CAR*BMW*X5*NXP\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    CAR*GM*YUKON**\r\n    CAR*BMW*X1*GOOGLE*PLATE\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    SUV*FORD*EXPLORER*GLASS*SAFE\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*GOOGLE\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*BLACKBERRY\r\n    CAR*AUDI*A5*BLACKBERRY\r\n    CAR*FORD*FUSION*NXP\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a version of the above script which requires you to specify the value of field 0 (&quot;`$segment`&quot;) and the field number to substitute (&quot;`$position`&quot;) as script parameters. It completely lacks checks on the validity of arguments, and it doesn&#39;t provide default values either. A robust script would do better. But it hopefully gives some idea as to how to parameterise the script.

What I want is that when someone tries to drag first 2 rows of that table, a popup or tooltip or some kind of alert shows up telling that it can&#39;t be dragged.\r\n\r\nI Went through the antd&#39;s documentation and found it it had two methods that might be handy, namely `onRow()` which have event like `onMouseEnter()`, `onClick()`  and `rowClassName()` which sets `css` on rows. But they don&#39;t serve my purpose because I only want to show the message when someone tries to drag it.\r\n\r\nRight now I am showing an alert message when someone tries to click on the specific rows:\r\n\r\n    &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\r\n      {this.state.isHovered &amp;&amp; \r\n       &lt;Alert \r\n        message=&quot;Can&#39;t be Dragged!&quot; status=&quot;success&quot; \r\n        closable \r\n        onClose={this.onClose} \r\n       /&gt;\r\n      }\r\n      &lt;DndProvider backend={HTML5Backend}&gt;\r\n        &lt;Table\r\n          className=&quot;components-table-demo-nested&quot;\r\n          columns={columns}\r\n          expandedRowRender={this.renderContentTable}\r\n          dataSource={_.cloneDeep(this.props.sections)}\r\n          components={this.components}\r\n          onRow={(record, index) =&gt; ({\r\n            index,\r\n            onClick: event =&gt; {\r\n              if (index === 1) {\r\n                this.setState({ isHovered: true })\r\n              }\r\n            },\r\n            moveRow: this.moveRow\r\n            }\r\n          )}\r\n            pagination={false}\r\n            rowKey=&#39;key&#39;\r\n         /&gt;\r\n     &lt;/DndProvider&gt;\r\n\r\nThe way I am making sure that first two rows are not moved, is by this code:\r\n\r\n    const rowTarget = {\r\n      drop(props, monitor) {\r\n        const dragIndex = monitor.getItem().index;\r\n        const hoverIndex = props.index;\r\n\r\n        if (dragIndex === hoverIndex) {\r\n          return;\r\n        } else if (dragIndex === 0 || dragIndex === 1) {\r\n          return;\r\n        } else if (hoverIndex === 0 || hoverIndex === 1) {\r\n          return;\r\n        }\r\n        props.moveRow(dragIndex, hoverIndex);\r\n        monitor.getItem().index = hoverIndex;\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n\r\nExpected is that when someone tries to drag first two rows of my table, a tooltip preferably shows up notifying that it shouldn&#39;t be done. In actual, I have not found anything that could help me. Your help in this regard would highly be appreciated.

Seal\r\n\r\nThe list of words to look for is (I shortened it to 2):\r\n\r\n    words = [&#39;the&#39;, &#39;seven&#39;]\r\n\r\nThen, to generate your result, run:\r\n\r\n    pd.DataFrame([ [wrd] + [ df[col].str.extractall(f&#39;(\\\\b{wrd}\\\\b)&#39;,\r\n        flags=re.I).size for col in df.columns ] for wrd in words ],\r\n        columns=[&#39;Word&#39;, *df])\r\n\r\nNote `\\b` (word boundary anchor) in regex, both before and after the\r\nword to look for.\r\nThis ensures that if you look for word *the*, there will be found all\r\ncases of just *the*, leaving out e.g. such words like *there*, *Athena*\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nNote also `re.I` flag, to perform case insensitive search (you have to\r\n*import re*).\r\n\r\nThe result, for my sample data, is:\r\n\r\n        Word  Aaa  Bbb  Ccc\r\n    0    the    1    3    1\r\n    1  seven    0    1

me talk first the base case with `K &lt; N`, the idea in this case is to split the array in two parts `A` and `B`, `A` is the first N-K elements array and `B` the last K elements. the algorithm reverse `A` and `B` separately and finally reverse the full array (with the two part reversed separately). To manage the case with `K &gt; N`, think that every time you reverse the array N times you obtain the original array again so we can just use the module operator to find where to split the array (reversing only the really useful times avoiding useless shifting).\r\n\r\n**Graphical Example**\r\n\r\nA graphical step by step example can help understanding better the concept. Note that\r\n\r\n - The bold line indicate the the splitting point of the array (`K = 3` in this example);\r\n - The red array indicate the input and the expected output.\r\n\r\nStarting from:\r\n\r\n[![starting array][1]][1]\r\n\r\nlook that what we want in front of the final output will be the last 3 letter reversed, for now let reverse it in place (first reverse of the algorithm):\r\n\r\n[![first_pass_array][2]][2]\r\n\r\nnow reverse the first N-K elements (second reverse of the algorithm):\r\n\r\n[![second_pass_array][3]][3]\r\n\r\nwe already have the solution but in the opposite direction, we can solve it reversing the whole array (third and last reverse of the algorithm): \r\n\r\n[![final_array][4]][4]\r\n\r\nHere the final output, the original array cyclical rotated with K = 3. \r\n\r\n**Code Example**\r\n\r\nLet give also another step by step example with python code, starting from:\r\n\r\n    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n    K = 22\r\n    N = len(A)\r\n\r\nwe find the splitting index:\r\n\r\n    K = K%N\r\n    #2\r\n\r\nbecause, in this case, the first 20 shift will be useless, now we reverse the last K (2) elements of the original array:\r\n\r\n    reverse(A, N-K, N-1)\r\n    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 9]\r\nas you can see 9 and 10 has been shift, now we reverse the first N-K elements:\r\n\r\n    reverse(A, 0, N-K-1)\r\n    # [8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 10, 9]\r\nAnd, finally, we reverse the full array:\r\n\r\n    reverse(A, 0, N-1)\r\n    # [9, 10, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\r\n\r\nNote that reversing an array have time complexity O(N).  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/yukq1.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/vyDey.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/3meWw.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/haPYd.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999103/cyclic-rotation-of-array-explanation/57999736#57999736","title":"Cyclic rotation of array explanation"}],"owner":{"reputation":2747,"user_id":3019105,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/efrpY.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tonix","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3019105/tonix"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":79,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57999736,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568837991,"creation_date":1568832372,"question_id":57999103,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999103","body_markdown":"Premise: My question is not a duplicate of https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54843674/cyclic-rotation-in-python . I am not asking how to resolve the problem or why my solution does not work, I have already resolved it and it works. My question is about another particular solution to the same problem I found, because I would like to understand the logic behind the other solution.\r\n\r\nI came across the following cyclic array rotation problem (below the sources):\r\n\r\n - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54843674/cyclic-rotation-in-python\r\n - https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/2-arrays/cyclic_rotation/\r\n\r\n&gt; An array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is moved to the first place. For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7] (elements are shifted right by one index and 6 is moved to the first place).\r\nThe goal is to rotate array A K times; that is, each element of A will be shifted to the right K times.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich I managed to solve with the following Python code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef solution(A , K):\r\n    N = len(A)\r\n    if N &lt; 1 or N == K:\r\n        return A\r\n    K = K % N\r\n    for x in range(K):\r\n        tmp = A[N - 1]\r\n        for i in range(N - 1, 0, -1):\r\n            A[i] = A[i - 1]\r\n        A[0] = tmp\r\n    return A\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, on the following website https://www.martinkysel.com/codility-cyclicrotation-solution/, I have found the following fancy solution to the same problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef reverse(arr, i, j):\r\n    for idx in xrange((j - i + 1) / 2):\r\n        arr[i+idx], arr[j-idx] = arr[j-idx], arr[i+idx]\r\n \r\ndef solution(A, K):\r\n    l = len(A)\r\n    if l == 0:\r\n        return []\r\n         \r\n    K = K%l\r\n     \r\n    reverse(A, l - K, l -1)\r\n    reverse(A, 0, l - K -1)\r\n    reverse(A, 0, l - 1)\r\n \r\n    return A\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould someone explain me how this particular solution works? (The author does not explain it on his website)\r\n\r\nMy solution does not perform quite well for large `A` and `K`, where `K &lt; N`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] * 1000\r\n    K = 1000\r\n    expectedResult = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] * 1000\r\n    res = solution(A, K) # 1455.05908203125 ms = almost 1.4 seconds\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nBecause for `K &lt; N`, my code has a time complexity of `O(N * K)`, where N is the length of the array.\r\nFor large `K` and small `N` (`K &gt; N`), my solution performs well thanks to the modulo operation `K = K % N`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\r\n    K = 999999999999999999999999\r\n    expectedRes = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1]\r\n    res = solution(A, K) # 0.0048828125 ms, because K is torn down to 9 thanks to K = K % N\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other solution, on the other hand, performs greatly in all cases, even when `N &gt; K` and has a complexity of `O(N)`.\r\n\r\nWhat is the logic behind that solution?\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999103/cyclic-rotation-of-array-explanation","title":"Cyclic rotation of array explanation"},{"tags":["python-3.x","tableau","tableau-online"],"owner":{"reputation":288,"user_id":1768610,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2b445417f8cdf66c9290d5a28deda56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1768610","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1768610/user1768610"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568832359,"creation_date":1568832359,"question_id":57999101,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999101","body_markdown":"I am trying to automate Tableau site creation and deletion using python APIs. \r\nhttps://tableau.github.io/server-client-python/docs/\r\n\r\nI am using admin account for this operation.

The goal is to compare Table A to Table and to Table C and pulling back the amounts from both tables to ensure a match.  The part I am struggling with is, Table A has all the accounts that are the base population.  Table B has some and Table C as some.  An account will be in either Table B or C, but never in both. I want to pull the payment from Table A, and then verify to the payment in Table B or C(whichever it occurs) and the same with commission.

I would like to be able to do this in one, so I only have one output.\r\n\r\n```\r\nselect a.account, a.uniq_id, a.pay, b.pay as pay_verf, a.comm, b.comm as comm_verf,\r\nCASE WHEN a.comm = b.comm THEN &#39;MATCHED&#39;\r\n\tELSE &#39;UNMATCHED&#39;\r\n\tEND as Matched\r\n\tfrom tblA a\r\n\tleft join tblB b\r\n\ton a.account = b.account\r\n\tand a.uniq_id = b.uniq_id;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can not just figure out how to also get it to join to Table C without adding an extra column.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999097/join-three-tables-based-on-one-key-putting-data-into-same-column","title":"Join three tables based on one key, putting data into same column"},{"tags":["php","wordpress","thumbnails"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7642,"user_id":533941,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":85,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a8a2d7acbe1f07a03c4109cfe59df646?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Toni Michel Caubet","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/533941/toni-michel-caubet"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568839024,"creation_date":1568839024,"answer_id":58000415,"question_id":57999095,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58000415","body_markdown":"I was able to make it work by prepending `wp_upload_dir()[&#39;path&#39;].&#39;/&#39;` to the `wp_insert_attachment` and to the `wp_generate_attachment_metadata` functions but I wonder if it can be done &quot;better&quot;\r\n\r\n    function attach_image ( $base64, $post_id, $filename ) {\r\n    \r\n    \tif ( empty($base64) ) {\r\n    \t\treturn false;\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n    \t$upload_dir = wp_upload_dir();\r\n    \t$upload_path = str_replace( &#39;/&#39;, DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR, $upload_dir[&#39;path&#39;] ) .

have a form and need to iterate over some elements to get the final sum to put in a &quot;total&quot; element.\r\nE.g., here is a working starter script. It doesn&#39;t NOT iterate over the other ones. It does NOT consider the elements &quot;item*&quot;, below, yet but should. Keep reading.\r\n```\r\n&lt;script&gt;\r\n$( document ).ready(function() {\r\n\t$(&#39;#taxsptotal&#39;).keyup(calcgrand);\r\n\t$(&#39;#shiptotal&#39;).keyup(calcgrand);\r\n\t$(&#39;#disctotal&#39;).keyup(calcgrand);\r\n\t\r\n\tfunction calcgrand() {\r\n\t\tvar grandtot = parseFloat($(&#39;#subtotal&#39;).val(), 10)\r\n\t\t+ parseFloat($(&quot;#taxsptotal&quot;).val(), 10)\r\n\t\t+ parseFloat($(&quot;#shiptotal&quot;).val(), 10)\r\n\t\t- parseFloat($(&quot;#disctotal&quot;).val(), 10)\r\n\r\n\t\t$(&#39;#ordertotal&#39;).val(grandtot);\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n&lt;/script&gt;\r\n```\r\nWe are adding more to this. Think of having many items in a cart and each one has the same elements for the following where &quot;i&quot; is a number designating an individual item.\r\n```\r\n&lt;!-- ordertotal = sum of #subtotal, #taxptotal, #shiptotal and #disctotal --&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;ordertotal&quot; name=&quot;ordertotal&quot; value=&quot;106.49&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;taxsptotal&quot; name=&quot;taxsptotal&quot; value=&quot;6.72&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;shiptotal&quot; name=&quot;shiptotal&quot; value=&quot;15.83&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;disctotal&quot; name=&quot;disctotal&quot; value=&quot;0.00&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- sum of the cart &quot;itemtotal[i]&quot; --&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;subtotal&quot; name=&quot;subtotal&quot; value=&quot;83.94&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- cart items\r\nUser can change any itemprice[i] and/or itemquantity[i]\r\nitemtotal[i] = sum(itemquantity[i] * itemprice[i])\r\n--&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemtotal[1]&quot; value=&quot;8.97&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemquantity[1]&quot; value=&quot;3&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemprice[1]&quot; value=&quot;2.99&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemtotal[2]&quot; value=&quot;4.59&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemquantity[2]&quot; value=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemprice[2]&quot; value=&quot;4.59&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemtotal[3]&quot; value=&quot;0.99&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemquantity[3]&quot; value=&quot;10&quot; /&gt;\r\n&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;itemprice[3]&quot; value=&quot;9.90&quot; /&gt;\r\n```\r\n(1) User can change any itemprice[i] and/or itemquantity[i], so each needs a keyup. I can do that in php as it iterates over the items.\r\n\r\n(2) These elements will have a $(&#39;.itemtotal[i]&#39;).keyup(calcgrand); (Or function other than calcgrand, if needed) statement, too. That keyup can be added by the php code as it evaluates the items in the cart.\r\n\r\n(3) When an element is changed, then the script should automatically (a) calculate the $(&#39;[name=&quot;itemtotal[i]&quot;]&#39;).val() and (b) replace the value for $(&#39;[name=&quot;itemtotal[i]&quot;]&#39;).val().\r\n\r\n(4) Then, the script above will use the $(&#39;[name=&quot;itemtotal[i]&quot;]&#39;).val() to (a) replace the #subtotal value and (b) use that value in the equation.\r\n\r\nCan someone help me with this? I am stuck on how to iterate over the [i] elements.\r\n\r\np.s. Any corrections/enhancements to the above code is appreciated, too.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999091/jquery-javascript-complex-iterate-over-elements","title":"jQuery/Javascript complex iterate over elements"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","memory"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12086720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dfea92b303bb00849cbfb95e9d1c9ed9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ray QUAN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086720/ray-quan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12086720,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dfea92b303bb00849cbfb95e9d1c9ed9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ray QUAN","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12086720/ray-quan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568841956,"creation_date":1568832319,"last_edit_date":1568841956,"question_id":57999090,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57999090","body_markdown":"In some of my application, I evaluate the gradient with a large amount of data.

If so, [this should work](https://regexr.com/4l8co):\r\n\r\n    /^.*\\n.*keyword/mg\r\n\r\nHere:\r\n\r\n1. In multiline mode (enabled with the `m` flag) the caret (`^`) matches the beginning of a line.\r\n\r\n2. `.*` matches zero or more non-newline characters, i.e. the contents of a single line.\r\n\r\n3. `\\n` matches a newline.\r\n\r\n4. `.*keyword` again matches any number of non-newline characters followed by the literal string `keyword`.\r\n\r\nYou can use this regexp in a [search-and-replace operation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace) to insert the newlines like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    let string = `line1\r\n    line2\r\n    keyword\r\n    line3\r\n    line4\r\n    line6\r\n    line7\r\n    keyword\r\n    line8\r\n    line9\r\n    keyword\r\n    line10`;\r\n\r\n    string = string.replace( /^.*\\n.*keyword/gm, &#39;\\n$&amp;&#39; );\r\n    console.log( string );\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNote that the `^` at the beginning isn&#39;t strictly needed, since most regexp engines (including any PCRE-compatible ones) will try to start each match as early as possible, and the earliest place `.*` can start matching something is at the beginning of a line.  But having it there makes the intent clearer, and may also speed up the matching by telling the engine that there&#39;s no point in even trying to start a match in the middle of a line.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the regexp above will not match anything _after_ `keyword` on the second line.  For this particular replacement that doesn&#39;t matter, but if you do want to match the rest of the line, just add another `.*` after `keyword` in the regexp.\r\n\r\nConversely, if you know that the keyword always occurs at the beginning of the line (or if you don&#39;t actually want to match lines where it doesn&#39;t), you can remove the `.*` before `keyword` from the regexp.  Or, if the keyword must occur _alone_ on the line, you can remove the `.*` before `keyword` _and_ add an end-of-line anchor (`$`) after it.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nPs. [as bitinerant notes](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999214), the [online search-and-replace tool](https://onlinetexttools.com/replace-text) you&#39;re using doesn&#39;t support escape sequences like `\\n` in the replacement.  To work around those limitations, you can use the regexp `/^.*(\\n).*keyword/mg` and the replacement string `$1$&amp;`.  Here, the parenthesized subexpression `(\\n)` just matches the newline between the two lines, so that we can use `$1` in the replacement to insert an extra newline without having to somehow enter a literal newline into the replacement field.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57999073/is-there-an-regex-for-finding-the-beging-of-the-line-of-the-previous-line-of-a-t/57999246#57999246","title":"Is there an RegEx for finding

Have you [RTFM][1]? For example, *~/.bashrc* is only read by interactive shells, not shell scripts. And *~/.bash_profile* is only read by login shells. Again, shell scripts don&#39;t usually use the `-l` flag that would make them login shells. Also, if you put an `export VAR=value` statement in your *~/.bashrc* it won&#39;t affect your current interactive shell. You need to start a new shell; e.g., by typing `exec bash`. Once you do that you should find the env var is defined. And it will be inherited by any process, including a shell script, you launch from that interactive session.\r\n\r\nNote that if you run your script via crontab, for example, then you&#39;ll need a different means of setting the env var.

Consult an ISA reference like Intel&#39;s manual, not this book!  https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/idiv\r\n\r\nAlso see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36464879/when-and-why-do-we-sign-extend-and-use-cdq-with-mul-div and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38416593/why-should-edx-be-0-before-using-the-div-instruction/38416896#38416896\r\n\r\nx86-64&#39;s only hardware division instructions are `idiv` and `div`.  64-bit mode removed `aam`, which does 8-bit division by an immediate.  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33109236/dividing-in-assembler-x86/53796650#53796650 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37129794/displaying-time-in-assembly/37131263#37131263 has an example of using `aam` in 16-bit mode).\r\n\r\nOf course for division by constants `idiv` and `div` (and `aam`) are very inefficient.  Use shifts for powers of 2, or a multiplicative inverse otherwise, unless you&#39;re optimizing for code-size instead of performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**CS:APP apparently has multiple serious x86-64 instruction-set mistakes like this, claiming that GCC emits impossible instructions**.  Not just typos or subtle mistakes, but misleading nonsense that&#39;s very obviously wrong to people familiar with the x86-64 instruction set.  It&#39;s not just a syntax mistake, it&#39;s trying to use instructions that aren&#39;t encodeable (no syntax can exist to express them, other than a macro that expands to multiple instructions.  Defining `idivq` as a pseudo-instruction using a macro would be pretty weird).\r\n\r\ne.g. https://stackoverflow.com/q/57772527 is another one where it suggests that `(%rbx, %rdi, %rsi)` and `(%rsi, %rsi, 9)` are valid addressing modes!  The scale factor is actually a 2-bit shift count so these are total garbage and a sign of a serious lack of knowledge by the authors about the ISA they&#39;re teaching, not a typo.\r\n\r\nTheir code won&#39;t assemble with any AT&amp;T syntax assembler.\r\n\r\nAlso https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48304514/what-does-this-x86-64-addq-instruction-mean-which-only-have-one-operand-from is another example, where they have a nonsensical `addq %eax` instead of `inc %rdx`, and a mismatched operand-size in a `mov` store.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n**It seems that they&#39;re just making stuff up and claiming it was emitted by GCC**.  IDK if they start with real GCC output and edit it into what they think is a better example, or actually write it by hand from scratch without testing it.\r\n\r\nGCC&#39;s actual output would have used multiplication by a magic constant (fixed-point multiplicative inverse) to divide by 9 (even at `-O0`, but this is clearly not debug-mode code.  They could have used `-Os`).\r\n\r\nPresumably they didn&#39;t want to talk about https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41183935/why-does-gcc-use-multiplication-by-a-strange-number-in-implementing-integer-divi and replaced that block of code with their made-up instruction.  From context you can probably figure out where they expect the output to go; perhaps they mean `rcx /= 9`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe rest of CSAPP would have to be pretty amazing to make up for these errors and make the textbook worth using.  I&#39;m not familiar with it at all, but I wonder if it used to be good in earlier editions but porting it to x86-64 introduced a lot of errors.  (If older editions were maybe 32-bit x86).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### How a hypothetical `idiv reg, reg` or `idiv $imm, reg` would be designed\r\n\r\n&gt; Also, the dividend should be given from the quantity in registers %rdx (high-order 64 bits) and %rax (low-order 64 bits) - so if this is defined in the architecture then it does not seem possible that the second operand could be a specified dividend.\r\n\r\nIf Intel or AMD *had* introduced a new convenient forms for `div` or `idiv`, **they would have designed it to use a single-width dividend because that&#39;s how compilers always use it.**\r\n\r\nMost languages are like C and implicitly promote both operands for + - * / to the same type and produce a result of that width.  Of course if the inputs are known to be narrow that can be optimized away.  (e.g. using one `imul r32` to implement `a * (int64_t)b`).\r\n\r\nBut `div` and `idiv` fault if the quotient overflows so it&#39;s not safe to use a single 32-bit `idiv` when compiling `int32_t q = (int64_t)a / (int32_t)b`. \r\n\r\nCompilers *always* use `xor edx,edx` before DIV or `cdq` or `cqo` before IDIV to actually do n / n =&gt; n-bit division.  \r\n\r\n\r\nReal full-width division using a dividend that isn&#39;t just zero- or sign-extended is only done by hand with intrinsics or asm (because gcc/clang and other compilers don&#39;t know when the optimization is safe), or in gcc helper functions that do e.g. 64-bit / 64-bit division in 32-bit code.  (Or 128-bit division in 64-bit code).\r\n\r\nSo what would be most helpful is a div/idiv that avoids the extra instruction to set up RDX, too, as well as minimizing the number of implicit register operands.  (Like [`imul r32, r/m32` and `imul r32, r/m32, imm`][1] do: making the common case of non-widening multiplication more convenient with no implicit registers.  That&#39;s Intel-syntax like the manuals, destination first)\r\n\r\nThe simplest way would be a 2-operand instruction that did `dst /= src`.  Or maybe replaced both operands with quotient and remainder.  Using a VEX encoding for 3 operands like [BMI1 `andn`](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/andn), you could maybe have  \r\n`idivx remainder_dst, dividend, divisor`.  With the 2nd operand also an output for the quotient.  Or you could have the remainder written to RDX with a non-destructive destination for the quotient.\r\n\r\nOr more likely to optimize for the simple case where only the quotient is needed, `idivx quot, dividend, divisor` and not store the remainder anywhere.  You can always use regular `idiv` when you want the quotient.\r\n\r\n[BMI2 `mulx`][2] uses an implicit `rdx` input operand because its purpose is to allow multiple dep chains of add-with-carry for extended-precision multiply.  So it still has to produce 2 outputs.  But this hypothetical new form of `idiv` would exist to save code-size and uops around normal uses of `idiv` that *aren&#39;t* widening.  So 186 or 286 `imul reg, reg/mem` is the point of comparison, not BMI2 `mulx`.\r\n\r\nIDK if it would make sense to introduce an immediate form of `idivx` as well; you&#39;d only use it for code-size reasons.  Multiplicative inverses are more efficient division by constants so there&#39;s very little real-world use-case for such an instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/imul\r\n  [2]: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/mulx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998998/csapp-example-uses-idivq-with-two-operands/57999595#57999595","title":"CS:APP example uses idivq with two operands?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570607771,"post_id":58298436,"comment_id":102961752,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998998/csapp-example-uses-idivq-with-two-operands/58298436#comment102961752_58298436"},{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570608102,"post_id":58298436,"comment_id":102961904,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998998/csapp-example-uses-idivq-with-two-operands/58298436#comment102961904_58298436"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12186358,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3d1f8342f4d94737e1564ddf5c20f924?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Robert Marmorstein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12186358/robert-marmorstein"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570603473,"creation_date":1570603473,"answer_id":58298436,"question_id":57998998,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58298436","body_markdown":"Interestingly, gas seems to allow the following:\r\n\r\n    mov $20, %rax\r\n    mov $0, %rdx\r\n    mov $5, %rcx\r\n    idivq %rcx, %rax\r\n    ret\r\n\r\nThis is still performing the one operand division under the hood, but it LOOKS like two-operand form.

It claims that GCC emits `idivq $9, %rcx` when compiling a short C function.\r\n\r\n[![][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs033/docs/guides/x64_cheatsheet.pdf\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Xyxw6.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998998/csapp-example-uses-idivq-with-two-operands","title":"CS:APP example uses idivq with two operands?"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14067,"user_id":3965631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7nII.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Lewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3965631/tim-lewis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568832341,"creation_date":1568832341,"answer_id":57999096,"question_id":57998997,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57999096","body_markdown":"As noted in the comments, `id`s in HTML need to be unique, so using the same value in a loop results in invalid HTML and unexpected results when targeting that id:\r\n\r\n    @foreach ($carteras as $cartera)\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;a href=&quot;&quot; class=&quot;badge-md badge-pill badge-danger&quot; data-toggle=&quot;modal&quot; data-target=&quot;#exampleModalCenter&quot;&gt;Eliminar&lt;/a&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;modal fade&quot; id=&quot;exampleModalCenter&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot; role=&quot;dialog&quot; aria-labelledby=&quot;exampleModalCenterTitle&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n    @endforeach\r\n\r\nTo handle this, simply make the `id`s unique:\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;a ... data-target=&quot;#exampleModalCenter_{{ $cartera-&gt;id }}&quot;&gt;\r\n    ...\r\n    &lt;div ... id=&quot;exampleModalCenter_{{ $cartera-&gt;id }}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998997/registration-is-not-deleted-using-a-confirmation-modality-in-laravel/57999096#57999096","title":"Registration is not deleted using a confirmation modality in laravel"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12007804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCGmPB2fuEQW4cs2wQrRHf2y50TxaCUnYpUx4CU=k-s128","display_name":"JoseFranc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12007804/josefranc"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14067,"user_id":3965631,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/T7nII.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Lewis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3965631/tim-lewis"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57999096,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568832391,"creation_date":1568831923,"last_edit_date":1568832391,"question_id":57998997,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57998997","body_markdown":"I have a table of records that when I click on the delete button in one of those records, a bootstrap 4 modal opens to confirm the action.

That means, this API must exist in your cluster for this configuration to work.\r\n\r\nIf the metric is associated with a Kubernetes object, you would use a `type: Object` and if the metric is from the pods of the pod controller (e.g. Deployment) that you are trying to autoscale, you would use a `type: Pods`. In both cases, the HPA would try to fetch the metric from the [Custom Metrics API](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/custom-metrics-api.md).\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nNote (because it seems that you are trying to use a metric that is not yet in Kubernetes):\r\n\r\nThe HPA can only talk to the metric APIs: [Resource Metrics API][1], [Custom Metrics API][2], [External Metrics API][3].\r\n\r\nIf your metric is not served by one of these APIs, then you have to create a metrics pipeline that brings the metric to one of these APIs.\r\n\r\nFor example, using [Prometheus][4] and the [Prometheus Adapter][5]:\r\n\r\n- Prometheus periodically scrapes the metric from your external web server\r\n- Prometheus Adapter exposes the metric through the External Metrics API\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n_**EDIT:** explain metric APIs._\r\n\r\n_In the diagrams below, the green components are those that you need to install to provide the corresponding metric API._\r\n\r\n### [Resource Metrics API][1]\r\n\r\nServes CPU and memory usage metrics of all Pods and Nodes in the cluster. These are predefined metric (in contrast to the custom metrics of the other two APIs).\r\n\r\nThe raw data for the metrics is collected by [cAdvisor][6] which runs as part of the kubelet on each node. The metrics are exposed by the [Metrics Server][7].\r\n\r\nThe Metrics Server implements the Resource Metrics API. It is not installed by default in Kubernetes. That means, to enable the Resource Metrics API in your cluster, you have to install the Metrics Server.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][8]][8]\r\n\r\n### [Custom Metrics API][2]\r\n\r\nServes custom metrics that are associated with Kubernetes objects. The metrics can be anything you want.\r\n\r\nYou are responsible yourself for collecting the metrics that you want to expose through the Custom Metrics API. You do this by installing a &quot;metrics pipeline&quot; in the cluster.\r\n\r\nYou can choose the components for your metrics pipeline yourself. The only requirement is that the metrics pipeline is able to:\r\n\r\n1. Collect metrics\r\n2. Implement the Custom Metrics API\r\n\r\nA popular choice for a metrics pipeline is to use [Prometheus][4] and the [Prometheus Adapter][5]:\r\n\r\n- Prometheus collects metrics (any metrics you want)\r\n- Prometheus Adapter implements the Custom Metrics API and exposes the metrics collected by Prometheus through the Custom Metrics API\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][9]][9]\r\n\r\n### [External Metrics API][3]\r\n\r\nServes custom metrics that are not associated with Kubernetes objects.\r\n\r\nThe External Metrics API works identical to the Custom Metrics API. The only difference is that it has different API paths (that don&#39;t include objects, but only metric names).\r\n\r\nTo provide the External Metrics API you can, in most cases, use the same metrics pipeline as for the Custom Metrics API (e.g. Prometheus and the Prometheus Adapter).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][10]][10]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

with the result.  `SUM()` ignores `NULL` values, so if all non-`NULL` values will be added together.  However, `+` does not ignore `NULL` values.  If *either* operand is `NULL`, then the result is `NULL`.\r\n\r\nIf, for instance, you have a name where all the `decrease` values are `NULL`.

I&#39;m using a SUM of 2 columns.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll try and break it down to the simplest key components of the system.\r\n\r\n    Ledger:  \r\n    | increase | decrease | userid | currency\r\n    \r\n    Users:  \r\n    | email | role |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n`userid` is FK to `id` on users table, there are no orphan rows.\r\n\r\n**And now for the query:**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT \r\n  SUM(l.increase) - SUM(l.decrease) as total\r\nFROM ledger l \r\nJOIN users u ON l.userid = u.id AND u.role = &#39;customer&#39;\r\nWHERE l.currency = &#39;USD&#39;\r\nGROUP BY u.email\r\nORDER BY total DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above yields a 145 rows of users. I can put it in a sub query to get what I believe is the true SUM\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT SUM(tmp.total) FROM (&lt;ABOVE_AS_SUBQUERY&gt;) as tmp\r\n```\r\n\r\nand **I get 8042**.\r\n\r\n**Here&#39;s my second query:**\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT \r\n  SUM(l.increase) - SUM(l.decrease) as total\r\nFROM ledger l \r\nJOIN users u ON l.userid = u.id AND u.role = &#39;customer&#39;\r\nWHERE l.currency = &#39;USD&#39;\r\nGROUP BY u.role\r\nORDER BY total DESC\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis time I&#39;ve grouped by role, in-fact, I can remove the GROUP BY all-together and it behaves the same.  **I get 99104**.\r\n\r\nSurely the results should be the same. Especially as my join condition is already filtering `role=&#39;customer&#39;`.\r\n\r\n`GROUP BY u.email` gives me a set of totals unique to each email, but I don&#39;t understand why removing the GROUP by gives me a number so far beyond what&#39;s in the data-set after a GROUP BY that something weird is clearly happening. Why is the resulting row not just the SUM of all those emails and giving me 8042?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here is a [SQL Fiddle][1]. The 2 queries return the same result, as I would have originally expected. I cannot replicate this problem in this fiddle meaning it is related to the data, but there&#39;s only 2 tables at play here. What sort of data can I use to replicate what I am describing?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!9/a9ed15/2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57998980/sql-sum-and-group-by","title":"SQL SUM and GROUP BY"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":7159}
