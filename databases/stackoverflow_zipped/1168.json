I&#39;ve tested with JS, C#, and Python generator but all of them were not stable enough. The _stable_ means, you might have an eternal loop during parsing in non-java ones.\r\n\r\nOf course, you can parse `C#` file with the Java ANTLR runtime. To generate lexer/parser files, please walkthrough [the tutorial](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/getting-started.md#windows). The generated results are plain `.java` files, so you should create your own jar library file from them.\r\n\r\nI agree that the entire process is not one-click-solves-all, but language treatment is always dirty.\r\n\r\nTo invoke `jar` in WinForm, you can use [IKVM](https://www.nuget.org/packages/IKVM/8.1.5717) nuget package in order to convert `jar` to `dll` as below, and then add the `dll` into a WinForm project.\r\n\r\n    C:\\ikvmc.exe -target:library csharp-lexer-parser.jar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264499/how-to-create-lexer-parser/58265891#58265891","title":"How to create Lexer/Parser?"}],"owner":{"reputation":190,"user_id":10530657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/579795355ca191f27fdeff4ebc208e44?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"eusataf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10530657/eusataf"},"last_editor":{"reputation":190,"user_id":10530657,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/579795355ca191f27fdeff4ebc208e44?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"eusataf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10530657/eusataf"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570607877,"creation_date":1570430229,"last_edit_date":1570442260,"question_id":58264499,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264499","body_markdown":"Used:  \r\nVisual Studio - 2019\r\n  \r\nTo install `ANTLR` I use - [tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs // Github.com](https://github.com/tunnelvisionlabs/antlr4cs)     \r\n\r\nI took the grammar here - [antlr/grammars-v4 // Github.com](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/master/csharp)  \r\nGrammar:  \r\n - CSharpLexer.g4;      \r\n - CSharpParser.g4;    \r\n - CSharpPreprocessorParser.g4;    \r\n    \r\nI did:  \r\n1.

I achieve this with `jquery`.\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;base.js&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n```\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n  $(&#39;.nav-link&#39;).css(&#39;color&#39;, &#39;#F2B705&#39;)\r\n})\r\n\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n    var scroll_pos = 0;\r\n    $(document).scroll(function() {\r\n        scroll_pos = $(this).scrollTop();\r\n        if(scroll_pos &lt; 80) {\r\n          $(&quot;.navbar&quot;).css(&#39;background&#39;, &#39;transparent&#39;);\r\n          $(&#39;.nav-link&#39;).css(&#39;color&#39;, &#39;#F2B705&#39;)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if(scroll_pos &gt; 100) {\r\n            $(&quot;.navbar&quot;).css(&#39;background&#39;, &#39;linear-gradient(to right, #ffb347, #ffcc33)&#39;);\r\n            $(&#39;.nav-link&#39;).css(&#39;color&#39;, &#39;#141259&#39;)\r\n        }\r\n    });\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem I am facing is when I inherit the base template in other pages, I want the `jquery` to also work on all pages. I am able to view the navbar itself in all the pages but for some weird reason, the `base.js jquery` code only works in the `index.html` template and not in the other templates. Below is the code for `index.html` and `contact.html`\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;index.html&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n```\r\n{% extends &#39;base.html&#39; %}\r\n{% load staticfiles %}\r\n\r\n{% block title %}Home{% endblock title %}\r\n\r\n{% block header %}\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- index.css --&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{% static &#39;css/index.css&#39; %}&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;!-- index.js --&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;{% static &#39;js/index.js&#39; %}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n{% endblock header %}\r\n\r\n{% block content %}\r\n...\r\n{% endblock content %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;h1&gt;contact.html&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n```\r\n{% extends &#39;base.html&#39; %}\r\n{% load staticfiles %}\r\n\r\n{% block title %}Contact Us{% endblock title %}\r\n\r\n{% block header %}\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- contact.css --&gt;\r\n&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;{% static &#39;css/contact.css&#39; %}&quot;&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- contact.js --&gt;\r\n&lt;script src=&quot;{% static &#39;js/contact.js&#39; %}&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n{% endblock header %}\r\n\r\n{% block content %}\r\n...\r\n{% endblock content %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe CDNs for bootstrap and jquery is given only inside the base template. I tried adding the CDNs to the other templates as well, but that does not work.

you want to save an array you can&#39;t just save it as text and expect python to figure it out. When you read it, you&#39;re reading it as text (as a string) and that&#39;s all your program can know.\r\n\r\nIf you want to save complex objects you have several other options:\r\n\r\n1. You can save text (as you do) but parse it manually when reading it to turn it into an array. This is complex to write without bugs and will get even more complex if you have anything even more complex than an array.\r\n2. You can save it using [pickle][1] - while this is a good solution for almost all objects, the file created wouldn&#39;t be readable to humans, and that&#39;s perhaps not what you want.\r\n3. A good middle ground is to save objects as [JSON][2] - this is a standard for most datatypes and would work beautifully for dicts and lists and tuples (but will fail with more complex objects), and more importantly, it will be readable to humans such as yourself.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s say you go with JSON. You save a list like this:\r\n\r\n    import json\r\n    with open(&#39;save.txt&#39;,&#39;w&#39;) as f:\r\n        json.dump(your_object, f)\r\n\r\nAs simple as that. To read back the list:\r\n\r\n    import json\r\n    with open(&#39;save.txt&#39;,&#39;r&#39;) as f:\r\n        your_new_object = json.load(f)\r\n\r\nThis is fairly simple isn&#39;t it? Notice I used a `with` statement to open the files to make sure they close properly as well, but that&#39;s also more simple to write. Using pickles is fairly similar and even has the same syntax, but objects are saved as bytes and not text (so you have to use `&#39;rb&#39;` and `&#39;wb&#39;` modes on files to read and write, respectively).\r\n\r\nTo do the same thing with numpy array, we can also use [numpy.save][3]:\r\n\r\n    np.save(&#39;save&#39;, your_numpy_array)\r\n\r\nAnd we read it back (with a `npy` extension) with [numpy.load][4]:\r\n\r\n    your_array = np.load(&#39;save.npy&#39;)\r\n\r\nIn readability terms, opening the file would be semi-readable (less than JSON, more than pickle)\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.save.html\r\n  [4]: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.load.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264409/writing-files-reading-them-and-call-them-with-different-moduls/58264542#58264542","title":"writing files, reading them and call them with different moduls"}],"owner":{"reputation":96,"user_id":9998989,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c594ed699a93005ce5fe0a93d91b8106?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Noob Programmer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9998989/noob-programmer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":96,"user_id":9998989,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c594ed699a93005ce5fe0a93d91b8106?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Noob Programmer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9998989/noob-programmer"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58264542,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570431129,"creation_date":1570429606,"last_edit_date":1570430304,"question_id":58264409,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264409","body_markdown":"I am trying to save variables after I run a program to a text file and read them in different module, to call them back in the original program.

am adding another answer as the original question was modified significantly. it looks to me that you are over-complicating a matter which is rather simple if you understand it.\r\n\r\nBefore i explain further, i think your approach with setting the &quot;.RowSource&quot; with the &quot;.address&quot; property of a range is incorrect because the address property does not contain a reference of the parent sheet so it will always refer to the active sheet even if you have gotten that address from a global wb range. see below:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\ni hope the below would be helpful to you to achieve what you want.

It works fine if I put back in the worksheet.activate call but otherwise it references a range in the wrong sheet (the active one).\r\n\r\n        Sub UserForm_Initialize()\r\n       &#39; Application.ScreenUpdating = False\r\n        \r\n        Dim r1 As Long, c1 As Long, r2 As Long, c2 As Long, rng1 As Range, rng2 As Range, s As Worksheet, initSheet As Worksheet\r\n        \r\n        Set s = Sheets(&quot;NamePlates&quot;)\r\n        Set rng1 = s.Range(&quot;MasterStoreNamePlates&quot;)\r\n        Set initSheet = Application.ActiveSheet\r\n        \r\n        r1 = rng1.Row\r\n        c1 = rng1.Column\r\n        r2 = r1 + storeCount - 1\r\n        c2 = c1\r\n        \r\n        &#39;s.Activate\r\n        With s\r\n            listBoxStores.RowSource = .Range(.Cells(r1, c1), .Cells(r2, c2)).Address\r\n        End With\r\n        &#39;initSheet.Activate\r\n    \r\n       &#39; Application.ScreenUpdating = True\r\n    \r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not too demanding to switch to a different sheet for a quick range lookup, but come on... what&#39;s the point of naming the ranges and making the name global and all the posts about &quot;make sure to set the name to global&quot; if I have to still go and switch the active sheet?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nAn update:\r\n\r\n    Sub UserForm_Initialize()\r\n    \r\n        Application.ScreenUpdating = False\r\n        \r\n        Dim rng1 As Range, rng2 As Range, sInd As Long, initSheet As Worksheet, s As Worksheet\r\n        \r\n        sInd = Sheets(&quot;NamePlates&quot;).index\r\n        Set s = Sheets(sInd)\r\n        Set rng1 = s.Range(&quot;NamePlates!MasterStoreNamePlates&quot;)\r\n        Set initSheet = Application.ActiveSheet\r\n            \r\n           listBoxStores.RowSource = rng1.Range(s.Cells(1, 1), s.Cells(storeCount - 1, 1)).Address\r\n    \r\n        Application.ScreenUpdating = True\r\n\r\n    End Sub\r\n\r\nDoesn&#39;t provide any different result.  It still accesses the active sheet.  If I change the active sheet before doing this, it retrieves the right data, otherwise it pulls the range from the active sheet.\r\n\r\nI noticed that `s.Range(&quot;NamePlates!MasterStoreNamePlates&quot;)` does get me the correct range... but then when I use that range and do something relative to it, I lose the sheet reference.  So I think maybe my solution will involve dynamically updating the named range and then this method should work.  Currently you can see that I&#39;m using that constant `&quot;storeCount&quot;` which is not really a very good way to do things.  It is just kind of my hack for getting things up and running.  All the other suggested methods fail in my case for the same reason; even if they make a good reference to the correct range, I loose that sheet reference when I start doing anything that defines the range I want, which is 12 rows longer than the named range (thus the `&quot;storeCount&quot;` constant).\r\n\r\nIf I can&#39;t figure out how to do a dynamically changing named range I&#39;ll post a new question but I&#39;ve seen some things about that so I should be able to get that working and I&#39;ll post my solution here... or if someone beats me to it I&#39;ll accept that answer even though it&#39;s a little different from the OP.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264408/how-to-reference-named-range-in-vba-from-an-inactive-sheet","title":"How to reference named range in VBA from an inactive sheet?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","datetime"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12157233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WDJg3NQejMA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdJx4Qh5zcIs4drZKRiUpn2d-1tPQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gayan Lankeshwara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157233/gayan-lankeshwara"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570430486,"post_id":58264406,"comment_id":102896953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264406/how-can-i-merge-the-columns-together-and-convert-them-into-datetime-format#comment102896953_58264406"},{"owner":{"reputation":423560,"user_id":2901002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMDvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jezrael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2901002/jezrael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570432860,"post_id":58264406,"comment_id":102897783,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264406/how-can-i-merge-the-columns-together-and-convert-them-into-datetime-format#comment102897783_58264406"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12157233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WDJg3NQejMA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdJx4Qh5zcIs4drZKRiUpn2d-1tPQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gayan Lankeshwara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157233/gayan-lankeshwara"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12157233,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WDJg3NQejMA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdJx4Qh5zcIs4drZKRiUpn2d-1tPQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Gayan Lankeshwara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12157233/gayan-lankeshwara"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570429712,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570432771,"creation_date":1570429595,"last_edit_date":1570432771,"question_id":58264406,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264406","body_markdown":"I have the following data set and want to merge the Date, Hour and Minute columns together and convert it to Datetime format.

So when you run the python script using &quot;`sudo python script.py`&quot; you get the module not found error as the path variables for openvino are not rightly set for sudo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you open the setupvars.sh you can see all path variable are set without sudo like the below example\r\n\r\n    export PATH=~/intel/openvino_2019.2.242/python/python3.7:$PATH\r\n**\r\n\r\nResolution\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**\r\nTo resolve your error you can use any of the two below alternatives:\r\n\r\n1)You can run &quot;`python script.py`&quot; which could give you your expected result.\r\n\r\n\r\n2)If you want to get this packages in &quot;`sudo python script.py`&quot; you must add openvino path to the sudo path. This can be done by editing the setupvars.sh file by changing the commands used to set paths as in the below example\r\n\r\neg:\r\n\r\n    export PATH=~/intel/openvino_2019.2.242/python/python3.7:$PATH\r\n\r\nshould be replaced with\r\n\r\n    sudo

For an Arduino This is 32 bits, 4 bytes, of data. I&#39;m not sure exactly what `wire.write` does because the documentation I can find is substandard to the point of being garbage, but [the documentation][1] looks like it&#39;s going to send exactly 1 of the 4 bytes you wanted to send. In order to send more than one byte, it looks like you need to use the array version: `Wire.write(&amp;distance, sizeof (distance));`, but even this may not be sufficient. I&#39;ll get back into that later.\r\n\r\n    Wire.write(&quot;Why No Work?&quot;);\r\n\r\nwrites a null-terminated string (specifically a `const char[13]`) onto the I2C bus. I don&#39;t know arduino well enough to know if this also sends the terminating null.\r\n\r\nso\r\n\r\n    Wire.write(distance);\r\n    Wire.write(&quot;Why No Work?&quot;);\r\n    Wire.write(distance);\r\n\r\nneeded to write at least 4 + 12 + 4 bytes onto the I2C bus. and probably only wrote 1 + 12 + 1. \r\n\r\nOn the Pi side, \r\n\r\n    read(file,buf, 3);\r\n\r\nread out 3 bytes. This isn&#39;t enough to get the whole of `distance`, let alone the array of characters and second write of `distance`. You need to read all of the data you wrote, at least 20 bytes. \r\n\r\nIn addition, \r\n\r\n    char buf[0];\r\n\r\ndefines an array of 0 length. There isn&#39;t much you can do with it as there is no space to store anything here. It cannot hold 3 characters, let alone the 20 or 21 necessary. `read` of 3 bytes wrote into invalid memory and the program [can no longer be counted on for sane results][2]. \r\n\r\nThis means that at best\r\n\r\n        float distance= (int) buf[0];\r\n        dd= buf[1];\r\n        float dist=(int) buf[2];\r\n\r\ngot only one byte of the four bytes of `distance` and it&#39;s dumb luck that the result was the same as expected. `dd` got exactly one character, not the whole string, and this is turning out to be nonsense because of one of the preceding mistakes. `dist` is similarly garbage. \r\n\r\nTo successfully move data from one machine to another, you need to establish a communication protocol. You can&#39;t just write a `long` onto a wire. `long` doesn&#39;t have the same size on all platforms, nor does it always have the [same encoding][3]. You have to make absolutely certain that both sides agree on how the `long` is to be written (size  and byte order) and read.\r\n\r\nExactly how you are going to do this is up to you, but [here are some pointers][4] and a search term, **serialization**, to assist you in further research.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/WireWrite\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior\r\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness\r\n  [4]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1810235/4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264374/i-want-to-receive-multiple-data-from-arduino-to-raspberry-pi-using-i2c/58264824#58264824","title":"I want to receive multiple data from arduino to raspberry pi using I2C"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12150351,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-80N66H-yU7o/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rcZr6zg5a9RbLP1pcfG8n2HeTa9-w/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Jason Ju","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12150351/jason-ju"},"last_editor":{"reputation":23537,"user_id":4581301,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e5580eebb22e2c65c9b2325d2276d92a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user4581301","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4581301/user4581301"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570462973,"creation_date":1570429362,"last_edit_date":1570429620,"question_id":58264374,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264374","body_markdown":"Thank you to whoever is kind enough to look into this question.\r\n\r\nI want to receive multiple data from arduino to raspberry pi using I2C.\r\n\r\nI can obtain 1 data from arduino, but once I move to more than one data, it fails to do so.\r\n\r\nI have tried multiple methods so far, and I found this method to work the best to obtain data from Arduino.\r\n\r\nMy previous attempt in obtaining data from arduino is as follows:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58254685/i-want-to-read-from-arduino-using-i2c-using-raspberry-pi\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/58255579/raspberry-pis-terminal-response-has-weird-font-that-cannot-be-recognized\r\n\r\nWhich are all solved by now.\r\nGot Massive Help from link below\r\nhttps://area-51.blog/2014/02/15/connecting-an-arduino-to-a-raspberry-pi-using-i2c/\r\n\r\nArduino Code\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;Wire.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    #define echoPin 7\r\n    #define trigPin 8\r\n    \r\n    int number=0;\r\n    long duration;\r\n    long distance;\r\n    \r\n    void setup()\r\n    {\r\n      //Join I2C bus as slave with address 8\r\n      Wire.begin(8);\r\n      \r\n      //Call SendData &amp;

but yesterday i upgrade to .net core 3.0 and now i must send json string, and doesn&#39;t accept simple object.\r\n\r\nIndeed. I could reproduce the same issue as yours. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a bug because ASP.NET Core 3.0 now uses `System.Text.Json` as the default tool to serialize/deserialize json. See [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio#jsonnet-support).\r\n\r\nHowever, according to [json.org](http://json.org/), the string should start with `&quot;` instead of `&#39;`. :\r\n\r\n![JSON string](https://www.json.org/img/string.png)\r\n\r\nIn short, **the way you did in old days is not a standard JSON representation**. The reason why you can do that is [JSON.NET](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) does it for you automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nTo enable the old behavior, you could follow [Microsoft&#39;s advice here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/migration/22-to-30?view=aspnetcore-3.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio#jsonnet-support):\r\n\r\n1. Add a package reference to [JSON.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson) \r\n2. Add `.AddNewtonsoftJson()` for MVC:\r\n   ```csharp\r\n    public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)\r\n    {\r\n        services.AddControllersWithViews().AddNewtonsoftJson();\r\n    }\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264372/difference-post-structure-in-net-core-2-2-and-3-0/58266433#58266433","title":"difference post structure in .net core 2.2 and 3.0"}],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11254207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RWEWq9IFOFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc2pEYzvsftM8X3vp2yOncXDsF2dg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mohammad adibi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11254207/mohammad-adibi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":30,"user_id":11254207,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RWEWq9IFOFs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rc2pEYzvsftM8X3vp2yOncXDsF2dg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"mohammad adibi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11254207/mohammad-adibi"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":62,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58266433,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1570439110,"creation_date":1570429350,"last_edit_date":1570430374,"question_id":58264372,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264372","body_markdown":"in my project with .net core 2.2 i use postman to test APIs.  \r\nin postman   \r\n(1) set content-type: application/json  \r\n(2) body =&gt; raw &amp; json\r\nand i send simple JavaScript object like this:\r\n\r\n    {\r\n    \tpageSize : 10,\r\n    \tpageNumber : 0,\r\n    \tsortType : &#39;nn&#39;,\r\n    \tkeyword : &#39;ff&#39;,\r\n    \tcityCode : 1,\r\n    \tcitySlug : &#39;f&#39;,\r\n    \tpriceRange : &#39;ff&#39;,\r\n    \tstarRange : &#39;fff&#39;,\r\n    \thotelFacilityRange : &#39;fffff&#39;,\r\n    \troomFacilityRange : &#39;fs&#39;,\r\n    \thotelGroup : &#39;dss&#39;,\r\n    \thotelType : &#39;sss&#39;,\r\n    \tfoodType : &#39;ss&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nbut yesterday i upgrade to .net core 3.0  \r\nand now i must send json string, and doesn&#39;t accept simple object.  \r\nwhat is wrong?  \r\nwhen i send simple object i get null in api, but when i convert to json &quot;pageSize&quot; : 10, &quot;pageNumber&quot;: 0 ... it works!!!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264372/difference-post-structure-in-net-core-2-2-and-3-0","title":"difference post structure in .net core 2.2 and 3.0"},{"tags":["xamarin","xamarin.forms","xamarin.ios","aot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4430,"user_id":10539446,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7VK28.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jack Hua -

You won’t actually be drawing a bar chart, but instead will print out the size of each bin.\r\n        \r\nYour program should take four command line arguments:\r\n    \r\n1. The name of a file containing an `array` of `integers`\r\n2. An integer `b` giving the number of `bins` to sort into.\r\n3. A integer `min` giving the lowest number in the smallest `bin`.\r\n4. An integer `s` giving the size (number of **distinct** integers) in each `bin`. You can assume (without checking) that `b &gt; 0 and s &gt; 0`.\r\n    \r\nDivide the range of values of interest into b bins of size s. Count the number of values from the file that fall into each bin. Also count the number of values that are completely below or above the range.\r\n        \r\nFor example, given this test file `data1:&quot;05X/data1&quot;`\r\n\r\n        1 15\r\n        2 18 11 -101 51 92 53 45 55 52 53 54 55 56 5 -2\r\n        \r\nThe output of `java Example data1 10 -10 7` should be\r\n\r\n        x &lt; -10: 1\r\n        -10 &lt;= x &lt; -3: 0\r\n        -3 &lt;= x &lt; 4: 1\r\n        4 &lt;= x &lt; 11: 1\r\n        11 &lt;= x &lt; 18: 1\r\n        18 &lt;= x &lt; 25: 1\r\n        25 &lt;= x &lt; 32: 0\r\n        32 &lt;= x &lt; 39: 0\r\n        39 &lt;= x &lt; 46: 1\r\n        46 &lt;= x &lt; 53: 2\r\n        53 &lt;= x &lt; 60: 6\r\n        x &gt;= 60: 1\r\n            \r\nMy code below is able to print out the first line of the output.

(If you put it in a loop to read videos, it will\r\n&gt; display the video frame-by-frame)\r\n\r\nIn `cv2.waitKey(X)` function `X` means the number of milliseconds for an image to be displayed on the screen. In your case it is set to 1, so theoretically you are able to achieve 1000 fps (frames per seconds). But frame decoding takes time in `VideoCapture` object and limits your framerate. To change the playback speed you need to declare variable and use it as a parameter in `waitKey` function.\r\n\r\n    import cv2\r\n    \r\n    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(&#39;video.mp4&#39;)\r\n    frameTime = 10 # time of each frame in ms, you can add logic to change this value.\r\n    while(cap.isOpened()):\r\n        ret, frame = cap.read()\r\n        cv2.imshow(&#39;frame&#39;,frame)\r\n        if cv2.waitKey(frameTime) &amp; 0xFF == ord(&#39;q&#39;):\r\n            break\r\n    cap.release()\r\n    cv2.destroyAllWindows()\r\n\r\n\r\nAlternatively, as frame decoding is the most time consuming task you can move it to the second thread and use a queue of decoded frames. See this [link][2] for details. \r\n\r\nThe third approach is to separate grabbing and decoding process and simply decode every nth frame. That will result in displaying only a subset of frames from the source video but from the user perspective the video will be played faster.\r\n\r\n    import cv2\r\n        \r\n    cap = cv2.VideoCapture(&#39;video.mp4&#39;)\r\n    i=0 #frame counter\r\n    frameTime = 1 # time of each frame in ms, you can add logic to change this value.\r\n    while(cap.isOpened()):\r\n        ret = cap.grab() #grab frame\r\n        i=i+1 #increment counter\r\n        if i % 3 == 0: # display only one third of the frames, you can change this parameter according to your needs\r\n            ret, frame = cap.retrieve() #decode frame\r\n            cv2.imshow(&#39;frame&#39;,frame)\r\n            if cv2.waitKey(frameTime) &amp; 0xFF == ord(&#39;q&#39;):\r\n                break\r\n    cap.release()\r\n    cv2.destroyAllWindows()\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/modules/highgui/doc/user_interface.html?highlight=waitkey\r\n  [2]: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/02/06/faster-video-file-fps-with-cv2-videocapture-and-opencv/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264325/python-opencv-control-increase-decrease-the-video-playback-speed-as-custom/58267261#58267261","title":"Python Opencv control (increase/decrease) the video playback speed as custom"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12113772,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/85eb47fdccebeabb775ec509a039d865?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vishal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12113772/vishal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2059,"user_id":4479165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4fb7faf1344075e6252156358b64e539?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theduck","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4479165/theduck"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58267261,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570685810,"creation_date":1570428976,"last_edit_date":1570435026,"question_id":58264325,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264325","body_markdown":"I&#39;m writing a program to control the video playback speed as custom rate.\r\n\r\nIs there is anyway to achieve that?\r\n\r\nWhat code should be added to control the playback speed?\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport cv2\r\n\r\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture(&#39;video.mp4&#39;)\r\n\r\nwhile(cap.isOpened()):\r\n    ret, frame = cap.read()\r\n    cv2.imshow(&#39;frame&#39;,frame)\r\n    if cv2.waitKey(1) &amp;

this is a large piece of code so I will try to simplify it for the sake of this question. I have a Kivy Language script which has a root widget, with an action bar and boxlayout. The code&#39;s general structure goes a bit like this (I do not believe this is required for answering this question but here it is anyway): `Root &gt; MenuBarWidg &gt; BoxLayout &gt; Image + Other buttons/labels...`.\r\n\r\nNow, here is what my widget looks like in kivy (for the boxlayout):\r\n```kivy\r\n&lt;DisplayPhoto&gt;:\r\n    Image:\r\n        id: image_display\r\n        allow_strech: True\r\n        #StringProperty in the class\r\n        source: root.image_path\r\n\r\n    Button:\r\n```\r\nInside my python script:\r\n```python\r\nclass DisplayPhoto(BoxLayout):\r\n    image_path = StringProperty()\r\n    def __init__(self, **kwargs):\r\n        super(DisplayPhoto, self).__init__(self)\r\n        self.image_path = &#39;reload.png&#39;\r\n\r\n    #this is called from another class on a button press\r\n    def update(self):\r\n        self.image_path = &#39;new_image_path.png&#39;\r\n```\r\nUpon calling update in the python script, nothing happens. I have tried `print(self.image_path)` which displays `new_image_path.png`, but it is also a string - not a kivy object. \r\n\r\n\r\nI have tried things such as updating the `source` by calling the `id` etc but got nowhere with that. Any help is appreciated!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264316/how-do-i-easily-and-cleanly-update-an-image-in-kivy-widget-from-python","title":"How do I easily and cleanly update an

believe [this article][1] by Stephen Toub can shed some light on this. In particular, this is a relevant passage about what happens during a context switch:\r\n\r\n&gt; Whenever code awaits an awaitable whose awaiter says it’s not yet complete (i.e. the awaiter’s IsCompleted returns false), the method needs to suspend, and it’ll resume via a continuation off of the awaiter.  This is one of those asynchronous points I referred to earlier, and thus, ExecutionContext needs to flow from the code issuing the await through to the continuation delegate’s execution.  That’s handled automatically by the Framework.  When the async method is about to suspend, the infrastructure captures an ExecutionContext.  The delegate that gets passed to the awaiter has a reference to this ExecutionContext instance and will use it when resuming the method.  This is what enables the important “ambient” information represented by ExecutionContext to flow across awaits.\r\n\r\nWorth noting that the `YieldAwaitable` returned by `Task.Yield()` always returns `false`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58264302/asynchronous-code-shared-variables-thread-pool-threads-and-thread-safety/58441688#58441688","title":"Asynchronous code, shared variables, thread-pool threads and thread safety"}],"owner":{"reputation":3304,"user_id":11178549,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/jloxR.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Theodor Zoulias","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11178549/theodor-zoulias"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":233,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":8,"answer_count":2,"score":8,"last_activity_date":1571352731,"creation_date":1570428807,"question_id":58264302,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58264302","body_markdown":"When I write asynchronous code with async/await, usually with [`ConfigureAwait(false)`][1] to avoid capturing the context, my code is jumping\r\nfrom one thread-pool thread to the next after each `await`.
