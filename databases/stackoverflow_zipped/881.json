I am completely impartial to how this is done - so if there is a better approach, please share it with me. My current *working* method involves using the `open()` method which opens a file in a new document, then duplicate the layer of the new document into the original document. An example of this can be seen below.\r\n```\r\n// open new document\r\nvar originalDoc = app.activeDocument;\r\nvar doc = open( new File( filePath ) );\r\n\r\n// duplicate to original document\r\nvar layer = doc.activeLayer;\r\nvar newLayer = layer.duplicate(originalDoc, ElementPlacement.PLACEATBEGINNING);\r\n\r\n// close new document\r\ndoc.close(SaveOptions.DONOTSAVECHANGES);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis method is extraordinarily slow, especially for large images. After doing some Googling I discovered that Photoshop has a [built-in method for creating an image stack](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/image-stacks.html#creating_an_image_stack). This feature uses a .jsx script itself and it can be [found on GitHub](https://github.com/LeZuse/photoshop-scripts/blob/master/default/Load%20Files%20into%20Stack.jsx). Looking around online I found a few people trying to [load a folders contents as layers](https://community.adobe.com/t5/Photoshop/Load-files-into-Stack-automated-action/td-p/10476232), perfect. The main code I was interested in is below.\r\n```\r\nvar folder = new Folder(&#39;~/Desktop/MyFolder&#39;);\r\nfunction runLoadStack(folderPath) {\r\n    var loadLayersFromScript = true;\r\n    // @include &#39;Load Files into Stack.jsx&#39;\r\n    var fList = folder.getFiles(&#39;*.png&#39;)\r\n    var aFlag = true;\r\n    loadLayers.intoStack(fList, aFlag);\r\n}\r\nrunLoadStack(folder)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI immediately noticed the `@include` method of importing the stack methods, I can not find any official documentation for this (also not friendly with minification). Also, if the script is not placed with the same directory as `Load Files into Stack.jsx` it will throw the error `Unable to open file: anonymous`. And even after solving all of these issues when I run the .jsx script from within my extension using `$.evalFile()` I am having the same error as if the script is not in the correct directory: `Unable to open file: anonymous`. [Error is being thrown on line 762 of an imported jsx](https://github.com/LeZuse/photoshop-scripts/blob/master/default/Stack%20Scripts%20Only/CreateImageStack.jsx#L762).\r\n\r\nAny help resolving the error I am experiencing or simply on how to load an array of image paths into layers (faster method) will be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nHere is the code I am using within my extension:\r\n```\r\nvar loadLayersFromScript = true;\r\nvar strPresets = localize(&quot;$$$/ApplicationPresetsFolder/Presets=Presets&quot;);\r\nvar strScripts = localize(&quot;$$$/PSBI/Automate/ImageProcessor/Photoshop/Scripts=Scripts&quot;);\r\n\r\nvar jsxFilePath = app.path + &quot;/&quot; + strPresets + &quot;/&quot; + strScripts + &quot;/Load Files into Stack.jsx&quot;;\r\n\r\n$.evalFile( new File( jsxFilePath ) );\r\nloadLayers.intoStack( new Folder(&quot;/c/Users/Me/teststack&quot;).getFiles(), true );","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332689/open-a-directory-of-images-into-separate-layers-using-adobe-extension","title":"Open a directory of images into separate layers using Adobe extension"},{"tags":["python","tensorflow","deep-learning","conv-neural-network","object-detection"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571073859,"post_id":58332687,"comment_id":103111112,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332687/how-does-tf-know-what-object-you-are-finetuning-for#comment103111112_58332687"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12068610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/caf4d141c40f9e87df56f64a83fed836?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068610/michael"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571083921,"post_id":58332687,"comment_id":103114966,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332687/how-does-tf-know-what-object-you-are-finetuning-for#comment103114966_58332687"},{"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571155262,"post_id":58332687,"comment_id":103142683,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332687/how-does-tf-know-what-object-you-are-finetuning-for#comment103142683_58332687"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12068610,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/caf4d141c40f9e87df56f64a83fed836?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12068610/michael"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571018237,"post_id":58345624,"comment_id":103088543,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332687/how-does-tf-know-what-object-you-are-finetuning-for/58345624#comment103088543_58345624"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53834,"user_id":4785185,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ChR5h.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Prune","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4785185/prune"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570813165,"creation_date":1570813165,"answer_id":58345624,"question_id":58332687,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58345624","body_markdown":"The model works with the category labels (numbers) you give it.

So clearly the problem is somewhere in JavaScript.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332682/google-analytics-content-grouping-not-working-using-gtag-js","title":"Google Analytics content grouping not working using gtag.js"},{"tags":["android","google-play","google-play-services"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570753450,"post_id":58332673,"comment_id":103022862,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332673/am-i-required-to-update-to-target-android-9-api-level-28#comment103022862_58332673"},{"owner":{"reputation":3334,"user_id":3418376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTky8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joe Scotto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3418376/joe-scotto"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":281204,"user_id":1863229,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4sh1l.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tim Biegeleisen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1863229/tim-biegeleisen"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570753918,"post_id":58332673,"comment_id":103022960,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332673/am-i-required-to-update-to-target-android-9-api-level-28#comment103022960_58332673"},{"owner":{"reputation":16469,"user_id":3145960,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/J90ZI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Reaz Murshed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3145960/reaz-murshed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570753998,"post_id":58332673,"comment_id":103022972,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332673/am-i-required-to-update-to-target-android-9-api-level-28#comment103022972_58332673"},{"owner":{"reputation":627,"user_id":6375170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zugq_QmaxMM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAPQ/U_tBeKw3rDg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ashok Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6375170/ashok-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570757780,"post_id":58332673,"comment_id":103023711,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332673/am-i-required-to-update-to-target-android-9-api-level-28#comment103023711_58332673"},{"owner":{"reputation":3274,"user_id":4729721,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a68628b01886ee639255e69111990484?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"a_local_nobody","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4729721/a-local-nobody"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570769383,"post_id":58332673,"comment_id":103025878,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332673/am-i-required-to-update-to-target-android-9-api-level-28#comment103025878_58332673"}],"owner":{"reputation":3334,"user_id":3418376,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pTky8.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Joe Scotto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3418376/joe-scotto"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":328,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570753264,"creation_date":1570753264,"question_id":58332673,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332673","body_markdown":"I received an email from Google stating that I am required to target Android 9 (API level 28) and after November 1, 2019 I will no longer be able to submit updates unless the app is updated.

So just add the padding byte explicitly, changing your format string to:\r\n\r\n    format = &#39;&lt;2s1sx4s4s2s4s&#39;\r\n\r\nThe `x` in there says &quot;I expect a byte here, but it&#39;s padding, don&#39;t unpack it to anything.&quot; It&#39;s possible the pad byte belongs elsewhere (I have no idea what your hardware is doing); I notice the third byte is the NUL (`\\0`) byte in both examples, but the spot I assumed would be padding is `&#39;R&#39;`, so it&#39;s possible you want:\r\n\r\n    format = &#39;&lt;2sx1s4s4s2s4s&#39;\r\n\r\ninstead. Or it could be somewhere else (without knowing which of the fields is a `char` array in the hardware struct, and which are larger types with alignment requirements, it&#39;s impossible to say). Point is, your hardware is sending 18 bytes; figure out which one is garbage, and put the `x` pad byte at the appropriate location.\r\n\r\nSide-note: The `repr` of `bytes` objects will use ASCII or simpler ASCII escapes when available. That&#39;s why you see an `R` and a `\\n` in your output; `b&#39;R&#39;` and `b&#39;\\x52&#39;` are equivalent literals, as are `b&#39;\\n&#39;` and `b&#39;\\x0a&#39;` and Python chooses to use the &quot;more readable&quot; version (when the `bytes` is actually just ASCII, this is *much* more readable).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332625/alignment-packing-in-python-struct-unpack/58332716#58332716","title":"Alignment/Packing in Python Struct.Unpack"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":5360139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9dcafcb1223ceaa4ddebf5efd8e3bb54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeremy Shubert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5360139/jeremy-shubert"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58332716,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570753671,"creation_date":1570752819,"question_id":58332625,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332625","body_markdown":"I have a piece of hardware sending data at a fixed length: 2bytes, 1 bytes, 4 bytes, 4 bytes, 2 bytes, 4bytes for a total of 17 bytes.

&quot;m/d&quot;)&lt;&gt;$A$1)*((M3:M-L3:L)&lt;0), K3:K+1, K3:K+0), ))\r\n\r\n_____________\r\n\r\n&gt;`=IF(AND(TEXT(K3,&quot;m/d&quot;)=$A$1,(M3-L3)&lt;0),TIMEVALUE(&quot;11:59:59 PM&quot;),M3+0)`\r\n\r\n    =ARRAYFORMULA(IF(K3:K&lt;&gt;&quot;&quot;, \r\n     IF((TEXT(K3,&quot;m/d&quot;)=$A$1)*((M3-L3)&lt;0), TIMEVALUE(&quot;11:59:59 PM&quot;), M3:M+0),

have asked a few questions related to this personal project of mine already on this platform, and this should be the last one since I am so close to finishing.  Below is the link to a mock example spreadsheet I&#39;ve created, which mimics what my actual project does but it contains less sensitive information and is also smaller in size.\r\n\r\n[Mock Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O3X8KI7Iliv2Gvd3PCFfFntX8xd1UQ-qY8coFpk6Q8Q/edit?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n**Basic rundown of the spreadsheet:**\r\n\r\n1. Pulls data from a master schedule which is controlled/edited by another party into the **_Master Schedule_** tab.\r\n\r\n2. In the columns adjacent to the imported data, an array formula expands the master schedule by classroom in case some of the time slots designate multiple rooms.  Additional formulas adjust the date, start time, and end time to be capped within the current day&#39;s 24-hour period.  The start time of each class is also made to be an hour earlier.\r\n\r\n3. In the **_Room Schedule_** tab, an hourly calendar is created based on the room number in the first column, and only corresponds to the current day.\r\n\r\nI have tested the spreadsheet extensively with multiple scenarios, and I&#39;m happy with how everything works except for the calculation time.  I figured the two volatile functions I use would take some processing time just by themselves, and I certainly didn&#39;t expect this to be lightning-fast especially without using a script, but the project that I am actually implementing this method for is much larger and takes a very long time to update.  The purpose of this spreadsheet is to allow users to find an open room and &quot;reserve&quot; it by clicking the checkbox next to it (which will consequently color the entire row red) allowing everyone else to know that it is now taken.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d like to know if there is any way to optimize / speed up my spreadsheet, or to not update it every time a checkbox is clicked and instead update it &quot;manually&quot;, similar to what OP is asking [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55905947/in-google-sheets-can-i-wrap-a-standard-function-in-a-custom-function-to-control).  I am not familiar with Apps Script nor am I well-versed in writing code overall, but I am willing to learn - I just need a push in the right direction since I am going into this blind.  I know the number of formulas in the **_Room Schedule_** tab is probably working against me yet I am so close to what I wanted the final product to be, so any help or insight is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nFeel free to ask any questions if I didn&#39;t explain this well enough.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332620/optimizing-speeding-up-calculation-time-in-google-sheets","title":"Optimizing / speeding up calculation time in Google Sheets"},{"tags":["python","ssh","fabric"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":403,"user_id":8621844,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9J2p6a1I_p8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAALY/PnMGY0y6OVE/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Isma&#239;l Mourtada","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8621844/isma%c3%afl-mourtada"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571504212,"creation_date":1571504212,"answer_id":58465960,"question_id":58332619,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58465960","body_markdown":"It&#39;s possible.\r\nThe `Connection.run` method accepts `kwargs`, especially a `env` dictionary.\r\nThis collection of env vars will be passed into your SSH session.\r\n\r\nNB: The documentation of the `Connection.run` is rather minimal.

{ this.setState({timer: this.state.timer + 1}); }, 1000);`I want it to add one per second and display the time live. 2 ways to do this from what i can surmise.\r\n\r\n 1. global variable `let timer = 0;` then immediately after, outside the class, under the globals `setInterval( () =&gt; { timer++; }, 1000);`. I tried this and then just use `timer={timer}` as a prop in the scoreboard component. It works, but only updates when something else re-renders. \r\n 2. state `timer: 0`. then use setState to change it. problem is, it starts acting really weird if i place the line `setInterval( () =&gt; { this.setState({timer: this.state.timer + 1}); }, 1000);` in the render method (like it keeps re rendering repeatedly.) and i can&#39;t figure out a way to run it outside the render method, as a method in class. \r\n\r\nany ideas on how i can get this time to run in my React component?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332609/trouble-with-a-timer-in-react","title":"trouble with a timer in React"},{"tags":["c#","wcf","soap"],"owner":{"reputation":557,"user_id":2778651,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dHkR0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"makdu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2778651/makdu"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570752652,"creation_date":1570752652,"question_id":58332605,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332605","body_markdown":"I am trying to find a way to write a  web Method that can handle soap MTOM format.

trying to print a page on my Angular app, whether by using window.print() or pressing Ctrl + P, the print window opens but doesn&#39;t display the majority of the content on the page. After the first attempt is cancelled, a second attempt will render the page correctly in the print window, but reloading the app will revert back to not displaying the content correctly in the print window.\r\n\r\nThe content that *is* shown is several ```&lt;div&gt;``` elements that are styled to serve as borders, as well as portions of parent components that are very far up the component tree (parts of the navbar component and the entire footer component, which are direct children of the app-component).\r\n\r\nAll content is correctly displayed on the page when this occurs, and is wrapped in an ```&lt;ng-container *ngIf=&quot;!loading&quot;&gt;``` element. Loading is set to false when all component data is received.\r\n\r\nThe component is loaded like so:\r\n```\r\nngOnInit() {\r\n  this.load();\r\n}\r\n\r\nload() {\r\n  // data is loaded from a service\r\n  this.loading = false;\r\n  setTimeout(window.print(), 500);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried calling the ```window.print()``` function in other lifecycle hooks (ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterViewInit) but with no noticeable change.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also tried setting longer timeouts, up to 20 seconds in length, but that also had no noticeable difference.\r\n\r\n**Edit**\r\nI tried logging ```document.ready``` to the console before the print attempt and it logged as  ```complete```\r\n\r\n**Edit 2**\r\nIt appears the problem stems from the stylesheet not being fully loaded when ```window.print()``` is called. I have managed a bandaid fix by moving the CSS for the component to a separate file, as the main stylesheet is extremely large. Although the solution is not optimal, it has resolved the issue.\r\n\r\nIs this a case of the DOM not being fully loaded and rendered when the ```window.print()``` function is called? If so, how can I ensure that it is before trying to print the page?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332600/how-do-i-wait-for-the-dom-to-load-completely-before-printing-the-page","title":"How do I wait for the DOM to load completely before printing

do not recommend writing your own image downloader whereas there are some libraries like [Glide][1] and [Picasso][2] that are already available for this purpose. \r\n\r\nIn your case, the problem might be, the `ImageView`s are taking some time to download the images first. Hence, I think you really should use `Glide` or `Picasso` to load your images into your `ImageView`s inside the `GridView`. \r\n\r\nI use Glide in most of the cases and its pretty simple to use and integrate. You do not have to write your `DownloadImage` class on your own. Just the following code snippet will do. \r\n\r\n     Glide\r\n        .with(context)\r\n        .load(url)\r\n        .into(imagview);\r\n\r\nTo integrate Glide, just add the following dependency in your `build.gradle` file, you are good to go!  \r\n\r\n    repositories {\r\n      mavenCentral()\r\n      google()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    dependencies {\r\n      implementation &#39;com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.10.0&#39;\r\n      annotationProcessor &#39;com.github.bumptech.glide:compiler:4.10.0&#39;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI hope that helps! \r\n\r\nIn case you are not comfortable with using external libraries, you need to implement the behavior that Glide implemented by yourself! \r\n\r\nYou need to lazy load the images when necessary. In a `GridView` the images are loaded on demand when visible. I recommend looking into the scroll options so that you can differentiate when there is a fling or a slight scroll. It&#39;s a bit tricky. I recommend looking into [this answer][3].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/bumptech/glide\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/square/picasso\r\n  [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/13265776/3145960","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332594/image-cannot-be-displayed-in-gridview/58332698#58332698","title":"Image cannot be displayed in GridView?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":608,"user_id":3733276,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6d11e41efbec5537522979d06df019ab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Freelancer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3733276/freelancer"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570759203,"creation_date":1570759203,"answer_id":58333281,"question_id":58332594,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58333281","body_markdown":"The error is caused by putting a `GridView` inside a `ScrollView`.

guarantees asynchronous delivery of events whereas `instance` can deliver events synchronously if it’s already on the main thread. \n\nAs for why you would ever need to force asynchronous delivery when you’re already on the main thread: it’s fairly rare and I would typically try to avoid it, but sometimes you have a recursive reactive pipeline where one event triggers the delivery of a new event in the same pipeline. If this happens synchronously, it breaks the Rx contract and RxSwift will spit out a warning that you tried to deliver a second event before the first event finished. In this case you can observe on `MainScheduler.asyncInstance` to break the cycle.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332584/rxswift-mainscheduler-instance-vs-mainscheduler-asyncinstance/58349277#58349277","title":"RxSwift -- MainScheduler.instance vs MainScheduler.asyncInstance"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9410757,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ea313444d369535cf0cdab210d27151?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"udi80z","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9410757/udi80z"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":76,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58349277,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570833899,"creation_date":1570752438,"question_id":58332584,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332584","body_markdown":"What is the difference between using RxSwift&#39;s **MainSchedule.instance** and **MainSchedule.asyncInstance** within the context of **observeOn**?

am using Jackson 2.9.6. I have a controller in which I am trying to send an Optional as one of my fields. When I receive a response from the controller I always get it in this format `{&quot;field&quot;:{&quot;present&quot;:true}}` (as shown in this [question][1]). \r\n\r\nBasically I have a RestTemplate bean configured as such:\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;restTemplate&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;messageConverters&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;list&gt;\r\n                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.http.converter.ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter&quot;/&gt;\r\n            &lt;/list&gt;\r\n        &lt;/property&gt;\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to add the Jdk8Module as part of the serialzation process. I noticed that there&#39;s a `MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter(ObjectMapper mapper)` constructor which takes in an ObjectMapper and I&#39;m thinking of creating an ObjectMapper bean which will have the Jdk8Module registered to it (using a public method called `registerModule(Module module)` found in the ObjectMapper class) so I can pass that module as such:\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;restTemplate&quot; class=&quot;org.springframework.web.client.RestTemplate&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;property name=&quot;messageConverters&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;list&gt;\r\n                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.http.converter.ByteArrayHttpMessageConverter&quot;/&gt;\r\n                &lt;bean class=&quot;org.springframework.http.converter.json.MappingJackson2HttpMessageConverter&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;constructor-arg name=&quot;objectMapper&quot; ref=&quot;ObjectMapperWithJDK8Bean&quot;&gt;&lt;/constructor-arg&gt;\r\n                &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n            &lt;/list&gt;\r\n        &lt;/property&gt;\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;bean id=&quot;ObjectMapperWithJDK8Bean&quot; class=&quot;com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper&quot;&gt;\r\n    * Pass in com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype.jdk8.Jdk8Module here via the method *\r\n    &lt;/bean&gt;\r\n\r\nBut the issue im current facing is how to call the `registModule` method from the xml file when creating the bean?

You can store the data locally in an SQLite database and then can read the data from there when needed. If your data is likely to be changed frequently, then it is not a good idea. You might consider using the caching system that comes with the `Volley`. To see how the caching will Volley can be implemented you can refer to [this link][1]. \r\n\r\nAnother way of doing it is by passing the data between your activities as objects. If the data is not likely to be changed during the activity transition, this is a good idea in my opinion. In this way, you do not load the data each time from the network. So once the data is read in the `MainActivity`, it can be passed to the `CardActivity` as an object or an intent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/a/32022946/3145960","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332552/how-to-preserve-the-data-without-it-being-loaded-when-navigated-between-activiti/58332781#58332781","title":"How to preserve the data without it being loaded when navigated between Activities"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6762,"user_id":908821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c4a1ce95e4e53e7f4a556810232e0e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Angel Koh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/908821/angel-koh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570756364,"post_id":58332922,"comment_id":103023418,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332552/how-to-preserve-the-data-without-it-being-loaded-when-navigated-between-activiti/58332922#comment103023418_58332922"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6762,"user_id":908821,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":68,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c4a1ce95e4e53e7f4a556810232e0e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Angel Koh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/908821/angel-koh"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570755913,"creation_date":1570755913,"answer_id":58332922,"question_id":58332552,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58332922","body_markdown":"You can consider setting your MainActivity as a SingleTop launch mode, and then let CardActivity start MainActivity via intent when the back button is pressed.\r\n\r\nthis will cause onNewIntent() to be called instead of onCreate().\r\n\r\nhttps://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onNewIntent(android.content.Intent)\r\n\r\n&gt; onNewIntent\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Added in API level 1\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; protected void onNewIntent (Intent intent)\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; This is called for activities that set launchMode to &quot;singleTop&quot; in\r\n&gt; their package, or if a client used the Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_SINGLE_TOP\r\n&gt; flag when calling startActivity(Intent).

The `map` block will evaluate `$resp_x_powered_by` by looking at the string in `$sent_http_x_powered_by`.\r\n3. If the string is `&quot;&quot;` then we use the default value of `&quot;x powered by is empty&quot;`. Otherwise, we use the value from the upstream server.\r\n\r\nWhy I did this:\r\n\r\n* Initially I tried to use `add_headers` with `map` as Raul suggested, but the issue lies in header duplication. If the header is set, then `add_header` will simply add another line to define the header again. A common workaround is to use `proxy_hide_header` but that blanks out the value so when we hit the `map` block, it will always evaluate to `&quot;&quot;`.\r\n* As you can see, there is an `add_header` block outside of the `location` block which would be overridden by scope inheritance. There are ways to get around it but `more_set_headers` solves that issue.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332539/how-to-use-the-response-header-from-an-upstream-host-but-also-provide-a-default/58345948#58345948","title":"How to use the response header from an upstream host but also provide a default value?"}],"owner":{"reputation":2869,"user_id":1361802,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0440e3fbea04c07ebf4503982b6edf3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"wonton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1361802/wonton"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58345948,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570814708,"creation_date":1570751991,"question_id":58332539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58332539","body_markdown":"I have an nginx conf which I pair with various applications to act as a reverse proxy.\r\n\r\nI would like to enforce some specific response headers but allow the upstream service the freedom to override them.\r\n\r\nIf the inheritance rules for nginx were different, I would do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n        if ($sent_http_x_content_length = &#39;&#39;) {\r\n            add_header X-Content-Length &quot;nosniff&quot;

If they do not intersect for 6 bars, then x = 80, if they intersect, end the cycle by setting the value x = 0\r\n\r\n    b=1\r\n    for n=1 to 6\r\n        if k1[n]==k2[n]\r\n            break\r\n        else\r\n            b:=b+1\r\n            continue\r\n    x=0\r\n    if b==7\r\n        x:=80\r\n    else\r\n        x:=0\r\n    plot(x, linewidth=3)\r\n\r\nI would like it to have &quot;b&quot; different meanings, from which I could build on and draw a graph in the future. But for some reason, always b = 6","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332518/need-parser-for-bars","title":"Need parser for

I could understand about the reason of your issue. The service account is different from your own account. So the Google Drive of service account is different from that of your account. By this, when a file is uploaded to the root folder using your script, the file is uploaded to the root folder of the Drive of service account. By this, the file cannot be seen at the drive of your account.

should only dispatch and update state if you have code that _cares_ about said state updates. For example, if you&#39;re just wanting to show a single spinner then have the spinner go away when fully completed, your user doesn&#39;t necessarily care about each atomic operation, so you don&#39;t need it reflected in state. If you have a UI that does show each, then you would want those extra dispatches.\r\n\r\nBy the way, your Promises look a bit overcomplicated.

It initially had all API calls inside the `componentDidMount` and it was so messy.\r\n\r\nI am using `redux-thunk` to move this out from the class component.\r\n\r\nThe `fetchDatabase` in my `databaseAction.js` does everything that `componentDidMount` did in the class component.\r\n\r\nNormally if it was a single API call, I would have just dispatched the `fetchDbSuccess` as the API call was done successfully. However, using `Promise.All` which takes three async API calls, I am not sure whether I should\r\n\r\n1. create a separate action for each API call (`fetchProfileSuccess`, `fetchReleaseSuccess`, and `fetchUserSuccess`) and dispatch each one of them at the end of each Promise (the place where I put `//Use Dispatch Here?` in the code.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n2. Just dispatch single `fetchDbSuccess` when the `Promise.all` gets resolved.\r\n\r\nIf I choose to do 2, am I supposed to update all three `states` in my reducer?\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332506/what-is-the-better-correct-way-of-using-promise-all-with-react-redux-thunk","title":"What is the better/correct way of

possible to implement such a command (or a similar one)?\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n----\r\n\r\nI forgot to say that the content of the button, ie what is written inside the div, should also be possible to be a wordpress shortcode, which is a shortcut/macro for a longer piece of code or text.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332505/place-a-button-and-its-div-with-one-command","title":"Place a

do I need to set up this `HttpInterceptor`? `oidcSecurityService` is not defined.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe `HttpClient` allows you to write interceptors. A common usecase would be to intercept any outgoing HTTP request and add an authorization header. Keep in mind that injecting `OidcSecurityService` into the interceptor via the constructor results in a cyclic dependency. To avoid this use the injector instead.\r\n``` typescript\r\n@Injectable()\r\nexport class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {\r\n    private oidcSecurityService: OidcSecurityService;\r\n\r\n    constructor(private injector: Injector) {}\r\n\r\n    intercept(req: HttpRequest&lt;any&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;any&gt;&gt; {\r\n        let requestToForward = req;\r\n\r\n        if (this.oidcSecurityService === undefined) {\r\n            this.oidcSecurityService = this.injector.get(OidcSecurityService);\r\n        }\r\n        if (this.oidcSecurityService !== undefined) {\r\n            let token = this.oidcSecurityService.getToken();\r\n            if (token !== &#39;&#39;) {\r\n                let tokenValue = &#39;Bearer &#39; + token;\r\n                requestToForward = req.clone({ setHeaders: { Authorization: tokenValue } });\r\n            }\r\n        } else {\r\n            console.debug(&#39;OidcSecurityService undefined: NO auth header!&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return next.handle(requestToForward);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is in my app.module. \r\nI need to get the `OidcSecurityService` injected. \r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n  providers: [\r\n    OidcSecurityService,\r\n    OidcConfigService,\r\n    {\r\n      provide: APP_INITIALIZER,\r\n      useFactory: loadConfig,\r\n      deps: [OidcConfigService],\r\n      multi: true\r\n    },   \r\n    AuthorizationGuard,\r\n    {\r\n      provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, \r\n      useClass: AuthInterceptor, \r\n      multi: true\r\n    }    \r\n

I want to make the process more automated (check &quot;top&quot; or &quot;bottom&quot; in an existing userform and have the macro place the two-column figure accordingly on the current page).\r\n\r\nAgain, I am able programmatically move the cursor to the top or bottom of the page just fine, I just can&#39;t get the cursor to the end of the first column (the left-hand column on the two-column page). Our code inserts continuous section breaks and works well if it can insert the first of those breaks at the end of the left-hand column of text.\r\n\r\nBased in part on CindyM&#39;s suggestion, I tried the following for a two-column Visio diagram at the bottom of the current page, but things go wrong after the third line of code. Other than this initial VBA-driven cursor placement problem, the rest of my code works fine (selects the Visio, inserts continuous breaks, inserts a caption for the figure, etc.). Hope this helps clarify. Thanks again!\r\n\r\n```VBA\r\n    `ActiveDocument.Bookmarks(&quot;\\Page&quot;) `Select selects current page` \r\n    Selection.GoToNext (wdGoToPage)  `cursor at top of page 2`\r\n    Selection.MoveEnd wdCharacter, -1 `cursor now at end of target page`\r\n    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdItem  `cursor now in headline, top of page :(`  \r\n    Selection.MoveRight Unit:=wdItem\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OR7BF.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332486/need-word-vba-code-to-move-cursor-to-end-of-first-column-in-two-column-page-layo","title":"Need Word VBA code to move cursor to end of first column in two-column page layout"},{"tags":["python","python-unittest"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4711,"user_id":1255356,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSG5g.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pablo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255356/pablo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570751435,"creation_date":1570751435,"answer_id":58332485,"question_id":58332484,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58332485","body_markdown":"One way in which this can be done is by doing it in the `setUp` code of your `TestCase` subclass.

You are just missing two important edge cases when dealing with linked list. First is when you are using `find_node` to insert some value, but it&#39;s gonna be add in the beginning in the list. In this case your newly created node becomes a new head of a list so you have to update a `head` variable. The second edge case is kind of opposite, it happens when you are inserting the new node to the end of the list. Then it becomes an end of a list so you need to update `tail`.\r\n\r\nMissing those two edge cases happens a lot when first working with the linked lists, so don&#39;t worry.

However, when on definition only its signature is run immediately; its body is stored and only run when the function is called.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; def func(arg=print(&quot;default evaluated&quot;)):\r\n    ...     print(&quot;body evaluated&quot;)\r\n    ...\r\n    default evaluated\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; func\r\n    &lt;function __main__.func(arg=None)&gt;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; func()\r\n    body evaluated\r\n\r\nWhen you define a function inside an exception handler, this exception handler only receives exceptions raised from evaluating the signature. For example, computing a default argument may raise a ``ZeroDivisionError``:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; def invalid_def(arg=10/0):\r\n    ...     pass\r\n    ...\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n\r\nAn exception handler for this case is rarely what you want. It can be useful to conditionally define a function, e.g. if a ``NameError`` indicates a dependency is not available.\r\n\r\nCommonly you want to handle an exception originating in the body of a function. These are raised whenever the function is actually called:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; def invalid_call():\r\n    ...     return 10 / 0\r\n    ...\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; invalid_call()\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in invalid_call\r\n    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; invalid_call()\r\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n      File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in invalid_call\r\n    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to handle such exceptions: externally or internally.\r\n\r\n* External handling requires an exception handler at *each* call site. This is more flexible but requires boilerplate, since it requires an exception handler for each call.\r\n\r\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; try:\r\n        ...     invalid_call()\r\n        ... except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n        ...     print(&quot;suppressed an external error&quot;)\r\n\r\n* Internal handling requires an exception handler in the body. This is less flexible but needs no boilerplate, since one exception handler covers all cases.\r\n\r\n        &gt;&gt;&gt; def valid_call():\r\n        ...     try:\r\n        ...         return 10 / 0\r\n        ...     except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n        ...         print(&quot;suppressed an internal error&quot;)\r\n\r\nBoth approaches are valid; which to select depends on whether you rather need usability or re-usability. Notably, it is not uncommon to combine both approaches: an internal handler generalises the exception, and external handler expects only general exceptions.\r\n\r\nFor example, in your case that would allow to handle multiple operations:\r\n\r\n    def div(a, b):\r\n        try:\r\n            return  a / b\r\n        # convert operation-specific exception to general one\r\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n            raise ValueError(&quot;Cannot divide by 0&quot;)\r\n\r\n    # may be another operation -- add, mul, sub, ...\r\n    operation = div\r\n    \r\n    try:\r\n        operation(10, 0)\r\n    # only handle exception general to all operations\r\n    except ValueError as err:\r\n        print(&quot;Invalid values: %s&quot; % err)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58332468/exception-handling-is-ignored-with-try-except-around-a-function-definition/58341917#58341917","title":"Exception handling is ignored with try-except around a function definition"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18721,"user_id":146073,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2c69ccb9eb83c7ef2ba155a850df68a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"holdenweb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/146073/holdenweb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570807111,"creation_date":1570807111,"answer_id":58344225,"question_id":58332468,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58344225","body_markdown":"My take on this question (clearly interesting enough to provoke multiple answers, well done) is to remember that in Python class and function definitions are executed like most other statements. \r\n\r\n    try:\r\n        def di (a, b):\r\n            return  a/b\r\n    except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n        print &quot;Divide by 0 Error&quot;\r\n\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n&quot;Attempt to define a function called `di` that returns the dividend of its arguments. If defining the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError` exception, print an explanatory message.&quot; No exception will be raised.\r\n\r\nI suspect what is required is instead:\r\n\r\n&quot;Define a function that attempts to return the dividend of its arguments. If the division raises a `ZeriDivisionError` exception the function prints an explanatory message and returns `None`.&quot; So the `def` should be around the whole function&#39;s logic:\r\n\r\n    def di(a, b):\r\n        try:\r\n            return a/b\r\n        except ZeroDivisionError:\r\n            print &quot;Divide by 0 error&quot;\r\n\r\nAs a more general point of program design, such a function is somewhat badly-coupled. Python programmers would probably conclude, unless constrained by other factors, that it was simpler to leave the exception uncaught: presumably the caller currently has to test for `None` to determine whether an exception occurred, so why not just trap the exception wherever it actually has to be handled, and handle it there?\r\n\r\nIndicating the invalidity of data by returning an object of a different type makes for complex and hard-to-read code, and is probably best avoided in the long term.

Firstly, we need an **AuthenticationHandler** &amp; **Options** to authenticate request with an API Token(Client Secret). Suppose you&#39;ve created such an Authentication Handler &amp; Options:\r\n    ```csharp\r\n    public class ClientSecretAuthenOpts : AuthenticationSchemeOptions\r\n    {\r\n        public const string DefaultAuthenticationSchemeName = &quot;ClientSecret&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class ClientSecretAuthenticationHandler : AuthenticationHandler&lt;ClientSecretAuthenOpts&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        public ClientSecretAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor&lt;ClientSecretAuthenOpts&gt; options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock) \r\n            : base(options, logger, encoder, clock) { }\r\n    \r\n        protected override async Task&lt;AuthenticateResult&gt; HandleAuthenticateAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            // ... authenticate request \r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. And then **register multiple Authentication Schemes one by one**:\r\n    ```csharp\r\n    // add mulitple authentication schemes\r\n    services.AddAuthentication(AzureADDefaults.AuthenticationScheme)           // set AzureAD as the default for users (using the UI)\r\n        .AddAzureAD(options =&gt; Configuration.Bind(&quot;AzureAD&quot;, options))         // setup AzureAD Authentication\r\n        .AddScheme&lt;ClientSecretAuthenOpts,ClientSecretAuthenticationHandler&gt;(  // setup ClientSecret Authentication\r\n            ClientSecretAuthenOpts.DefaultAuthenticationSchemeName,\r\n            opts=&gt;{ }\r\n        );\r\n    \r\n    // post configuration for OIDC\r\n    services.Configure&lt;OpenIdConnectOptions&gt;(AzureADDefaults.OpenIdScheme, options =&gt;{\r\n        options.Authority = options.Authority + &quot;/v2.0/&quot;;         // Microsoft identity platform\r\n        options.TokenValidationParameters.ValidateIssuer = false; // accept several tenants \r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Finally, in order to enable **multiple authentication schemes** at the same time, we need **override the default policy**:\r\n    ```csharp\r\n    services.AddAuthorization(opts =&gt; {\r\n        // allow AzureAD &amp; our own ClientSecret Authentication at the same time\r\n        var pb = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder(\r\n            ClientSecretAuthenOpts.DefaultAuthenticationSchemeName,\r\n            &quot;AzureAD&quot;\r\n        );  \r\n        opts.DefaultPolicy = pb.RequireAuthenticatedUser().Build();\r\n    });\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Demo &amp; Test\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose your API token (client secret) is sent in Request Header as below :\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\nGET https://localhost:5001/Home/Privacy HTTP/1.1\r\n&lt;b&gt;Api-Subscription-Id&lt;/b&gt;: Smith\r\n&lt;b&gt;Api-Subscription-Key&lt;/b&gt;: top secret\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nTo avoid hardcoding the header name, I create add two properties in the options:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ClientSecretAuthenOpts : AuthenticationSchemeOptions\r\n{\r\n    public const string DefaultAuthenticationSchemeName = &quot;ClientSecret&quot;;\r\n    public string ApiClientIdHeadername {get;set;}= &quot;Api-Subscription-Id&quot;;\r\n    public string ApiClientTokenHeaderName {get;set;}= &quot;Api-Subscription-Key&quot;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIn order to authenticate above request, I create a custom Authentication Handler as below:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class ClientSecretAuthenticationHandler : AuthenticationHandler&lt;ClientSecretAuthenOpts&gt;\r\n{\r\n    public ClientSecretAuthenticationHandler(IOptionsMonitor&lt;ClientSecretAuthenOpts&gt; options, ILoggerFactory logger, UrlEncoder encoder, ISystemClock clock) \r\n        : base(options, logger, encoder, clock) { }\r\n\r\n    protected override async Task&lt;AuthenticateResult&gt; HandleAuthenticateAsync()\r\n    {\r\n        // if there&#39;s no header for Client ID &amp; Client Sercet, skip\r\n        if(\r\n            Context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(Options.ApiClientIdHeadername, out var clientIdHeader) &amp;&amp;\r\n            Context.Request.Headers.TryGetValue(Options.ApiClientTokenHeaderName, out var clientSecretHeader) \r\n        ){\r\n            // validate client&#39;s id &amp;

ValidateApiKeyAsync(string clientId,string clientSecret)\r\n    {\r\n        ClaimsIdentity id = null;\r\n        // fake: need check key against the Database or other service\r\n        if(clientId==&quot;Smith&quot;
