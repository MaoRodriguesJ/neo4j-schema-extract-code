I found the answer.\r\n\r\nThe GNU Makefile manual uses this method for rebuilding makefiles when including them. The manual states:\r\n\r\n&gt; To this end, after reading in all makefiles, make will consider each\r\n&gt; as a goal target and attempt to update it. If a makefile has a rule\r\n&gt; which says how to update it (found either in that very makefile or in\r\n&gt; another one) or if an implicit rule applies to it (see Using Implicit\r\n&gt; Rules), it will be updated if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn other words, every file that is included is considered a goal target. And that&#39;s why, when I include the file `myfile.txt`, it runs the recipe for the target that matches that file.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the link to where I found the answer:\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Remaking-Makefiles.html#Remaking-Makefiles","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458957/building-a-target-by-including-a-non-existing-file/58459099#58459099","title":"Building a Target by Including a Non-Existing File"}],"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":5071304,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/48fcec5627ec098ae422e6272e507a1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"cDreamer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5071304/cdreamer"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571439823,"creation_date":1571438414,"question_id":58458957,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458957","body_markdown":"I have a simple Makefile that I am trying to understand and find documentation for why it works, so I&#39;m hoping someone here can help me with both aspects.\r\n\r\nHere is my Makefile: \r\n    \r\n    TEMP_DIR = ~/Desktop/temp\r\n     \r\n    default:\r\n        $(info &quot;reached default&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    $(TEMP_DIR)/myfile.txt:\r\n        $(info &quot;running temp_dir target&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    -include $(addprefix $(TEMP_DIR)/, myfile.txt)\r\n\r\nNow I understand that when you call make without passing a target, it will read the entire Makefile and then process the first target. In this case it would be the target `default`.\r\n\r\nWhen make reads the last line, it will check to see if the file `myfile.txt` is there and include it. If it&#39;s not, then it should not throw any error because I am using the `-include` directive. As stated from the GNU make manual:\r\n\r\n&gt; If you want make to simply ignore a makefile which does not exist or\r\n&gt; cannot be remade, with no error message, use the -include directive\r\n&gt; instead of include\r\n\r\nHowever, by including this non-existent file, it causes the second target to be executed. So I get the following output when I run make:\r\n\r\n    &quot;running temp_dir target&quot;\r\n    &quot;reached default&quot;\r\n    make: `default&#39; is up to date.\r\n\r\nMy question is, why is it executing that target? My second question is, is there documentation about building targets by including non-existent files? This doesn&#39;t seem like a traditional way of rebuilding a target to me.\r\n\r\nAlso as some further study, if I comment out the include line, I get the following output:\r\n\r\n    &quot;reached default&quot;\r\n    make: `default&#39; is up to date.\r\n\r\nThat way I can confirm that including the non-existent file is actually causing the second target to be rebuilt.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458957/building-a-target-by-including-a-non-existing-file","title":"Building a Target by Including a Non-Existing File"},{"tags":["java","maven","maven-javadoc-plugin"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11756316,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/630a0187e44bd05479e5e5c632e60af6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nate","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11756316/nate"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571438396,"creation_date":1571438396,"question_id":58458955,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458955","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to use maven-javadoc-plugin-2.10.4 on JDK 1.8_141, and it took me debugging the source code of this plugin to realize that the configuration I had set for this plugin in my pom.xml file that none of configuration (particularly sourceFileExcludes list) is not loaded in AbstractJavadocMojo.java. \r\n\r\nPlayed around with placement of &lt;configuration&gt;

document.getElementById(&quot;myInput&quot;);\r\n  filter = input.value.toUpperCase();\r\n  table = document.getElementById(&quot;myTable&quot;);\r\n  tr =

row:\r\n```js\r\ntr[i].style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n```\r\nIf the row does match, you clear the `display:hidden`, making it visible again\r\n```js\r\ntr[i].style.display = &quot;&quot;;\r\n```\r\nYou can replace these with your custom styles.  \r\nExample, change the background of all the rows that match to yellow:\r\n```js\r\nif (txtValue.toUpperCase().indexOf(filter) &gt; -1) {\r\n    tr[i].style.backgroundColor = &quot;yellow&quot;;\r\n} else {\r\n    tr[i].style.backgroundColor = &quot;white&quot;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIf you want to highlight only the part that matches, you can wrap all occurences in a span with a class for styling:\r\n```js\r\n&#160;if (txtValue.indexOf(filter) &gt; -1) {\r\n &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;tr[i].innerHTML = tr[i].innerHTML.replace(filter, `&lt;span class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;${filter}&lt;/span&gt;`)\r\n &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; }\r\n```\r\nAnd removing the existing highlights everytime:\r\n```js\r\nconst existing = document.getElementsByClassName(&quot;highlight&quot;); Array.from(existing).forEach(e =&gt; e.outerHTML=e.innerHTML)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore making the whole code:\r\n```html\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n&lt;head&gt;\r\n&lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;style&gt;\r\n* {\r\n

Build FW image to produce a raw binary, without a CRC-32 value\r\n 2. Calculate CRC-32 on the raw binary image, third-party tool\r\n 3. Insert the calculated CRC-32 into linker script, rebuild FW image\r\n\r\nNote: For STM32CubeIDE, you will want to have your own `*.elf` project that includes the STM32CubeMX project as a static library. Otherwise, STM32CubeMX will overwrite your linker script each time it generates new code.\r\n\r\nSince each project tends to have a slightly different linker script, I am going to demonstrate using a `.test_crc` sector. Insert the following into your `*.ld` linker script:\r\n\r\n      .test_crc :\r\n      {\r\n      \t_image_start = .;\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x31)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x32)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x33)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x34)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x35)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x36)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x37)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x38)\r\n    \tBYTE( 0x39)\r\n    \t\r\n        /* FW Image Header */ \r\n        LONG( _image_end - _image_start ) /* Size of FW image */\r\n        LONG( _image_start ) /* Base address to load FW image */\r\n        \r\n        /* Place this at the end of the FW image */\r\n        _image_end = .;\r\n        _IMAGE_CRC = ABSOLUTE(0x0); /* Using CRC-32C (aka zip checksum) */  \r\n        /*LONG( (-_IMAGE_CRC) - 1 ) /* Uncomment to append value, comment to calculate new value  */\r\n      } &gt;FLASH\r\n\r\nAdd the following as a post-build step in STM32CubeIDE (generates the raw binary image):\r\n\r\n    arm-none-eabi-objcopy -S -O binary -j .test_crc ${ProjName}.elf ${ProjName}.bin\r\n\r\nNow your ready to test/evaluate the process:\r\n\r\n 1. Rebuild your project to generate a `*.bin` file.\r\n 2. Using a third-party tool, calculate a CRC-32 checksum. I use 7-Zip command-line interface to generate the CRC-32C value for the `*.bin` file\r\n 3. Append the calculated CRC-32C. In the linker script, set the `0x0` in the following  `_IMAGE_CRC = ABSOLUTE(0x0)` to match your calculated value. Uncomment the following:\r\n\r\n`LONG( (-_IMAGE_CRC) - 1 ) /* Uncomment to append value, comment to calculate new value  */`\r\n\r\n\r\n 4. Rebuild your image and run the third-party CRC utility, it should now report `0xFFFFFFFF` for a CRC-32C value.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready to apply this to your actual FW image, do the following:\r\n\r\n 1. Change the post-build step to dump the full binary: `arm-none-eabi-objcopy -S -O binary ${ProjName}.elf ${ProjName}.bin`\r\n 2. Move `_image_start = .;` in front of your vector table.\r\n 3. Move the following after your vector table:\r\n\r\n`   /* FW Image Header */ \r\n    LONG( _image_end - _image_start ) /* Size of FW image */\r\n    LONG( _image_start ) /* Base address to load FW image */`\r\n\r\n 4. Move the following to end of the last sector:\r\n\r\n`   /* Place this at the end of the FW image */\r\n    _image_end = .;\r\n    _IMAGE_CRC = ABSOLUTE(0x0); /* Using CRC-32C (aka zip checksum) */  \r\n    /*LONG( (-_IMAGE_CRC) - 1 ) /* Uncomment to append value, comment to calculate new value  */`\r\n\r\nYou may find that you actually do not need the CRC value built into the image, and can just append the CRC value to the `*.bin`. Then provide the `*.bin` to your bootloader. The `*.bin` will still contain the load address and size of FW image, +4 bytes for the appended CRC value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458930/eclipse-cdt-stm32-force-predefined-program-memory/58475495#58475495","title":"Eclipse CDT &amp; STM32: force predefined program memory"}],"owner":{"reputation":46,"user_id":9564464,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/df0561201b7462e01b1b2e4742730776?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user9564464","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9564464/user9564464"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14192,"user_id":6505250,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FgNJn.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"howlger","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6505250/howlger"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58464378,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571592523,"creation_date":1571438117,"last_edit_date":1571481577,"question_id":58458930,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458930","body_markdown":"I have an uncommon but in my eyes reasonable use case:\r\nI have to build two STM32 firmware images: a boot loader and an application (by using the latest Eclipse CDT based IDE from ST Microelectronics, called: &quot;STM32CubeIDE&quot;).\r\n\r\nBecause my constraints are mostly low power consumption and not security, therefore I have only the requirement for data integrity for the DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) scenario and for this I implemented a CRC32 check over the complete FW images. The tricky part is, that the firmware itself contains its actually size within a C-struct at a fixed offset address 0x200 in the code memory (the benefit for this design is, that not the complete code memory has to be transmitted, but the FW is always protected by the CRC32):\r\n\r\nThe layout of a firmware is something like this:\r\n\r\n    &lt;ISR Table&gt; &lt;FW-Header@FixedAddress0x200&gt; &lt;RestFWCode&gt; &quot; + CRC32\r\n\r\n 1. FW Header contains FW size\r\n 2. The complete FW size which is used by the booloader to flash the application is the stored FW size (see 1.) + 4 byte of the appended CRC32\r\n\r\n\r\nFor my implementation I need to replace a memory area within the &quot;FW Header&quot; area with the actual FW size (which is only available after the build process).\r\n\r\nFor this I made a python script which patches the binary &quot;*.bin&quot; file, but it seems, that Eclipse/GDB uses for debugging the ELF-file, which looks for me much more complicated for a custom patch compared to the binary image, since I found no easy way to do this (to replace the actual FW size and append the 4 bytes of the CRC32).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I thought the easiest way would be to patch the code memory right after the firmware got loader from the debugger.\r\nI tested successfully a command-line tool from ST which can manipulate arbitrary memory even in the code memory (my code  memory starts at 0x08000000 + application at offset 0x4000 and FW header at &#246;ffset 0x200 -&gt; 0x08004200):\r\n\r\n    ST-LINK_CLI.exe -c SWD -w32 0x08004200 0xAABBCCDD\r\n(see: https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/cd00262073.pdf)\r\n\r\nMy Problem is, I don&#39;t know how to initiate this simple EXE call right before the debugger got attached to the MCU... I tried the &quot;Debug Configuration&quot;-&gt; &quot;Startup&quot; -&gt; &quot;Run Commands&quot;, but without success... \r\n\r\nDoes anybody know a way how to achieve this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458930/eclipse-cdt-stm32-force-predefined-program-memory","title":"Eclipse CDT &amp; STM32: force predefined program memory"},{"tags":["python","python-3.x","macos","subprocess","escaping"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5397497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153533963280250/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5397497/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571440493,"post_id":58458964,"comment_id":103255032,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458929/having-an-issue-escaping-an-ampersand-in-a-link-when-calling-mail-utility-in-mac/58458964#comment103255032_58458964"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5397497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153533963280250/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5397497/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571463424,"post_id":58458964,"comment_id":103257959,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458929/having-an-issue-escaping-an-ampersand-in-a-link-when-calling-mail-utility-in-mac/58458964#comment103257959_58458964"},{"owner":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5397497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153533963280250/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5397497/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571525178,"post_id":58458964,"comment_id":103271568,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458929/having-an-issue-escaping-an-ampersand-in-a-link-when-calling-mail-utility-in-mac/58458964#comment103271568_58458964"},{"owner":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5397497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153533963280250/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5397497/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571528335,"post_id":58458964,"comment_id":103272027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458929/having-an-issue-escaping-an-ampersand-in-a-link-when-calling-mail-utility-in-mac/58458964#comment103272027_58458964"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":112,"user_id":5397497,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10153533963280250/picture?type=large","display_name":"Brian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5397497/brian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571544282,"post_id":58458964,"comment_id":103273891,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458929/having-an-issue-escaping-an-ampersand-in-a-link-when-calling-mail-utility-in-mac/58458964#comment103273891_58458964"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571463399,"last_edit_date":1571463399,"creation_date":1571438461,"answer_id":58458964,"question_id":58458929,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58458964","body_markdown":"`&amp;` is the separator between parameters in the URL.

am working on a project where I get a json from firebase, and I want to end up creating a table and graphs using this data, but I&#39;m not too sure if itll be easy to work with json vs querying from a database to dynamically load a table and a graph. I dont know if i should make Pojo&#39;s or store the information into a in memory java database. The json values are dynamic, so it&#39;s pretty hard to figure out how to parse through it\r\n\r\ni tried implementing the h2 dependancy, but got a lot of errors there since the title of the json will

Is it possible to post a runnable version that illustrates the problem? I also suggest adding [NSubstitute.Analyzers](https://nsubstitute.github.io/help/nsubstitute-analysers/) to your project as it can help detect issues that sometimes causing confusing test behaviour.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a simplified version that demonstrates everything working correctly. If it is possible to modify this to reproduce the problem that would be really helpful!\r\n\r\nFirst, some supporting types:\r\n\r\n    public interface IRepository {\r\n        ValueForEntity GetValueForEntity(int v);\r\n        void InsertValueForEntity(int v, ValueForEntity valueForEntity);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class RealRepository : IRepository {\r\n        private readonly IDictionary&lt;int, ValueForEntity&gt; data = new Dictionary&lt;int, ValueForEntity&gt;();\r\n        public ValueForEntity GetValueForEntity(int v) =&gt; data[v];\r\n        public void InsertValueForEntity(int v, ValueForEntity valueForEntity) =&gt; data[v] = valueForEntity;           \r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ValueForEntity {\r\n        public int Id { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThen a rough approximation of the subject being tested:\r\n\r\n    public class EntityFactory {\r\n        private readonly IRepository repo;\r\n        public EntityFactory(IRepository repo) =&gt; this.repo = repo;\r\n        public ValueForEntity CreateEntity(int id) {\r\n            repo.InsertValueForEntity(id, new ValueForEntity { Id = id });\r\n            return repo.GetValueForEntity(id);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFinally, here&#39;s a passing version of the posted test (I had XUnit rather than NUnit handy so changed the assertion and test attribute accordingly):\r\n\r\n    [Fact]\r\n    public void Example() {\r\n        var realRepository = new RealRepository();\r\n        var proxyRepository = Substitute.For&lt;IRepository&gt;();\r\n\r\n        proxyRepository\r\n            .When(repo =&gt;

\r\n\r\n        proxyRepository.Received().InsertValueForEntity(entity.Id, Arg.Any&lt;ValueForEntity&gt;());\r\n        proxyRepository.Received().GetValueForEntity(Arg.Is(entity.Id));\r\n        Assert.Equal(42, entity.Id);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI know the types don&#39;t exactly match, but hopefully you can use this working example to find out the main difference that is causing problems in your fixture.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, is it worth using a substitute at all here if you could just use `realRepository`?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458918/why-isnt-nsubstitute-return-called/58461328#58461328","title":"Why isn&#39;t NSubstitute.Return called?"}],"owner":{"reputation":15699,"user_id":3279,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":76,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3fbc237a51acf024e65ae4da233f58e2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ben Collins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3279/ben-collins"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1968,"user_id":227779,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":38,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04b9cea001c22cc62e650a3180a1123a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Per Lundberg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/227779/per-lundberg"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58461328,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571472961,"creation_date":1571437985,"last_edit_date":1571472961,"question_id":58458918,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458918","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using [NSubstitute](https://nsubstitute.github.io/) in an integration test by wrapping a real implementation with a mock, like this:\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nvar realRepository = container.Get&lt;IRepository&gt;();\r\nvar proxyRepository = Substitute.For&lt;IRepository&gt;();\r\n\r\nproxyRepository\r\n    .When(repo =&gt;

Let&#39;s say I have a Employee, Devloper and Manager class. Developer inherits from Employee, pretty straight forward, the Manager should inherit from Employee, or Developer. So in essence always inherit from Empolyee and possible also from Developer. Is there a way to do this? Or am I complicating it somehow and shouldn&#39;t use inheritance in the first place.\r\n\r\nI got it to work in my own dirt method but it feels like a hacky workaround. Maybe this is the right way to do this but I should somehow restrict useage.\r\n\r\nThis is my manager class with the hacky workaround, I am basically checking the length of the passed arguments and deciding if they belong to a Developer of Employee:\r\n```\r\nclass Manager(Developer or Employee):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        print(args, kwargs)\r\n        if len(args) == 2:\r\n            Employee.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n        elif len(args) == 3:\r\n            Developer.__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)\r\n        else:\r\n            print(&#39;error&#39;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Employee and Developer classes being these:\r\n```\r\nclass Employee:\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, first, last):\r\n        self.first = first\r\n        self.last = last\r\n\r\n    def fullname(self):\r\n        return &#39;{} {}&#39;.format(self.first, self.last)\r\n\r\nclass Developer(Employee):\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, first, last, language):\r\n        super().__init__(first, last) #or Employee.__init__()\r\n        self.language = language\r\n\r\n    #Why can i not do something like:\r\n    #def __init__(self, language):\r\n    #    self.language = language\r\n    #And because the class extends Employee it would also need it&#39;s arguments, them being in order from lowest on inheritance ladder to highest.\r\n\r\n    def getlang(self):\r\n        return self.language\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also commented another smaller question here, I felt like if I get restricted to using just a single &quot;layer&quot; of classes I can inherit. Why would I need to pass all arguments to the `__init__()` and why can python not just figure out what others it would need for the subclasses and pass them along &quot;under the hood&quot;.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I am doing any other ill-advised things.

Or do I need to create a copy for each pipeline?

When a thread calls Abort on itself, the effect is similar to throwing an exception; the ThreadAbortException happens immediately, and the result is predictable. However, if one thread calls Abort on another thread, the abort interrupts whatever code is running. There is also a chance that a static constructor could be aborted. In rare cases, this might prevent instances of that class from being created in that application domain.\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n&gt; For example, calling Thread.Abort may prevent static constructors from executing or prevent the release of unmanaged resources. \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWhile your example elegantly shows that a static constructor may not be interrupted, there is no guarantee for this behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# UPDATE\r\n\r\nHere is an example where the static ctor is interrupted with Abort().\r\n\r\n## Code\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic static void Main()\r\n{\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;START&quot;);\r\n    var t = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n    {\r\n        var m = new MyCls();\r\n    });\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;t.Start&quot;);\r\n    t.Start();\r\n\r\n    Thread.Sleep(2000);\r\n    Console.WriteLine($&quot;Trying to create a new object&quot;);\r\n\r\n    try\r\n    {\r\n        var m2 = new MyCls();\r\n\r\n    }\r\n    catch (Exception ex) { Console.WriteLine(ex); }\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;All done&quot;);\r\n    Console.ReadLine();\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\npublic class MyCls\r\n{\r\n    static MyCls()\r\n    {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n        {\r\n            if (i == 4)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine($&quot;sctor calling Abort on itself&quot;);\r\n                Thread.CurrentThread.Abort();\r\n            };\r\n            Console.WriteLine($&quot;sctor.{i}&quot;);\r\n            Thread.Sleep(100);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Output\r\n\r\n```\r\nSTART\r\nt.Start\r\nsctor.0\r\nsctor.1\r\nsctor.2\r\nsctor.3\r\nsctor calling Abort on itself\r\nTrying to create a new object\r\nSystem.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for &#39;MyCls&#39; threw an exception. ---&gt; System.Threading.ThreadAbortException: Thread was being aborted.\r\n   at System.Threading.Thread.AbortInternal()\r\n   at System.Threading.Thread.Abort()\r\n   at Program.MyCls..cctor() in c:\\users\\letss\\source\\repos\\ConsoleApp2\\ConsoleApp2\\Program.cs:line 42\r\n   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n   at Program.MyCls..ctor()\r\n   at Program.Main() in c:\\users\\letss\\source\\repos\\ConsoleApp2\\ConsoleApp2\\Program.cs:line 21\r\nAll done\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458842/do-static-constructors-run-as-cers/58459360#58459360","title":"Do static constructors run as CERs?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9661,"user_id":581076,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KQGy0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"tymtam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/581076/tymtam"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571459095,"creation_date":1571459095,"answer_id":58460502,"question_id":58458842,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58460502","body_markdown":"It seems that static constructors are _guaranteed to have completed_, almost. \r\n\r\nStatic constructors can be called explicitly with [`RuntimeHelpers.RunClassConstructor`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.runtime.compilerservices.runtimehelpers.runclassconstructor?view=netframework-4.8) which &#39;_Ensures that the type initializer (also known as a static constructor) for the specified type has been run&#39;_.\r\n\r\nIn your example, the code could be written as follows. \r\n\r\n```\r\nvar t = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n{\r\n  System.Runtime.CompilerServices.RuntimeHelpers.RunClassConstructor(typeof(MyCls).TypeHandle);\r\n  var m = new MyCls();\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n`RunClassConstructor ` calls [`_RunClassConstructor`](https://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/runtime/compilerservices/runtimehelpers.cs,3f64db1811e8b4bb,references) which is annotated with the following comment. \r\n\r\n&gt; In the absence of class constructor deadlock conditions, the call is further guaranteed to have completed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// RunClassConstructor causes the class constructor for the given type to be triggered\r\n// in the current domain.

Earlier post at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4419785/dont-show-python-raise-line-in-the-exception-stack that does not adequately answer this question.\r\n\r\nIn Python 3.7.3 on the Raspberry Pi, (latest available for this platform) raising an exception causes two things to happen:\r\n1.  The actual line of code that raises the exception is listed in the traceback.\r\n2.  Next, the actual exception and text that I want to raise is printed.\r\n\r\nIMHO this is both messy and confusing to a potential user of my code.  Ideally what should happen is that the traceback should identify the exception, and, (if possible) what line of code caused the exception to occur - like the built-in exception handler does.  This is simpler, cleaner, and much easier to understand\r\n\r\n```    throws = (num_throws,)\r\n    if num_die &gt; 5:\r\n        raise ValueError(&#39;num_die should not exceed 5. The value of num_die was: {}&#39;.format(num_die))\r\n    elif num_throws &gt; 20:\r\n        raise ValueError(&#39;num_throws should not exceed 20. The value of num_die was: {}&#39;.format(num_throws))\r\n    elif num_sides == 4 or num_sides == 6 or num_sides == 8 or num_sides == 12 or num_sides == 20:\r\n        return int(num_die), int(num_sides), throws\r\n    else:\r\n        raise ValueError(&#39;A fair die can only have 4, 6, 8, 12, or 20 sides. The number of sides you requested was: {}&#39;.format(num_sides))\r\n```\r\ncauses the following to occur when run:\r\n\r\n```pi@Pi-4Gig:~/Python $ python3 ./Function_Test.py\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;./Function_Test.py&quot;, line 18, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    i = (throw_dice(num_throws=25, num_sides=6))\r\n  File &quot;./Function_Test.py&quot;, line 11, in throw_dice\r\n    raise ValueError(&#39;num_throws should not exceed 20. The value of num_throws was: {}&#39;.format(num_throws))\r\nValueError: num_throws should not exceed 20. The value of num_throws was: 25\r\npi@Pi-4Gig:~/Python $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, the traceback should not include both the line of code that raises the exception.\r\nViz.:\r\n```  File &quot;./Function_Test.py&quot;, line 11, in throw_dice\r\n    raise ValueError(&#39;num_throws should not exceed 20. The value of num_throws was: {}&#39;.format(num_throws))\r\n```\r\nalong with the actual exception that I want to be thrown.\r\nViz.:\r\n\r\nValueError: num_throws should not exceed 20.

But don&#39;t worry&amp;mdash;this should work for any (non-variable-length) array.\r\n\r\nPage 80 of [this draft](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf) of the C standard describes how the `sizeof` operator works:\r\n\r\nIf `sizeof` is given anything besides a variable-length array, it doesn&#39;t evaluate it&amp;mdash;the compiler can find out how big the operand is and it just uses that value.\r\n\r\nSo, after I defined `array` in the example above, the compiler knows that any element of `array` has type &quot;length-_J_ array of length-_K_ array of `some_type_t`&quot; (in other words, `some_type_t[J][K]`). It also knows the values of _J_ and _K_, because they need to be inline constants, so it can determine how big any element of the array is.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it doesn&#39;t matter what index you use to find the size of the element, as long as it is an integer. `sizeof(array[0])` will work just fine with an empty array, as would `sizeof(array[-1])` or `sizeof(array[124124])` (though you should always use 0 to avoid confusing people).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the standard draft even uses it as an example:\r\n\r\n&gt; 6. EXAMPLE 2&amp;emsp;Another use of the `sizeof` operator is to compute the number of elements in an array:\r\n&gt;     ```\r\n&gt;     sizeof array / sizeof array[0]\r\n&gt;     ```\r\n\r\nAnd if the standard suggests it, it&#39;s probably a pretty good way to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458833/iterating-through-a-3d-array/58459046#58459046","title":"Iterating through a 3d array"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11449935,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a7de6d5e23c432f1d87e84815281a114?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nbafanatic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11449935/nbafanatic"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571518520,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571538672,"creation_date":1571437219,"question_id":58458833,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458833","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been trying to use for loops to try to iterate and print out the array.

Packing things into a `[String: Any]` likely loses too much information to be recovered. But your overall goal is certainly possible.\r\n\r\nThe important piece is `input`. Rather than `[String: Any]`, we&#39;re going to use an explicit type, ValueChange:\r\n\r\n    let input = [\r\n        ValueChange(key: &quot;b&quot;, changedTo: &quot;test&quot;),\r\n        ValueChange(key: &quot;c&quot;, changedTo: 2),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nCreating a new type like this allows us to capture all the types, and enforce certain rules, particularly that the values are `Equatable`:\r\n\r\n    struct ValueChange {\r\n        init&lt;Value: Equatable&gt;(key: String, changedTo newValue: Value) {...}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll come back to ValueChange in a moment, but first I want to go back to how it&#39;ll be used. Since you want a `.getDiff(...)` syntax, it&#39;ll be best to create an extension using a protocol:\r\n\r\n    protocol DictionaryDiffComputing {}\r\n    \r\n    extension DictionaryDiffComputing {\r\n        func getDiff(_ changes: [ValueChange]) -&gt; [String: Any] {\r\n            Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:\r\n                changes.compactMap { $0.changedValue(self) })\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe protocol has no requirements. It just exists to say &quot;these types have the `getDiff` method.&quot; This method needs ValueChange to provide us a `(String, Any)` tuple if the value has changed. \r\n\r\nThis is where the problem gets interesting, I&#39;ll just show the answer and then discuss it.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstruct ValueChange {\r\n    let changedValue: (_ object: Any) -&gt; (String, Any)? // (key, newValue)\r\n\r\n    init&lt;Value: Equatable&gt;(key: String, changedTo newValue: Value) {\r\n        self.changedValue = { object in\r\n\r\n            // Get the old value as an Any using Mirror\r\n            guard let oldAnyValue: Any = Mirror(reflecting: object)\r\n                .children\r\n                .first(where: { $0.label == key })?\r\n                .value\r\n                else {\r\n                    assertionFailure(&quot;Unknown key: \\(key)&quot;)\r\n                    return nil\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Make sure it&#39;s the correct type\r\n            guard let oldValue = oldAnyValue as? Value else {\r\n                assertionFailure(&quot;Bad type for values (\\(oldAnyValue)). Expected: \\(Value.self)&quot;)\r\n                return nil\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Compare the values\r\n            return newValue != oldValue ? (key, newValue) : nil\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis uses Mirror to pull out the old value to compare as an Any type, then it converts it to the correct Value type. This is the power of the generic `init`. Since we know the type a compile time, we can capture it inside this closure, erasing that type from the outside world, but being able to work with it at runtime.\r\n\r\n```\r\nextension MyStruct: DictionaryDiffComputing {}\r\nlet myStruct = MyStruct()\r\nmyStruct.getDiff(input) // [&quot;b&quot;: &quot;test&quot;]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I really don&#39;t like about this answer is that it&#39;s very unsafe. Note the two calls to `assertionFailure`. There is nothing about ValueChange that ensures that the key exists or that the value is the correct type. If you change the name or type a property, your program will either crash or behave incorrectly, and there&#39;s nothing the compiler can do to help you.\r\n\r\nYou can make this a lot more type-safe and the code much simpler at the cost of a slightly more verbose calling syntax:\r\n\r\n```\r\nprotocol DictionaryDiffComputing {}\r\n\r\nstruct ValueChange&lt;Root&gt; {\r\n    let changedValue: (_ object: Root) -&gt; (String, Any)? // (key, newValue)\r\n\r\n    init&lt;Value: Equatable&gt;(key: String, keyPath: KeyPath&lt;Root, Value&gt;, changedTo newValue: Value) {\r\n        self.changedValue = { newValue != $0[keyPath: keyPath] ? (key, newValue) : nil }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nextension DictionaryDiffComputing {\r\n    func getDiff(_ changes: [ValueChange&lt;Self&gt;]) -&gt; [String: Any] {\r\n        Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues:\r\n            changes.compactMap { $0.changedValue(self) })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nlet myStruct = MyStruct()\r\n\r\nlet input: [ValueChange&lt;MyStruct&gt;] = [\r\n    ValueChange(key: &quot;b&quot;, keyPath: \\.b, changedTo: &quot;test&quot;),\r\n    ValueChange(key: &quot;c&quot;, keyPath: \\.c, changedTo: 2),\r\n]\r\n\r\nmyStruct.getDiff(input)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you use this approach, you know that the property exists on this type, and that the value is the correct type for that property. You also get some extra power, since you can use any key path you like starting at this root type.

seems that you have not understood correctly what the documentation indicates, let&#39;s analyze each part of the statement:\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n&gt; In multithreaded applications, you can use QTimer in any thread that has an event loop.\r\n\r\n**Where did you use the QTimer is there an event loop?** Yes, you are using the QTimer in the main thread and you have created the event loop through the QXApplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt; To start an event loop from a non-GUI thread, use QThread::exec()\r\n\r\n**Is the main thread a non-GUI thread?** No, so it is not necessary in this case to use QThread to use a QTimer in the main thread.\r\n\r\n**In what cases can QTimer fail?** If the QTimer runs in the main thread and you have not created a QXApplication, or if you run it in a thread where there is no Qt event loop as std::thread.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n**Conclusion:**\r\n\r\nIf the QTimer is used in the main thread, just run the QXApplication, if you want to use it in another thread then you must use QThread.

You can read more about this issue at [this related question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/8864627/3784008).\r\n\r\nYou can get around this by using one of the other available adapters listed at https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/:\r\n\r\n* https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/excon\r\n* https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/patron\r\n* https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/httpclient\r\n\r\nOr external adapters that require another gem:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus\r\n* https://github.com/lostisland/faraday-http\r\n\r\nYour specific implementation of Patron looks correct, so try using one of the other adapters to see if you have any better luck.\r\n\r\n**Update**\r\n\r\nI loaded your updated example and tested it myself. The solution is to use stringified keys. You&#39;re using symbolized keys.\r\n\r\n    # symbolized\r\n    headers = { API_SIGNATURE: &#39;&#39;, API_REQUEST_TIME: &#39;&#39; }\r\n    =&gt; {\r\n           :API_SIGNATURE =&gt; &quot;&quot;,\r\n        :API_REQUEST_TIME =&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis returns:\r\n\r\n    puts conn.headers\r\n    {&quot;Api-Signature&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;Api-Request-Time&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;User-Agent&quot;=&gt;&quot;Faraday v0.17.0&quot;}\r\n\r\nvs:\r\n\r\n    # stringified\r\n    headers = { &#39;API_SIGNATURE&#39; =&gt; &#39;&#39;, &#39;API_REQUEST_TIME&#39; =&gt; &#39;&#39; }\r\n    =&gt; {\r\n           &quot;API_SIGNATURE&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;,\r\n        &quot;API_REQUEST_TIME&quot; =&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow you get the proper values:\r\n\r\n    puts conn.headers\r\n    {&quot;API_SIGNATURE&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;API_REQUEST_TIME&quot;=&gt;&quot;&quot;, &quot;User-Agent&quot;=&gt;&quot;Faraday v0.17.0&quot;}\r\n\r\nAt a glance, your original example _appears_ stringified but is not (which is why I didn&#39;t catch it):\r\n\r\n    {\r\n      &#39;API_SIGNATURE&#39;: &#39;&#39;,\r\n      &#39;API_REQUEST_TIME&#39;: &#39;&#39;\r\n    }\r\n    =&gt; {\r\n           :API_SIGNATURE =&gt; &quot;&quot;,\r\n        :API_REQUEST_TIME =&gt; &quot;&quot;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUsing a colon for your hash key in Ruby automatically makes it a symbol, even if it&#39;s a quoted string. You need to use the hash rocket syntax for stringified keys.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458792/how-to-use-adapter-to-prevent-faraday-from-changing-capitalize-headers/58459132#58459132","title":"How to use adapter to prevent Faraday from changing capitalize headers"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":12212177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EzvZNoo8lnw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reL0EQVRReoRTjaqCkHKh4SO85cSg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12212177","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12212177/user12212177"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":12212177,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-EzvZNoo8lnw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reL0EQVRReoRTjaqCkHKh4SO85cSg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"user12212177","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12212177/user12212177"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58459132,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571442568,"creation_date":1571436808,"last_edit_date":1571442019,"question_id":58458792,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458792","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using Faraday to create an SDK that will interact with an API, and I need to send two headers API_SIGNATURE and API_REQUEST_TIME, so that&#39;s what I&#39;ve created:\r\n\r\n    class APIClient\r\n      def initialize(api_key)\r\n        @api_key = api_key\r\n      end\r\n    \r\n      def get_users\r\n        request.post(&#39;/users&#39;)\r\n      end\r\n    \r\n      private\r\n    \r\n      def request\r\n        Faraday.new(@@BASE_API_URL, headers: headers)\r\n      end\r\n    \r\n      def headers\r\n        timestamp = Time.now.to_i.to_s\r\n        return {\r\n          &#39;API_SIGNATURE&#39;: Digest::MD5.hexdigest(@api_key + timestamp),\r\n          &#39;API_REQUEST_TIME&#39;: timestamp\r\n        }\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd for some reason Faraday is changing `API_SIGNATURE` to `Api-Signature` and `API_REQUEST_TIME` to `Api-Request-Time`.\r\n\r\nI would like to prevent that from happening.

You&#39;ll then need to create a webhook that handles [specific intents](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/intents) for your device:\r\n\r\n* SYNC - return what devices the user has\r\n* QUERY - return the state of devices\r\n* EXECUTE - change the device/trait state\r\n* DISCONNECT - unregister a device\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58458790/deploying-dialogflow-without-asking-it-to-go-into-your-action-first/58495518#58495518","title":"Deploying DialogFlow without asking it to go into your action first?"}],"owner":{"reputation":31,"user_id":1249104,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e57881e3fd2f35fa85ac23a0a2832b85?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Hyperian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1249104/hyperian"},"last_editor":{"reputation":39837,"user_id":1405634,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":63,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/218ed9884ff6fa541a821187836ade50?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Prisoner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1405634/prisoner"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571702539,"creation_date":1571436756,"last_edit_date":1571702539,"question_id":58458790,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58458790","body_markdown":"I have various smart devices where if you say &quot;turn off lights&quot;, it will just turn off my smart lights.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m learning to make my own agent on dialogflow but to run my test app in the simulator, I always have to type in &quot;talk to my test app&quot; first.

This seems to be a known issue since arrays are objects and the indices are essentially keys in the object code.\r\n\r\nWrong. All engines, including V8 do not use &quot;objects&quot; (meaning: a list of key value pairs) to represent arrays, but use some specialized datastructures depending on the way you use the array.\r\n\r\n&gt; If I simply put constants in for slope and offset, the code is ~25 times faster.\r\n\r\nRight. Constants can be inlined. No calculation is faster than a calculation. \r\n\r\n&gt; Pretty shocked that array/object lookup is so slow. \r\n\r\n*How slow?*.
