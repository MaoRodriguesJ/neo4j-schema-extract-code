As a heads up, you must be an administration on the repository to setup required status checks for a repository.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938059/git-enforce-pull-before-merge/57939648#57939648","title":"Git: Enforce pull before merge"}],"owner":{"reputation":154,"user_id":8401651,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1656303c3452903b5241e20321c4eb46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jalil Compaor&#233;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8401651/jalil-compaor%c3%a9"},"last_editor":{"reputation":154,"user_id":8401651,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1656303c3452903b5241e20321c4eb46?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jalil Compaor&#233;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8401651/jalil-compaor%c3%a9"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939648,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568499119,"creation_date":1568484542,"last_edit_date":1568486393,"question_id":57938059,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938059","body_markdown":"Sometimes, in my team, a developer will forget to pull from master before merging.

have a misunderstanding about something in angular, this problem repeated with me after I need to render something after the HTTP response.\r\nI built my project with angular 6, and I am using `HttpClient` to request the server and after the response, I do some logic.\r\nand I am using FormBuilder to bind data.\r\nThe problem is, after getting the response data I want to bind this data in the template, the data does not render on the page until the user clicks on any control in the page!\r\n\r\nI have tried many solutions but still, the problem not solved so after a search I know that HttpClient return an Observable data and it is working async so I trying to await the response but also this not working. \r\n\r\nThis is my generic HTTP service code :\r\n\r\n\r\n    private token:

the geometry is clipped, according to the clip space coordinate (`gl_Position`). The clip space coordinate is a [Homogeneous coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogeneous_coordinates). The condition for a homogeneous coordinate to be in clip space is:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\n-w &lt;=  x, y, z  &lt;= w.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe clip space coordinate is transformed to a [Cartesian coordinate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system) in normalized device space, by [Perspective divide](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Post-Processing#Perspective_divide):\r\n\r\n```lang_non\r\nndc_position = gl_Position.xyz / gl_Position.w\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe normalized device space is a cube, with the left bottom front of (-1, -1, -1) and the right top back of (1, 1, 1).\r\n\r\nThe x and y component of the normalized device space coordinate is linear mapped to the viewport, which is set by `gl.viewport` (See [WebGL Viewport](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#2.3)). The viewport is a rectangle with an origin (`x`, `y`) and a `width` and a `height`:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\nxw = (ndc_position.x + 1) * (width / 2) + x\r\nyw = (ndc_position.y + 1) * (height / 2 ) + y \r\n```\r\n\r\n`xw` and `yw` can be accessed by `gl_FragCoord.xy` in the fragment shader.\r\n\r\nThe z component of the normalized device space coordinate is linear mapped to the depth range, which is by default [0.0, 1.0], but can be set by `gl.depthRange`. See [Viewport Depth Range](https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/specs/latest/1.0/#6.14). The depth range consists of a `near` value and a `far` value. `far` has to be greater than `near` and both values have to be in [0.0, 1.0]:\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\ndepth = (ndc_position.z + 1) * (far-near) / 2 + near\r\n``` \r\n\r\nThe `depth` can be accessed by `gl_FragCoord.z` in the fragment shader.\r\n\r\nAll this operations are done automatically in the rendering pipeline and are part of the Vertex Post-Processing.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938025/how-does-a-camera-convert-from-clip-space-into-screen-space/57938288#57938288","title":"How Does a camera convert from

is no predictable point when the destructor is called. The memory is managed by the [garbage collector][1]:\r\n\r\n&gt; Garbage collection occurs when one of the following conditions is\r\n&gt; true:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The system has low physical memory. This is detected by either the low memory notification from the OS or low memory indicated by the\r\n&gt; host.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The memory that is used by allocated objects on the managed heap surpasses an acceptable threshold. This threshold is continuously\r\n&gt; adjusted as the process runs.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; - The GC.Collect method is called. In almost all cases, you do not have to call this method, because the garbage collector runs\r\n&gt; continuously. This method is primarily used for unique situations and\r\n&gt; testing.\r\n\r\nSo usually you are not interested when this happens, just that it happens.

The complaint is:\r\n\r\n&gt; Property &#39;param&#39; of exported class expression may not be private or protected.\r\n\r\nMy approaches to solve the problem:\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I intentionally returned class expression instead of class declaration, because there would be an error about [exporting private names](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/6307#issuecomment-168273343).\r\n\r\nOkay so lets make `param` public (in fact returned class may not have private/protected anything, though if you leave constructor private it becomes public in emitted declarations (maybe bug)) and yay, it compiles!\r\n\r\nHowever, the new problem is: since `Foo&lt;T&gt;` is generic and not in the global scope, I cannot use its symbol to type things:\r\n```ts\r\nexport type IFooClass = ReturnType&lt;typeof createFooClass&gt;;\r\n\r\nexport type IFoo&lt;T&gt; = InstanceType&lt;IFooClass&gt; /* how do I pass T here? */;\r\n```\r\nSo I am left with `IFoo&lt;T&gt;` being just `Foo&lt;any&gt;`.\r\n\r\nOkay then, let&#39;s declare some interfaces (yay, boilerplates):\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport interface IFoo&lt;T&gt; { \r\n    getT(): T;\r\n}\r\nexport interface IFooClass {\r\n    factory&lt;T&gt;(t: T): IFoo&lt;T&gt;;\r\n}\r\nexport createFooClass = (dep: IDep): IFooClass =&gt; class Foo&lt;T&gt; { /* ... */ }; \r\n```\r\nBut interfaces duplicate code and use structural typing which can blow things since it doesn&#39;t reflect private properties on ojbects.\r\n\r\nYes, I could use some [phantom symbol tagging](https://github.com/Veetaha/ts-typedefs/blob/d68f729aa1dec26648b05c0a4fd6dc41841d0661/lib/types/tag.ts#L41) to bring nominal typing, but then I will have to do a lot of type casts inside of `Foo&lt;T&gt;` implementation if I want it to explicitly implement `IFooClass`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938015/how-to-export-generic-class-factory-function-with-declaration","title":"How to export generic class factory function with --declaration"},{"tags":["javascript","html","dom"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":789,"user_id":2244284,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4897e73ee56878f68a7d0b5902d2fe98?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gavin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2244284/gavin"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568484279,"post_id":57938013,"comment_id":102291806,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938013/is-it-possible-to-remove-the-child-elements-of-the-ul-i-have-with-my-code#comment102291806_57938013"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":301,"user_id":8665051,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jwvnz.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ibrahim Hasnat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8665051/ibrahim-hasnat"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568484580,"creation_date":1568484580,"answer_id":57938065,"question_id":57938013,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938065","body_markdown":"Try this.

I store this on google.com, and retrieve this on yahoo.com) with `var dexieDB = GM.getValue(&#39;unique-dexie-db-name&#39;);` My returned object value is not a Dexie database object, but rather something else I can&#39;t use as a database.\r\n\r\nMy question: I&#39;m unsure, but I think when storing this Dexie Database into TamperMonkey, it gets stored as a string, and, I should try to somehow `JSON.stringify()` the object fully in order to be able to reproduce and re-create it when I need it in the `GM.getValue()` call. How do I store this Javascript object as a string in order to be able to retrieve the value again as a whole later?\r\n\r\nThis is my working example code;\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/n-bell/b375c80b638d3a59a250e903afb4a36b.js\r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/n-bell/b375c80b638d3a59a250e903afb4a36b\r\n\r\n(second link looks better formatted in browser)\r\n\r\nAnd, as stated before, I&#39;ve tried playing around with `JSON.parse()` / `JSON.stringify()` but I&#39;m not sure this is the path to go down.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/q/57929417/6393165\r\n  [2]: https://dexie.org/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938009/reopen-dexie-database-with-tampermonkey","title":"Reopen Dexie Database with Tampermonkey"},{"tags":["python","pip","anaconda","conda"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":9884,"user_id":999924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44b219232560d6f33b5b24b80d30e43c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/999924/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568484529,"post_id":57938007,"comment_id":102291860,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938007/ssl-sertificate-problem-while-using-pip-in-conda-environment#comment102291860_57938007"},{"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":1443993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b1b357a95d2b94fa475afb82d2db3c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1443993","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1443993/user1443993"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":9884,"user_id":999924,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44b219232560d6f33b5b24b80d30e43c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/999924/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568485665,"post_id":57938007,"comment_id":102292119,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57938007/ssl-sertificate-problem-while-using-pip-in-conda-environment#comment102292119_57938007"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":1443993,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b1b357a95d2b94fa475afb82d2db3c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1443993","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1443993/user1443993"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4952,"user_id":5012099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a24d87840141459cef20b2877bcd9bc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"FlyingTeller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5012099/flyingteller"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":53,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568644607,"creation_date":1568484094,"last_edit_date":1568644607,"question_id":57938007,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57938007","body_markdown":"**OC: MS Windows 10 Professional**\r\n\r\n**conda: 4.7.11**\r\n\r\n**pip: 19.2.2**\r\n\r\n**python: 3.7.4**\r\n\r\n**cuda: 10.1.168**\r\n\r\nNeed to install pycuda in isolated conda environment.

to the clarifications in the comment section, I would do it like below. I assume, that you have an array with data objects. This array is displayed in its entirety when there are no filters in the `filters` array. If there are any filters in it, it will only display the filtered items. There is a computed property which returns always the relevant set of items.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added two computed properties which return possible attribute values. So, if there is an `animalType` property in the object, every possible value of this `animalType` is retrieved from the data. This is done with each property for all the data items. Boolean values are filtered out.\r\n\r\nWhen using boolean values, not the value is important but the key. So, similarly to every other property, each key (instead of their values) is returned for booleans.\r\n\r\nThose two arrays are then used to filter the effective data. The filtering is still by value (comparison with `===`). So, if you are having an object as an attribute value, this won&#39;t work (except it has the same object reference..)\r\n\r\nHere is also a [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ssc-hrep3/pen/zYOLpQb) to try it out.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false runnable: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;template&gt;\r\n      &lt;ul&gt;\r\n        &lt;li v-for=&quot;item in filteredData&quot;&gt;\r\n          {{ item }}\r\n        &lt;/li&gt;\r\n      &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    export default {\r\n      data () {\r\n        return {\r\n          data: [{\r\n            name: &#39;Kitty&#39;,\r\n            animalType: &#39;cat&#39;,\r\n            test: 123,\r\n            booleantest: true\r\n          }, {\r\n            name: &#39;Bello&#39;,\r\n            animalType: &#39;dog&#39;\r\n          }, {\r\n            name: &#39;Bobby&#39;,\r\n            animalType: &#39;gorilla&#39;,\r\n            booleantest: false\r\n          }],\r\n          filters: [&#39;dog&#39;, &#39;booleantest&#39;]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      computed: {\r\n        filteredData () {\r\n          return this.data.filter(item =&gt; {\r\n            if (this.filters.length === 0) {\r\n              return true;\r\n            }\r\n        \r\n            let showItem = false;\r\n            this.allObjectPropertiesWithoutBooleans.forEach(property =&gt; {\r\n              if (item[property] !== undefined &amp;&amp; this.filters.includes(item[property])) {\r\n                showItem = true;\r\n                console.debug(`The item ${JSON.stringify(item)} contains the property &quot;${property}&quot; with the value &quot;${item[property]}&quot; which is also in the filters array.`);\r\n              }\r\n            });\r\n            this.allBooleanObjectProperties.forEach(property =&gt; {\r\n              if (item[property] === true &amp;&amp; this.filters.includes(property)) {\r\n                showItem = true;\r\n                console.debug(`The item ${JSON.stringify(item)} contains the boolean property &quot;${property}&quot; which is &quot;true&quot; and is also in the filters array.`)\r\n              }\r\n            });\r\n            return showItem;\r\n          });\r\n        },\r\n        allObjectPropertiesWithoutBooleans () {\r\n          const objectProperties = {};\r\n          this.data.forEach(item =&gt; {\r\n            Object.keys(item).filter(property =&gt; item[property] !== true &amp;&amp; item[property] !== false).forEach(property =&gt; {\r\n              objectProperties[property] = true;\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n          return Object.keys(objectProperties);\r\n        },\r\n        allBooleanObjectProperties () {\r\n          const objectProperties = {};\r\n          this.data.forEach(item =&gt; {\r\n            Object.keys(item).filter(property =&gt; item[property] === true || item[property] === false).forEach(property =&gt; {\r\n              objectProperties[property] = true;\r\n            });\r\n          });\r\n          return Object.keys(objectProperties);\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    };\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937977/filtering-through-objects-with-provided-values/57938876#57938876","title":"Filtering through objects with provided values"}],"owner":{"reputation":683,"user_id":4108300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f4f81b4ba926a948950d8abe79da27b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4108300/kira"},"last_editor":{"reputation":683,"user_id":4108300,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9f4f81b4ba926a948950d8abe79da27b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kira","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4108300/kira"},"comment_count":11,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57938876,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568572767,"creation_date":1568483901,"last_edit_date":1568484987,"question_id":57937977,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937977","body_markdown":"I have a json of data and a few checkboxes that should filter out data based on checked items.

I am quite new in the world of Vue and js in general, be kind.\r\n\r\nHere is my half-working code\r\n\r\n```\r\nthis.getCurrentAds.map(ad =&gt; {\r\n        Object.values(ad).filter(field =&gt; {\r\n          this.checkedFilters.map(filter =&gt; {\r\n            if (field === filter) {\r\n              console.log(&quot;Match&quot;, field);\r\n            }\r\n          });\r\n        });\r\n      });\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937977/filtering-through-objects-with-provided-values","title":"Filtering through objects with provided values"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":30743,"user_id":7505395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4t4nq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Patrick Artner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7505395/patrick-artner"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1568484504,"post_id":57937975,"comment_id":102291851,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937975/check-the-lexicographic-order-of-two-strings-in-python#comment102291851_57937975"},{"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":2001701,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/11700133692f8815d260f82402dc87fa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"etotheipi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2001701/etotheipi"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":30743,"user_id":7505395,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4t4nq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Patrick Artner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7505395/patrick-artner"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568560581,"post_id":57937975,"comment_id":102304457,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937975/check-the-lexicographic-order-of-two-strings-in-python#comment102304457_57937975"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":847,"user_id":6476496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fd1ca185cf4b12910506f46f431d2371?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"kingkupps","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6476496/kingkupps"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568484040,"creation_date":1568484040,"answer_id":57937996,"question_id":57937975,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57937996","body_markdown":"You are missing a return on this line: `lexico(str1[1:],str2[1:])`.

This code should stop the training from being added (create a conflict object):\r\n\r\n    $conflictRevision = Revision::where(&#39;fk_motorbike&#39;, $fk_motorbike)\r\n        -&gt;whereDate(&#39;date_revision_start&#39;, &quot;&lt;=&quot; , $date_start)\r\n        -&gt;whereDate(&#39;date_revision_end&#39;, &quot;&gt;=&quot;, $date_start)\r\n        -&gt;where(&#39;hour_start&#39;, &quot;&lt;=&quot; , $request-&gt;get(&#39;hour_start&#39;))  \r\n        -&gt;where(&#39;hour_end&#39;, &quot;&gt;=&quot; , $request-&gt;get(&#39;hour_end&#39;))\r\n        -&gt;first();\r\nA few things may be allowing the training to be recorded.  \r\n\r\n 1. are you sure the $fk_motorbike is correctly entered into that query (same bike, and value is transferred from the from)?\r\n 2. is the revision entered into the database already?  IE is the form on your page actually the way you have it where a user can enter the training *first*?  If so, and the revision is getting entered after the training, then there is no revision yet created to compare against with the training query.\r\n 3. are all of the dates and hours in the correct format to compare against the database formats?  IE is the query failing because the form is sending in a different format from the DB and thus the comparison fails?  Do you need to parse anything to match?\r\n\r\nA potentially bigger issue, however, is that while your code *to block* seems correct, the logic of this architecture *for the reverse* (don&#39;t block if the time is outside the revision) seems like it needs attention.  Because the revision may span several days, I not sure it makes sense to have the time on the revision unless it is ONLY down for revision during those times, and then available for the rest of the day.  Not sure what the point of tracking the hours of revision is, if it is a multiple day outage.  \r\n\r\nAs an example, if the bike is down 10/9 - 15/9 10:00-11:00, and I want a training on 12/9 at 14:00, the query above will NOT show a conflict and WILL allow the training.  Because the bike shows it is only in revision for 1 hour every day that week.  Is that what you want?  If not, it may make more sense to remove the hours from the revision, since it is spanning multiple days. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937954/check-and-compare-the-dates-before-planning/57938752#57938752","title":"Check and compare the dates before planning"}],"owner":{"reputation":531,"user_id":11124425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3c1f209fe0adc4c409a1bde885a09f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11124425","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11124425/user11124425"},"last_editor":{"reputation":531,"user_id":11124425,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3c1f209fe0adc4c409a1bde885a09f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11124425","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11124425/user11124425"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568497313,"creation_date":1568483680,"last_edit_date":1568497313,"question_id":57937954,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937954","body_markdown":"I planned a training date on 10/09/2019\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nMy problem is that when I planned a revision for example on 09/09/2019 to 11/09/2019.\r\nI can add one recording , I would like to make one blocking...

designing a system that receives a file and runs several CPU intensive\r\nanalysis engines on it (5 engines). \r\nIn the current design:\r\n\r\n- The file is sent by a producer thread to the analysis engines via 5 [task queues][1] (every engine has its task queue)\r\n- The producer thread is busy waiting by querying the status of each one of the 5 tasks until all of them are ready.\r\n- Once ready, it pulls the results, combines them into one result object with some logic and writes it into a database.\r\n\r\nWhat will be the best way to handle the results without busy waiting on the producer? so I can decouple the producing of the job, handling its results and also be more fault tolerant to producer crash.\r\nIs there any other better way to design this? \r\n\r\nMaybe via results queue?(If this is the case how to dispatch the handler only when all the tasks are ready), I saw there is a sub-tasks concept in celery, but i&#39;m not using [celery][2] because it prevents creating

The largest portion of the design involves creating engaging puzzles that the user can sort through. The puzzle design isn&#39;t the issue I have currently, however.\r\n\r\nWhile my initial idea was to have each &quot;problem&quot; have an array of expected answers to check the user&#39;s answer against, the CS department head at my school (who runs the senior seminar) recommended I use embedded Python instead, he recommend both to challenge me, and to make it easier on the data to embed a simple interpreter that will check user code output against the expected output. \r\n\r\nFast-forward four weeks, and I&#39;ve learned a lot about how Python actually works. I even got the interpreter to *simple C strings* as python code, things like print(&quot;hello&quot;) or print(&quot;hello/tworld&quot;), so long as there is no white space in the C string. \r\n\r\nThat code looks like   \r\n\r\n    #include &quot;pch.h&quot;\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;Python.h&gt;\r\n    \r\n    void exec_pycode(const char* code);\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n    \tusing namespace std;\r\n    \tPy_Initialize();\r\n    \r\n    \tstring input;\r\n    \r\n    \tcin &gt;&gt; input;\r\n    \t /*Though the variable gets passed to a const char* definition,\r\n    \tthe pointer is constant over the character, because the pointer ALWAYS points\r\n    \tto the same function*/\r\n    \tchar const *PyCode = input.data();\r\n    \r\n    \texec_pycode(PyCode);    \t\r\n    \r\n    \tPy_Finalize();\r\n    \treturn EXIT_SUCCESS;    \r\n    }        \r\n    \r\n    //The execution of python code as a simple string in C and interpreting in python\r\n    void exec_pycode(const char* code)\r\n    {\r\n        Py_Initialize();\r\n        PyRun_SimpleString(code);\r\n        Py_Finalize();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMy next step I decided was to get strings like print(&quot;hello world&quot;) white space included, readable as Python code.\r\n\r\nI have tried to change the exec code function to look like\r\n\r\n    void exec_pycode(const char* code)\r\n    {\r\n    \tPy_Initialize();\r\n    \tconst char *inFile = &quot;FileName&quot;;\r\n    \tPyObject *dict = PyDict_New();\r\n    \tPy_CompileString(code, inFile, Py_file_input);\r\n    \tPyRun_String(code, Py_file_input, dict, dict);\r\n    \r\n    \tPy_Finalize();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis compiles fine when the function is changed like this, but when I input any string, simple or with white space, the program exits with a return value of 0 with out printing any of the python code. \r\n\r\nI am curious why this is occurring, whether I&#39;m having issues converting the user input to an adequate C string to read as a Python code, or it is not understanding the declaration of `Py_CompileString(const char *str, const char *filename, int start)` or `PyRun_String(const char *str, int start, PyObject *globals, PyObject *locals)`, [I have stared at this documentation, taken notes, diagrammed, and I still get the same exit condition][1].\r\n\r\n I&#39;m also wondering: \r\n\r\n1. If I&#39;m declaring the dictionary for the Python string commands to read the code properly, or if it&#39;s \r\n2. If by having my Python file flags set to `NULL` in the simplified version instead of `Py_CompileStrngFlags(...)` or `Py_RunStringFlags(...)` that it&#39;s what&#39;s causing the return value of NULL issue I&#39;m experiencing.\r\n3. If I&#39;m even using the right function to run embedded Python with user input.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context, RequestDelegate next)\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            await next(context);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception ex)\r\n        {\r\n

the debugger doesn&#39;t break when an exception happens, but is just handled in the middleware and execution continues. However, I want the debugger to break at the place the exception is thrown, when it&#39;s not caught by anything but this middleware. **How do I achieve this?**\r\n\r\nI actually tried not adding this middleware when running locally. E.g. doing the following in Startup.cs:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// I&#39;m setting env to &quot;none&quot; when running locally\r\nif (!env.IsEnvironment(&quot;none&quot;))\r\n{\r\n    app.UseMiddleware&lt;ExceptionHandlingMiddleware&gt;();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this seems to just cause the frontend to act differently - understandably as it&#39;s not receiving a readable JSON-object, but it makes me think the problem is not my middleware. I&#39;d prefer to keep this middleware active but if that&#39;s not possible while getting the debugger to break properly I guess I can live with that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937900/break-on-exception-even-with-exception-handling-middleware","title":"Break on exception even with exception handling middleware"},{"tags":["java","system.out"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":164165,"user_id":2970947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAq55.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Elliott Frisch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970947/elliott-frisch"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568483753,"post_id":57937898,"comment_id":102291691,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937898/how-to-get-system-out-console-from-a-jar-loaded-by-a-class-loader#comment102291691_57937898"},{"owner":{"reputation":267,"user_id":6496267,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c21d8d6c004c9dd7f3a714ecb7e0e830?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6496267/john"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":164165,"user_id":2970947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAq55.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Elliott Frisch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970947/elliott-frisch"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568483887,"post_id":57937898,"comment_id":102291722,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937898/how-to-get-system-out-console-from-a-jar-loaded-by-a-class-loader#comment102291722_57937898"},{"owner":{"reputation":48352,"user_id":2071828,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/R8AYO.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Boris the Spider","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2071828/boris-the-spider"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568486407,"post_id":57937898,"comment_id":102292300,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937898/how-to-get-system-out-console-from-a-jar-loaded-by-a-class-loader#comment102292300_57937898"},{"owner":{"reputation":164165,"user_id":2970947,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HAq55.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Elliott Frisch","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970947/elliott-frisch"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568507358,"post_id":57937898,"comment_id":102295602,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937898/how-to-get-system-out-console-from-a-jar-loaded-by-a-class-loader#comment102295602_57937898"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1017,"user_id":315454,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7539799687d4b53ef900f8b12896a64f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander.Furer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/315454/alexander-furer"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1568485898,"creation_date":1568485898,"answer_id":57938215,"question_id":57937898,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57938215","body_markdown":"System.out is per process, no way to have different stream per class loader.

you are doing in your code... when using an ORM, the general idea is to help us, not only connect to the database, or not writing any SQL, or protect from SQL injection, but mostly be easy to use and change...\r\n\r\nwith that in mind, always do this when using Sequelize:\r\n\r\n - create a `models` folder in your project\r\n - add an `index.js` inside that folder with:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;);\r\nconst path = require(&#39;path&#39;);\r\nconst Sequelize = require(&#39;sequelize&#39;);\r\nconst _ = require(&#39;lodash&#39;);\r\n\r\nconst db = {};\r\nconst sequelize = new Sequelize(process.env.DB_DATABASE, process.env.DB_USER, process.env.DB_PWD, {\r\n  host: process.env.DB_HOST,\r\n  dialect: &#39;mysql&#39;,\r\n  logging: process.env.APP_ENVIRONMENT !== &#39;local&#39; ? null : console.log,\r\n  pool: {\r\n    max: 5,\r\n    min: 0,\r\n    idle: 10000,\r\n  },\r\n  operatorsAliases: false,\r\n});\r\n\r\n// add all models\r\nfs.readdirSync(__dirname)\r\n  .filter(file =&gt; file.indexOf(&#39;.&#39;) !== 0 &amp;&amp; file !== &#39;index.js&#39; &amp;&amp; file.slice(-3) === &#39;.js&#39;)\r\n  .forEach(file =&gt; {\r\n    const model = sequelize.import(path.join(__dirname, file));\r\n    db[model.name] = model;\r\n  });\r\n\r\n// add all associations\r\nObject.keys(db).forEach(modelName =&gt; {\r\n  if (&#39;associate&#39; in db[modelName]) {\r\n    db[modelName].associate(db);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = _.extend(\r\n  {\r\n    sequelize,\r\n    Sequelize,\r\n  },\r\n  db\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow, add a file per database model, let&#39;s imagine a `logs` table you might have:\r\n\r\ncalled it `logs.js` and put inside the `models` folder, together with the `index.js`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nmodule.exports = (sequelize, DataTypes) =&gt; {\r\n  const model = sequelize.define(\r\n    &#39;external_logs&#39;,\r\n    {\r\n      id: {\r\n        type: DataTypes.INTEGER.UNSIGNED,\r\n        primaryKey: true,\r\n        autoIncrement: true,\r\n        allowNull: false,\r\n      },\r\n      engine: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: false },\r\n      response_code: { type: DataTypes.INTEGER.UNSIGNED, allowNull: true },\r\n      origin: { type: DataTypes.STRING, allowNull: true },\r\n      created_at: {\r\n        type: DataTypes.DATE,\r\n        allowNull: false,\r\n        defaultValue: sequelize.literal(&#39;CURRENT_TIMESTAMP&#39;),\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      timestamps: false,\r\n      tableName: &#39;frontend_api_external_logs&#39;,\r\n    }\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  model.associate = models =&gt; {\r\n    model.belongsTo(models.campaigns, {\r\n      foreignKey: &#39;campaign_id&#39;,\r\n      allowNull: false,\r\n      onDelete: &#39;cascade&#39;,\r\n      onUpdate: &#39;cascade&#39;,\r\n    });\r\n    model.belongsTo(models.external_audit, {\r\n      foreignKey: &#39;audit_id&#39;,\r\n      allowNull: false,\r\n      onDelete: &#39;cascade&#39;,\r\n      onUpdate: &#39;cascade&#39;,\r\n    });\r\n  };\r\n\r\n  return model;\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can see, you can easily create associations with other models very easy, without the need to import any file, and you can then call this model, by the definition you specified, in this case: `external_logs` ... though the real table name is called, as you can see: `frontend_api_external_logs`\r\n\r\n\r\nif you end up needed to call any model or perform any database task, all you need is to call that `index.js` file, and not only the database, but also all models with their own associations will be available as well... for example, in a `utilities` folder, with  a `database.js` file, the `database.js` could simply have:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst db = require(&#39;./../models&#39;); // same as &#39;./../models/index&#39;\r\n\r\nconst logApiCall = (action, description) =&gt; {\r\n   const logRow = {\r\n       // content of the external logs table\r\n       external_audit: {\r\n           // content of the audit table as there&#39;s an association\r\n       }\r\n   }; // the content\r\n   db.external_logs\r\n      .create(logRow, { include: db.external_audit })\r\n        // inserted\r\n      })\r\n      .catch(err =&gt; {\r\n        // NOT inserted\r\n        logger.log(`AUDIT ERROR: ${err.message}`);\r\n        utilities.slack.sendMessage({ action, description, error: err.message });\r\n      });\r\n};\r\n\r\nexports.logCall = logApiCall;\r\n```\r\n\r\nand this makes it even easier to perform logs with audits to any action performed by the users, and it will as simple as:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst db = require(&#39;./../utilities/database&#39;);\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\ndb.logCall(&#39;my action&#39;, &#39;my description&#39;);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can see, I don&#39;t need to worry about what models my file is (no need to require each model I&#39;m using) and I simply call one file that handles all.\r\n\r\nthis is what I&#39;ve been using since I&#39;ve started to use Sequielize (when there was only v2 available) and I&#39;ve been &quot;upgrading&quot; the `index.js` file when they bump versions, but this one is the exact same for ev4 and the new v5... \r\n\r\ngive it a try and I&#39;m sure it will help you along your Sequielize projects...\r\n\r\nin a new project of mine:\r\n\r\n![](https://i.postimg.cc/gkDzM0tP/screenshot-644.png)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937893/sequelize-orm-cant-use-sync/57939135#57939135","title":"Sequelize ORM can&#39;t use sync()"}],"owner":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":4001324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73330a07ee52d37d1c9606b73728a175?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shane G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001324/shane-g"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1111,"user_id":4001324,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/73330a07ee52d37d1c9606b73728a175?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Shane G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4001324/shane-g"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":57939135,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568493926,"creation_date":1568483246,"last_edit_date":1568483597,"question_id":57937893,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937893","body_markdown":"This is an extract from a file that uses db as the variable from the db.js file, which is the file which connects to the database.

out the below example.\r\n\r\nAll the magic happens inside `to_num()`, which will handle white space before and after the number.\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;sstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;tuple&gt;\r\n    \r\n    auto to_num(const std::string&amp; s)\r\n    {\r\n        std::istringstream is(s);\r\n        int n;\r\n        bool good = (is &gt;&gt; std::ws &gt;&gt; n) &amp;&amp; (is &gt;&gt; std::ws).eof();\r\n    \r\n        return std::make_tuple(n, good);\r\n    };\r\n    \r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n        int n;\r\n        bool good;\r\n    \r\n        std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter value: &quot;;\r\n        for(;;)\r\n        {\r\n            std::string s;\r\n            std::getline(std::cin, s);\r\n    \r\n            std::tie(n, good) = to_num(s);\r\n            if(good) break;\r\n    \r\n            std::cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; &quot; is not an integral number&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;\r\n

}\r\n\r\nExplanation of what&#39;s going on inside `to_num()`:\r\n\r\n1. `(is &gt;&gt; std::ws &gt;&gt; n)` extracts (optional) leading white space and an integer from `is`. In the boolean context `is`&#39;s [operator bool()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_ios/operator_bool) will kick in and return true if the extraction was successful.\r\n\r\n2. `(is &gt;&gt; std::ws).eof()` extracts (optional) trailing white space and will return true if there is no garbage at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nHere is a slightly cleaner version that uses [Structured binding declaration](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/structured_binding) and [Class template argument deduction](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/class_template_argument_deduction) available in c++17:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;sstream&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;tuple&gt;\r\n    \r\n    auto to_num(const std::string&amp; s)\r\n    {\r\n        std::istringstream is(s);\r\n        int n;\r\n        bool good = (is &gt;&gt; std::ws &gt;&gt; n) &amp;&amp; (is &gt;&gt; std::ws).eof();\r\n    \r\n        return std::tuple(n, good);

the time of writing, the QLDB Node.js driver is still in development. It is going to be fairly difficult if you try and create one yourself, so I would caution against doing so. That said, I can explain both the purpose and algorithm behind CommitDigest.\r\n \r\nThe purpose is fairly straight-forward: to ensure that transactions are only committed iff the server has processed the exact set of statements sent by the client (all, in order, no duplicates). HTTP is request-response and it is therefore possible that requests may be dropped, processed out of order or duplicated. The QLDB drivers manage the communication with QLDB correctly, but having commit digest being in the protocol makes it impossible for an implementation to incorrectly retry requests and still commit the transaction. For example, consider incrementing a bank balance twice because a HTTP message is retried even though the first request succeeded.\r\n \r\nThe algorithm is also pretty straight-forward: a hash value is seeded with the transaction id and then updated with the QLDB ‘dot’ operator. Each update ‘dots’ in the statement hash (sha256 of the PartiQL string) as well as the [IonHash][1] of all of the bind values. The dot operator is the way QLDB merges hash values (this is the same operator used in the [verification APIs][2]) and is defined as the hash of the concatenation of the two hashes, ordered by the (signed, little-endian) byte-wise comparison between the two hashes. The client and server run this algorithm in lock-step and the server will only process the commit command if the value the client passes matches what the server computed. In this way, the server will never commit a transaction that isn’t exactly what the client requested.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://amzn.github.io/ion-hash/\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-qldb-dmv-sample-java/blob/master/src/main/java/software/amazon/qldb/tutorial/Verifier.java#L130-L159","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937869/how-to-get-compute-commitdigest-when-committing-a-transaction-in-aws-qldb/57964721#57964721","title":"How to get/compute CommitDigest when committing a transaction in AWS QLDB?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":245,"user_id":1012465,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TdX5Y.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Alko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1012465/alko"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570436812,"post_id":58062736,"comment_id":102899340,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937869/how-to-get-compute-commitdigest-when-committing-a-transaction-in-aws-qldb/58062736#comment102899340_58062736"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":1545872,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/refDU.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"FroiD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1545872/froid"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569242603,"creation_date":1569242603,"answer_id":58062736,"question_id":57937869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58062736","body_markdown":"I have not enough reputation to add a comment, but I found this library here might help: https://github.com/amzn/ion-hash-js\r\n\r\nI&#39;m now here:\r\n```\r\nconst ionHashJS = require(&quot;ion-hash-js/dist/commonjs/es5/src/IonHash&quot;);\r\nconst ionStr =\r\n  &quot;INSERT INTO Vehicle { &#39;VIN&#39;: &#39;12345&#39;, &#39;Type&#39;: &#39;Semi&#39;, &#39;Year&#39;: &#39;2020&#39;, &#39;Make&#39;: &#39;Frank&#39;, &#39;Model&#39;: &#39;313373&#39;, &#39;Color&#39;: &#39;Blue&#39;  }&quot;;\r\nconst hashReader = ionHashJS.makeHashReader(\r\n  ionJs.makeReader(ionStr),\r\n  ionHashJS.cryptoIonHasherProvider(&quot;sha256&quot;)\r\n);\r\nhashReader.next();\r\nhashReader.next();\r\nconst digest = hashReader.digest();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57937869/how-to-get-compute-commitdigest-when-committing-a-transaction-in-aws-qldb/58062736#58062736","title":"How to get/compute CommitDigest when committing a transaction in AWS QLDB?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4035,"user_id":841832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/icYx2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mike Richards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/841832/mike-richards"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4035,"user_id":841832,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/icYx2.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mike Richards","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/841832/mike-richards"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":524,"favorite_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":7,"protected_date":1569736457,"answer_count":2,"score":7,"last_activity_date":1569780286,"creation_date":1568482971,"last_edit_date":1568493785,"question_id":57937869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57937869","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve been reading through the docs trying to figure out how to commit a transaction in QLDB, and in order to do so, a `CommitDigest` is required, and the docs describe it as:\r\n\r\n&gt; Specifies the commit digest for the transaction to commit.
