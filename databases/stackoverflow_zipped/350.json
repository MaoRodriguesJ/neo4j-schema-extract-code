dynamoDB\r\n- one which tests I can search by eventId\r\n- one which tests I can search by other attributes\r\n\r\nFor the first test file, I run a beforeAll() which should clear anything that might be in the table:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeforeAll(async () =&gt; {\r\n    jest.setTimeout(JEST_TIMEOUT);\r\n    \r\n    await clearDb(eventA)\r\n    await clearDb(eventB)\r\n    await clearDb(eventC)\r\n

clearDb(response.data)\r\n        })\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd file, I again clear any mock events that may be in there and populate with one event:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeforeAll(async () =&gt; {\r\n    jest.setTimeout(JEST_TIMEOUT);\r\n\r\n    await clearDb(eventA)\r\n    await clearDb(eventB)\r\n    await clearDb(eventC)\r\n\r\n    await populateDb(eventA)\r\n});\r\n\r\n// run tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd in the third file, I again clear all events and populate with 3 events:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbeforeAll(async () =&gt; {\r\n    jest.setTimeout(JEST_TIMEOUT);\r\n\r\n    await clearDb(eventA)\r\n    await clearDb(eventB)\r\n    await clearDb(eventC)\r\n\r\n    await populateDb(eventA)\r\n    await populateDb(eventB)\r\n    await populateDb(eventC)\r\n  });\r\n\r\n// run tests\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have added callbacks to my dbHelper functions to try and ensure the functions complete before moving on but this doesn&#39;t seem to be working.\r\n\r\nI have also added the `-i`

In my case, the sizes of the matrices are 12755046 by 46. Simply say, A[46,12755046]*B_i[12755046,46] = C_i[46,46], where i = 1,2,3,....\r\n\r\nThe machine includes 128GB memory and two GTX2080Ti (11GB GPU memory) so my original strategy was to distribute B_i to each GPU. However, I always get INTERNAL ERROR when I execute my code on two GPUs.\r\n\r\nSo I solved this problem by trying three things:\r\n1. use one GPU only. No error.\r\n2. downsize the matrix size but keep using two GPUs. No error.\r\n3. use cublasXt which implicitly uses two GPUs. No error.\r\n\r\nThough it is solved, I am still interested in finding an answer to why my original plan did not work for large dimension matrix? I am guessing this could be due to some internal limitations from cublas or I missed some configurations?\r\n\r\nI attached my simplified code here to illustrate my original plan:\r\n\r\n    double *A, *B[2], *C[2];\r\n    cudaMallocManaged(&amp;A, 46*12755046*sizeof(double));\r\n    cudaMallocManaged(&amp;B[0], 46*12755046*sizeof(double));\r\n    cudaMallocManaged(&amp;B[1], 46*12755046*sizeof(double));\r\n    cudaMallocManaged(&amp;C[0], 46*12755046*sizeof(double));\r\n    cudaMallocManaged(&amp;C[1], 46*12755046*sizeof(double));\r\n    givevalueto(A);\r\n    givevalueto(B[0]);\r\n    givevalueto(B[1]);\r\n    double alpha = 1.0;\r\n    double beta = 0.0;\r\n    cublasHandle_t  handle[nGPUs];\r\n    int iGPU;\r\n    for(iGPU=0;iGPU&lt;nGPUs;iGPU++)\r\n    {\r\n       cublasCreate (&amp; handle[iGPU]);\r\n    }\r\n    for(iGPU=0;iGPU&lt;nGPUs;i++)\r\n    {\r\n       cudaSetDevice(iGPU);\r\n       cublasDgemm(handle[iGPU],CUBLAS_OP_N,CUBLAS_OP_N,46,46,12755046,&amp;alpha,A,46,B[iGPU],12755046,&amp;beta,C[iGPU],46);\r\n    }\r\n    for(iGPU=0;iGPU&lt;nGPUs;i++)\r\n    {\r\n       cudaSetDevice(iGPU);\r\n       cudaDeviceSynchronize();\r\n    }\r\n    for(iGPU=0;iGPU&lt;nGPUs;iGPU++)\r\n    {\r\n       cudaFree(B[iGPU]);\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455094/cublas-matrix-matrix-multiplication-gives-internal-error-when-applying-to-matrix","title":"cublas matrix matrix multiplication gives INTERNAL ERROR when applying to matrix with one very long dimension with multiple GPUs"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":745014,"user_id":157247,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca3e484c121268e4c8302616b2395eb9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"T.J.

whether or not the app is in dark mode programatically at various points in the app (e.g. for image selection):\r\n\r\n    MediaQuery.of(context).platformBrightness == Brightness.dark;\r\n\r\nI could try and update the `MediaQueryData` to override `platformBrightness` as well, but that can only be done inside `MaterialApp`, which seems awkward. \r\n\r\nIs there a better pattern for doing this kind of thing?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455090/flutter-programatically-cause-darktheme-to-be-used","title":"Flutter: programatically cause darkTheme to be

The data type for the variable &quot;Mark&quot; is set as single.\r\n\r\nOne of the nice things about strongly-typed platforms like .Net is most of your validation rules are **already enforced**. You will _not be able to assign a non-number value to `Mark`_, and as a value-type it can&#39;t even be `null` (VB.Net&#39;s `Nothing` will evaluate to `0` for a `Single` type).\r\n\r\nSo what we need to do instead is back up, and find where the data is received from the user, **before** it&#39;s assigned to the `Mark` variable. Somewhere you&#39;ll have code like `Mark(I) = Console.Readline()`, or similar. That&#39;s where your testing needs to be. Check the **string** value received from the user _before_ assigning it to the Single value. And when you come to that point, the best way to accomplish this testing is with the [`Single.TryParse()` function][1]. Then, you can verify the parsed Single value is within the correct range.\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, with more complete code we can start to give you some real improvements. \r\n\r\nOne suggestion is to think in terms of returning a value. It&#39;s better design to let this function return the array, rather than communicating through a global variable. I mention that here because it will also mean changing how you call this function. \r\n\r\nThat out of the way:\r\n\r\n    Function InputMarks() As Single()\r\n         Dim result(3) As Single\r\n\r\n         For I As Integer = 0 To 3\r\n            Dim ErrorMsg As String = &quot;&quot;\r\n            Do \r\n                Console.Write($&quot;{ErrorMsg}Please enter test marks for test {I+1}: &quot;)\r\n                Dim input As String = Console.ReadLine()\r\n                ErrorMsg = $&quot;{vbCrLf}Please enter valid test marks.{vbCrLf}{vbCrLf}&quot;\r\n            While Not Single.TryParse(input, result(I)) OrElse result(I) &lt; 0 OrElse result(I) &gt; 100\r\n         Next\r\n\r\n        Return result\r\n    End Function\r\n\r\nNo `GOTO` required or wanted.\r\n\r\nIf you haven&#39;t seen them yet, the `$&quot;strings&quot;` are using [string interpolation][2] and the [`OrElse` operator][3] instead of `Or` is to get short-circuiting behavior. Modern VB.Net should use `OrElse` and `AndAlso` instead of `Or` and `And` pretty much all the time. \r\n\r\nIn this case, using `OrElse` means we&#39;re sure `Single.TryParse()` completed successfully and we will have a valid number _before_ attempting to verify the range. If the parse operation failed, the range tests won&#39;t even be attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.single.tryparse\r\n  [2]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/programming-guide/language-features/strings/interpolated-strings\r\n  [3]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/language-reference/operators/orelse-operator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455077/visual-basic-validation/58455240#58455240","title":"Visual Basic Validation"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1418,"user_id":1920035,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cRK2R.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1920035/david"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571419407,"creation_date":1571419407,"answer_id":58455553,"question_id":58455077,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455553","body_markdown":"A couple of things:\r\n\r\n1.

is probably accessing the POST data&#39;s values with `request`. The `axios.post` method&#39;s second parameter is the object sent as POST data, so you probably meant to just pass the email and password as top-level keys:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naxios\r\n  .post(\r\n    &quot;http://localhost:8000/api/login&quot;,\r\n    {\r\n      email: &quot;agent@test.com&quot;,\r\n      password: &quot;qwerty!@#$%^&quot;\r\n    },\r\n    { withCredentials: true }\r\n  )\r\n  .then(res =&gt; {\r\n    console.log(res);\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suspect that you may be mixing up authentication in general with [HTTP (&quot;Basic&quot;) Authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication). The `auth` key is part of the `config` object that you can pass as a third parameter to `axios.post`, which would control just that. I do not think this is what you are after, but just adding it here for completeness. Note that basic auth accepts an *username* and a password:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\naxios\r\n  .post(&quot;http://localhost:8000/api/login&quot;, {}, {\r\n      withCredentials: true,\r\n      auth: {\r\n          username: &quot;agent@test.com&quot;,\r\n          password: &quot;qwerty!@#$%^&quot;\r\n      }\r\n  })\r\n  .then(res =&gt;

I believe that, depending on machine load, sometimes the server hasn&#39;t had enough time to start before the test code actually starts executing.\r\n\r\nBasically, what I need is for the `start_server` function to initialise a web application with a websocket endpoint, and not return until the application is prepared to accept websocket connections.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455058/how-do-i-avoid-the-loop-argument","title":"How do I avoid the loop argument"},{"tags":["spring-boot","netflix-eureka"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1583,"user_id":921587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aF3DI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chrips","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/921587/chrips"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1583,"user_id":921587,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aF3DI.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chrips","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/921587/chrips"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571417836,"last_edit_date":1571417836,"creation_date":1571417376,"answer_id":58455111,"question_id":58455055,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58455111","body_markdown":"The defaultZone http://localhost:8010 does not host the dashboard.\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8010 hosts the dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://localhost:8010/eureka\r\nis the URL for Discovery Service Replicas.

And I am happy to answer.\r\n\r\n1. It is YES,  if you are following clean architecture e.g MVVM (Model, View, ViewModel). So, in this architecture, your views are really dummy  and know nothing of where data is coming. Only thing they do is to show data if data comes. View&#39;s only responsibility is to present data, views do not do any business or network logic. On the other hand, ViewModel can be a single source of truth and have one to one relationship with your views (fragment, activity) and ViewModel is lifecycle aware and does handle all the complex and heavy operations. Internally, your view model can have dependency to your repository which has internally dependencies into local data source and remote data source. YES, ViewModel must be single source of truth for your views (activity, fragment) to load data.\r\n\r\n2. As I have written, ViewModel is a single source of truth and it should be the one you can to fetch data from server or local.\r\n\r\n3. It depends on. If it is more UI related job that needs context, you can do it in views. Or if it is heavy computation that needs context such as e.g reading thousands of rows from local database you can do in ViewModel. To get context reference in ViewModel or lower level than it, you can use DI, such as dagger or koin to avoid boilerplate code.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram from Google is one of the famous one to see high level picture of MVVM architecture.[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are so many things to elaborate in this small answer. I think if you check out MVVM architecture you will automatically find all clear answer for your questions and more.\r\n\r\nGoogle hosts a bunch of sample apps for MVVM you may find in the following list.\r\n\r\n[Sample Apps by Google][2] \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/t35v8.png\r\n  [2]: https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/additional-resources","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58455012/is-the-viewmodel-responsible-for-handling-all-the-data-related-operations-of-an/58456445#58456445","title":"Is the ViewModel responsible for handling all the data related operations of an/a Activity/Fragment?"}],"owner":{"reputation":126,"user_id":9117071,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-LClFCmOHhHo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA6g/rW3REpj461c/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rohit Rawat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9117071/rohit-rawat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58456445,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571423633,"creation_date":1571416890,"question_id":58455012,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58455012","body_markdown":"I recently started learning Android Architecture Components (`LiveData`, `ViewModel` and `Navigation`).

apologies if I&#39;ve missed any applicable answers during my search. \r\n\r\nMy asp.net website sends user A an email with a link. Trustwave adds some wrapper information around the link before delivering the email. The user clicks the link, authenticates, and is taken to applicable content. If user A navigates to docs.aspx, selects a PDF, and downloads, PDF is corrupt when user A opens the PDF. The site doesn&#39;t create the PDF, it was uploaded by user B.\r\n\r\n**But**, if user A manually browses to site, authenticates, navigates to docs.aspx, and downloads the PDF, it isn&#39;t corrupt. Both cases use the same authentication, doc.aspx, code-behind, and PDF. \r\n\r\nStepping through the code is difficult because I don&#39;t know how to generate the (Trustwave-protected) email link in my test environment.\r\n\r\nCan you suggest additional ways to troubleshoot this? A PNG file worked in both cases, but I don&#39;t want to limit the file types user B can upload. The PDF file size is 11 KB, and I&#39;m using an up-to-date Chrome web browser.

The following example shows how to use `vscode-textmate` with the official `TypeScript.tmLanguage` but the basics should be applicable to other languages.\r\n\r\n1. First make sure you have Python 2.7 (not 3.X) installed on your machine and on Windows in your PATH variable.\r\n2. Install `vscode-textmate` using npm or yarn which will invoke the required Python interpreter during installation.\r\n3. Grab your XML grammar (usually ending in `.tmLanguage`) and place it in the project root.\r\n4. Use the `vscode-textmate` plugin as follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport * as fs from &quot;fs&quot;;\r\nimport { INITIAL, parseRawGrammar, Registry } from &quot;vscode-textmate&quot;;\r\n\r\nconst registry = new Registry({\r\n    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/require-await\r\n    loadGrammar: async (scopeName) =&gt; {\r\n        if (scopeName === &quot;source.ts&quot;) {\r\n            return new Promise&lt;string&gt;((resolve, reject) =&gt;\r\n                fs.readFile(&quot;./grammars/TypeScript.tmLanguage&quot;, (error, data) =&gt;\r\n                    error !== null ? reject(error) : resolve(data.toString())\r\n                )\r\n            ).then((data) =&gt; parseRawGrammar(data));\r\n        }\r\n        console.info(`Unknown scope: ${scopeName}`);\r\n        return null;\r\n    },\r\n});\r\n\r\nregistry.loadGrammar(&quot;source.ts&quot;).then(\r\n    (grammar) =&gt; {\r\n        fs.readFileSync(&quot;./samples/test.ts&quot;)\r\n            .toString()\r\n            .split(&quot;\\n&quot;)\r\n            .reduce((previousRuleStack, line) =&gt; {\r\n                console.info(`Tokenizing line: ${line}`);\r\n                const { ruleStack, tokens } = grammar.tokenizeLine(line, previousRuleStack);\r\n                tokens.forEach((token) =&gt; {\r\n                    console.info(\r\n                        ` - ${token.startIndex}-${token.endIndex} (${line.substring(\r\n                            token.startIndex,\r\n                            token.endIndex\r\n                        )}) with scopes ${token.scopes.join(&quot;, &quot;)}`\r\n                    );\r\n                });\r\n                return ruleStack;\r\n            }, INITIAL);\r\n    },\r\n    (error) =&gt; {\r\n        console.error(error);\r\n    }\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the `source.ts` string is not referring to a file, it is the scope name from the grammar file. Most likely it&#39;d be `source.ruby` in your case. Furthermore the snippet it not optimized and barely readable, but you should get the gist of how to use the plugin in the first place.\r\n\r\nAfter extracting the tokens you can then map them accordingly based on your requirements.\r\n\r\nThe output in my snippet looks as follows:\r\n\r\n[![Output Sample][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/pfDsL.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454984/how-to-tokenize-a-code-snippet-using-a-textmate-grammar-in-node/58463370#58463370","title":"How to tokenize a code snippet using a Textmate grammar in Node"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":4659,"user_id":796036,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0wtlj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Christian Ivicevic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/796036/christian-ivicevic"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571648430,"post_id":58477894,"comment_id":103297257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454984/how-to-tokenize-a-code-snippet-using-a-textmate-grammar-in-node/58477894#comment103297257_58477894"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4190,"user_id":988414,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/376e4eb9dc6c2e33d1330262edc4f109?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"janko-m","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/988414/janko-m"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571611221,"creation_date":1571611221,"answer_id":58477894,"question_id":58454984,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58477894","body_markdown":"I&#39;ve found the [Highlights](https://github.com/atom/highlights) package under the Atom organization, which uses TextMate grammars and produces tokenized markup.

I&#39;ve tried Highlight.js and Prism, but neither of them tokenize the code correctly (it&#39;s Ruby), so in the end the code is not syntax-highlighted properly. This is because they both implement their own tokenization regexes, which is an approach that&#39;s bound to have flaws.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve then discovered that [GitHub](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/b4a068abf3b9ee66d9413bab5d4dc16ef7c9a71a/vendor/README.md), [Atom](https://github.com/atom/language-ruby/blob/2323b3ebdda18e38510c8ffb8f351b9bf2cc11d9/grammars/ruby.cson) and [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/blob/7460d86cc642e50953ba3471877b5657c24e79da/extensions/ruby/syntaxes/ruby.tmLanguage.json) all use [TextMate grammars](https://github.com/textmate/ruby.tmbundle/blob/089e0ce05032050e9784a30169e5b3e574c3d8f4/Syntaxes/Ruby.plist) for their tokenization. This to me sounds like the right approach, to have language grammars maintained in a single place, so that other tools can then reuse them instead of each defining their own.\r\n\r\nMy question is: **how to tokenize a code string using a TextMate grammar in Node?** My goal is to have something like:\r\n\r\n    const codeSnippet = `\r\n    class Foo\r\n      def bar\r\n        puts &quot;baz&quot;\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n    `\r\n\r\n    const tokenized = tokenizeCode(codeSnippet, &#39;ruby&#39;)\r\n\r\n    tokenized // some kind of array of tokens, e.g:\r\n    // [\r\n    //   [&#39;keyword&#39;, &#39;class&#39;],\r\n    //   [&#39;whitespace&#39;, &#39; &#39;],\r\n    //   [&#39;class&#39;, &#39;Foo&#39;],\r\n    //   ...\r\n    // ]\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried [vscode-textmate](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-textmate), which is what VSCode seems to use for its own syntax highlighting. However, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to use it to achive the functionality above.\r\n\r\nUltimately I want to end up with HTML that I can syntax-highlight:\r\n\r\n    &lt;pre&gt;\r\n      &lt;code&gt;\r\n        &lt;span class=&quot;token kewyord&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token class&quot;&gt;Foo&lt;/span&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- ... --&gt;\r\n      &lt;/code&gt;\r\n    &lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nAgain, I&#39;ve tried highlight.js and Prism, but they both incorrectly tokenize even the simplest Ruby code.\r\n\r\n## Edit\r\n\r\nHere are some examples where Prism and Highlight.js incorrectly tokenize Ruby code:\r\n\r\n* Highlight.js – doesn&#39;t tokenize `Post` as a &quot;constant&quot;\r\n\r\n        const hljs = require(&quot;highlight.js/lib/highlight.js&quot;);\r\n        hljs.registerLanguage(&#39;ruby&#39;, require(&#39;highlight.js/lib/languages/ruby&#39;));\r\n\r\n        const rubyCode = `Post.create(params[:post])`\r\n        const html = hljs.highlight(&#39;ruby&#39;, rubyCode).value\r\n\r\n        console.log(html)\r\n        // Post.create(params[&lt;span class=&quot;hljs-symbol&quot;&gt;:post&lt;/span&gt;])\r\n\r\n* Prism – doesn&#39;t tokenize `foo:` as a &quot;symbol&quot;\r\n\r\n        const Prism = require(&#39;prismjs&#39;);\r\n        const loadLanguages = require(&#39;prismjs/components/&#39;);\r\n        loadLanguages([&#39;ruby&#39;]);\r\n\r\n        const rubyCode = `{ foo: &quot;bar&quot; }`\r\n        const html = Prism.highlight(rubyCode, Prism.languages.ruby, &#39;ruby&#39;)\r\n\r\n        console.log(html)\r\n        // &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; foo&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;bar&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454984/how-to-tokenize-a-code-snippet-using-a-textmate-grammar-in-node","title":"How to tokenize a code snippet using a Textmate grammar in Node"},{"tags":["sql","oracle","pyspark","pyspark-sql","pyspark-dataframes"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6149226,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ee1505cd5588f18151deb4c8657c193?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jon Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6149226/jon-snow"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571650964,"creation_date":1571650964,"answer_id":58483652,"question_id":58454982,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58483652","body_markdown":"sqlContext.sql(&quot;query&quot;) will NOT support everything used in ORACLE sql.

suppose the problem is that the `MockAuthService` &amp; `MockAlertService` don&#39;t not completely implement the classes they mock. For example `MockAuthService.clearUserData()` is missing in the mock implementation. Because of this, there should be a runtime error in the browser console, and you get the test failed. I&#39;ve reproduced the problem with the same errors that you have.\r\n\r\nProbably it&#39;s better to implement the mocks from the original classes to get compile errors, if some functionality is missing, like: \r\n```kotlin\r\nclass MockAuthService implements AuthService { ... }\r\n```\r\nAnother approach is to use jasmine mocks. In this case the compiler won&#39;t warn you if some method is missing, but the mocking becomes easier, like:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst authServiceMock = jasmine.createSpyObj&lt;AuthService&gt;(AuthService.name, [\r\n    &#39;gotoLoginPage&#39;,\r\n    &#39;clearUserData&#39;\r\n]);\r\n```\r\nYou can provide it like:\r\n```typescript\r\n{ provide: AuthService, useValue: authServiceMock }\r\n```\r\nEvery method in the mock is a spy now, so you can check it like other spies, like:\r\n```typescript\r\nexpect(authServiceMock.gotoLoginPage).toHaveBeenCalled();\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454978/jasmine-test-fails-expected-undefined-to-equal/58484105#58484105","title":"Jasmine test fails Expected undefined to equal"}],"owner":{"reputation":590,"user_id":4607841,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71cd701f6826481858ee299f68f3205a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4607841/tom"},"last_editor":{"reputation":590,"user_id":4607841,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71cd701f6826481858ee299f68f3205a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Tom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4607841/tom"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":73,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"bounty_amount":50,"bounty_closes_date":1572195659,"accepted_answer_id":58484105,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571654749,"creation_date":1571416744,"last_edit_date":1571653580,"question_id":58454978,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454978","body_markdown":"I have written an angular test to test httpstatus 0 code returned when the service is not available.\r\nWhile running the test I am getting the following error.

Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\n```\r\n#Sample Input\r\nlibrary(tibble)\r\njar.beta &lt;- tribble(\r\n  ~date, ~variant, ~appearance, ~crunch, ~spring, ~density, ~season, ~salt, ~overall,\r\n  1-1-19, 11, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5,\r\n  1-1-19, 11, 4, 5, 1, 1, 3, 7, 8,\r\n  1-1-19, 1.4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 2, 2, 2.5,\r\n  1-1-19, 1.4, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5,\r\n  1-1-19, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5,\r\n  1-1-19, 1.3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 4, 2, 5\r\n)  \r\n\r\njar.beta$variant &lt;- as.factor(jar.beta$variant)\r\njar.beta$date &lt;-as.factor(jar.beta$date)  \r\n\r\n#Code in Question \r\npercentage &lt;- vector(&quot;list&quot;, 7)                     \r\nnames(percentage) &lt;- colnames(jar.beta[3:9])\r\nfor (i in 1:9){\r\n    attribute.freq  &lt;- table(jar.beta$variant,jar.beta[,i+2])\r\n    percentage[[i]] &lt;- as.matrix(100*prop.table(attribute.freq,margin=1),2)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n#Desired Output as a Percent Frequency Table\r\n                 2   2.5     3   3.5     4   4.5     5   5.5     6   6.5     7     8   8.5\r\n  11         16.67 33.33 16.67  0.00  0.00  0.00 16.67  0.00  0.00  0.00 16.67  0.00  0.00\r\n  1.4        0.00  0.00 16.67  0.00 16.67 16.67 50.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00\r\n  1.3        0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00 66.67 16.67  0.00  0.00  0.00  0.00 16.67\r\n  \r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454970/why-is-the-table-function-having-length-argument-error-with-no-nas","title":"Why is the table() function having length argument error with no NA&#39;s?"},{"tags":["javascript","node.js"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":189796,"user_id":229044,"user_type":"moderator","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WJCS6.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"meagar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/229044/meagar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571416923,"post_id":58454969,"comment_id":103247299,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454969/is-it-possible-to-safely-allow-users-to-run-their-scripts-on-node-js-server#comment103247299_58454969"},{"owner":{"reputation":12889,"user_id":2317490,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ypoen.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"dandavis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2317490/dandavis"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571417368,"post_id":58454969,"comment_id":103247486,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454969/is-it-possible-to-safely-allow-users-to-run-their-scripts-on-node-js-server#comment103247486_58454969"}],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":11130969,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fuVGaW3GbRI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reb6_8zWa_wj6_e1T4IfadBPIqe3w/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tuf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11130969/tuf"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571416858,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571416676,"creation_date":1571416676,"question_id":58454969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454969","body_markdown":"Is it possible to run scripts from untrusted sources safely in Node.js?\r\n\r\nScripts doesn&#39;t have to be JavaScript or a complete scripting language, I just need to let users create simple commands that react to events, commands like those:\r\n\r\n    var cow = api.get_cow()\r\n    var cat = api.get_cat()\r\n    cat.on(&#39;collision&#39;, (e) =&gt;

have a simple database project. I have a file that lists some classes (which are defined by struct class_t which holds 3 char arrays) and then I have an array of pointers `class_t *classes[MAX_CLASSES]` the prog is supposed to do 4 things. The user can:\r\n\r\n1. list classes\r\n\r\n2. add a class\r\n\r\n3. delete a class\r\n\r\n4. exit and save the changes back to the file.\r\n\r\nSo, for the sake of an explanation, let&#39;s give an example file:\r\n```\r\n5 \\\\used to state how many classes there are. this is my &quot;class_count&quot; variable\r\nCS:250:VH1224\r\nBIO:107:MG1110\r\nPHRE:110:BH210\r\nFREN:110:BH312\r\nCS:260:VH1225\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I enter the delete function, it asks which class (based on it&#39;s class number which can be seen in list) to delete. Let&#39;s assume I delete class 1 (based on the file it would be CS 25 VH1224), I have some code that looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nint classnum = 0\r\nif(answer == 1 &amp;&amp; classes[(answer - 1)] != NULL)\r\n    {\r\n      classnum = answer - 1;\r\n      free(classes[classnum]);\r\n      classes[classnum] = (class_t*) malloc(sizeof(class_t));\r\n      while(classnum &lt;= MAX_CLASSES &amp;&amp; classes[classnum] != NULL &amp;&amp; classnum &lt; class_count)\r\n\t  {\r\n\t    classes[classnum] = classes[(classnum + 1)];\r\n\t    classnum++;\r\n\t  }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nevery other part of it works other than the copying.

I have a .dll with a bunch of function statements that are utilized in R. Therefore, whenever R uses one of these C functions, I would like the console to appear. After doing some googling, I found the following code:\r\n```\r\nvoid displayToConsole(const char *string)\r\n{\r\n\tAllocConsole();\r\n\tHANDLE h = GetStdHandle(STD_OUTPUT_HANDLE);\r\n\r\n\tif (h == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tMessageBox(NULL, &quot;stdoutnot available&quot;, &quot;Error&quot;, MB_OK);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif (WriteConsole(h, string, strlen(string), NULL, NULL) == FALSE)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tif (AllocConsole() == TRUE)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tWriteConsole(h, string, strlen(string), NULL, NULL);\r\n\t\t\tgetch();\r\n\t\t\tFreeConsole();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\telse\r\n\t\tgetch();\r\n\r\nint WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpszCmdline, int nCmdShow)\r\n{\r\n\tdisplayToConsole(&quot;Test&quot;);\r\n\r\n\treturn 0;\r\n}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I threw the `displayToConsole()` function in one of the C functions utilized by R, but I do not see any contents printed to the console. An example of this would be an R function that creates a GUI. Upon initialization of the GUI, I would like to have the console appear and print out information.

Is this even possible to do with variables, am I just missing something simple?\r\n\r\nHere is my problematic example code:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;int size&gt;\r\nclass Test\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n\tconstexpr static bool ENABLE = (size &lt; 10);\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n\ttemplate &lt;bool E = ENABLE, typename std::enable_if&lt;E, int&gt;::type = 0&gt;\r\n\tstatic int foo;\r\n\r\n\ttemplate &lt;bool E = ENABLE, typename std::enable_if&lt;!E, int&gt;::type = 0&gt;\r\n\tconstexpr static int foo = 12;\r\n};\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;int size&gt;\r\ntemplate &lt;bool E, typename std::enable_if&lt;E, int&gt;::type&gt;\r\nint Test&lt;size&gt;::foo = 7;\r\n\r\ntemplate &lt;int size&gt;\r\ntemplate &lt;bool E, typename

&lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n\tstd::cout &lt;&lt; v2.foo&lt;&gt; &lt;&lt; &quot;\\n&quot;;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, any help/guidance is

to move everything related to the counter into your counter component \r\n\r\nIf you need access to this.state.time elsewhere in your App consider useContext or Redux (according to React team for App level management of state that changes frequently try to use Redux over useContext which is the case here). \r\n\r\nsetState() at the App component level will likely re-render everything in your app every time its updated (in this case approximately every 1000ms)\r\n\r\n\r\nBetter Example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: true --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language:

trying to get my Hands dirty building a Pomodoro Clock.

But how to pause this counter at any time? I have another button with the pause function, and i&#39;ve tried to write a function with clearInterval but it doesn&#39;t work. Shall i use a boolean logic to start/stop, or maybe handle the clearInterval inside the Main App component? I&#39;m totally lost.

The way to deal with this is generally to modify your types so that they differ structurally as well as nominally, as mentioned in the TypeScript FAQ entry: [&quot;How do I prevent two types from being structurally compatible?&quot;](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-prevent-two-types-from-being-structurally-compatible)\r\n\r\nNow in this case the offending interfaces are apparently in a library that you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to touch.  Luckily, you can use [declaration merging](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html) to re-open interface definitions and add new properties to them.  Probably you want to add something optional so that it&#39;s okay that no actual such properties exist at runtime.  For example:\r\n\r\n    ///// DECLARATION MERGING //////\r\n    interface DataTypeBoolean {\r\n        __type?: &quot;boolean&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    interface DataTypeJSON {\r\n        __type?: &quot;JSON&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    ///////////////////////////////\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that if you are importing your interfaces from a module, you might need to use `declare module` around your merged definitions, [as shown in the Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html#module-augmentation) like\r\n\r\n    declare module &quot;./myLib&quot; {\r\n      interface DataTypeBoolean {\r\n          __type?: &quot;boolean&quot;\r\n      }\r\n      interface DataTypeJSON {\r\n          __type?: &quot;JSON&quot;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nAnyway, once we do that, things should start to work for you, as the compiler can see that those types are different:\r\n\r\n    type Hmm = Types&lt;Def&gt;;\r\n    /* type Hmm = {\r\n        flag: boolean;\r\n        data: object;\r\n    } */\r\n\r\nOkay, hope that helps.

The basic answer is that when the `A` object&#39;s destructor starts, the lifetime of the object ends, but it is still legal to access the `A` object&#39;s members (with some restrictions) until the destructor of `A` completes. The standard references are:\r\n\r\n[basic.life]/1:\r\n\r\n&gt; ... The lifetime of an object `o` of type `T` ends when: if `T` is a class type with a non-trivial destructor (15.4), the destructor call starts, ...\r\n\r\n[basic.life]/6:\r\n\r\n&gt; Before the lifetime of an object has started but after the storage which the object will occupy has been\r\nallocated41 or, after the lifetime of an object has ended and before the storage which the object occupied is\r\nreused or released, any pointer that represents the address of the storage location where the object will be or\r\nwas located may be used but only in limited ways. For an object under construction or destruction, see 15.7. ...\r\n\r\n[class.cdtor]/2 (*i.e.*, 15.7/2):\r\n\r\n&gt; ... To form a pointer to (or access the value of) a direct non-static member of an object `obj`, the construction of `obj` shall have started and its destruction shall not have completed, otherwise the computation of the pointer value (or accessing\r\nthe member value) results in undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nThus, as the access to `a2-&gt;m_i` occurs while the object `*a2`&#39;s destructor is being executed, it is allowed. (*Note:* `A::m_i` is a direct member of `A`, since `A` has no base classes.)\r\n\r\nNote that (as some others have pointed out already), the memory in which the `A` object is stored will not be deallocated until after the destructor completes. That is how `delete` expressions work.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58454920/can-i-use-a-pointer-to-a-destructed-object-inside-its-destructor/58455268#58455268","title":"Can I use a pointer to a destructed object inside its destructor?"}],"owner":{"reputation":103,"user_id":4051145,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/99472d8e25426f77f5389c3cfcc829cc?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"James","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4051145/james"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58454999,"answer_count":4,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571420566,"creation_date":1571416459,"question_id":58454920,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58454920","body_markdown":"Is it defined behavior that I can access a destroyed object from a pointer inside its destructor?
