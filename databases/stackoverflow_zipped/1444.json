All stackoverflow answers did not work fo me (most are for older version of the components involved), the same goes for the keycloak documentation.  \r\n\r\nRecently we have implemented keycloak-based athentication for our Django-based website. Works fine for auth.\r\nThe app is build by docker, three containers: the website on port 8000, keycloak db (postgres image), keycloak (jboss/keycloak image) on port 8080.\r\n\r\nNow I have to add &quot;Logout&quot; functionality to it, meaning singing out of keycloak from my Django code, and redirect the user back to the keycloak login screen. \r\n\r\nMy setup:\r\n\r\n    Django 2.2\r\n    Python 3.5\r\n    keycloak 7\r\n    social-auth-app-django         3.1.0\r\n    social-auth-core               3.2.0\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[The keycloak documentation][1] suggests this:\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.keycloak.org/docs-api/7.0/rest-api/index.html\r\n\r\n    POST /{realm}/users/{id}/logout\r\nwith user id and realm name. \r\n\r\nThis returns 403 and the error :\r\n&quot;Forbidden (CSRF cookie not set.): /{realm name}/users/{user id}/logout/&quot;\r\n\r\n**urls.py**\r\n\r\n    urlpaterns = [\r\n    ....\r\n        url(r&#39;logout/$&#39;, logout_view, name=&#39;logout&#39;),\r\n    ...\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n**views.py**\r\n\r\n    from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect\r\n    import requests\r\n    def logout_view(request):\r\n        url = &#39;%s&lt;realm name&gt;/users/&lt;user id&gt;/logout/&#39; % settings.LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL\r\n    \r\n        r = requests.post(url, data = {})\r\n        #r.status_code at this point is 403\r\n\r\n        #also tried another sugestion: \r\n        url = &#39;%sauth/realms/%s/protocol/openid-connect/logout/&#39; % (settings.LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL, &#39;&lt;some realm name&gt;&#39;)\r\n    \r\n        r = requests.post(url, data = {})\r\n        #r.status_code at this point is 403\r\n    \r\n        #also tried with refresh_token and client_id:\r\n        url = &quot;http://&lt;website ip&gt;:8000/&lt;realm name&gt;/users/&lt;user id&gt;/logout/&quot;\r\n        refresh_token = &#39;&lt;some refresh token pulled out from stout&gt;&#39;\r\n        r = requests.post(url, data = {&#39;refresh_token&#39;: refresh_token, &#39;client_id&#39;: &#39;&lt;user id&gt;&#39;})\r\n        #for &#39;client_id&#39; above tried both user id and user name\r\n        #r.status_code at this point is also 403\r\n    \r\n        return HttpResponseRedirect(&quot;http://&lt;website ip&gt;:8000&quot;)\r\n\r\nThat sends me back to the frontpage of my website, I am still logged in and can browse the site normally. Hitting keycloak login screen at this point sends me back to my website front page already logged in, so I am still authenticated. Killing session before the POST in Django code does not change anything.  Basically, there&#39;s no logout from either websste or keycloak when I am authenticated with keycloak. Keycloak expiration with time does happen, so realm.json settings work. \r\n\r\nI did try to set this in my settings.py:\r\n\r\n    CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = False\r\n    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False\r\n\r\n..but no effect. \r\n\r\n**So, where can I find an example of working Django code that logs out a user from Keycloak?

You could specify all numbers you want to allow (from 20 to 10) like this `(20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30|31|01|1|02|2|03|3|04|4|05|5|06|6|07|7|08|8|09|9|10)`.\r\n\r\n`(2019|2020)\\-(12|01)\\-(20|21|22|23|24|25|26|27|28|29|30|31|01|1|02|2|03|3|04|4|05|5|06|6|07|7|08|8|09|9|10)`\r\n\r\n*But honestly... Regular-Expressions are not the right tool for this. RegExp gives a mask to something, not a logical context. Use regex to extract the data/value from a string and validate those values using another language.*\r\n\r\nThe above 2nd Regex will, f.e. match your dates, but also values outside of this range since there is no context between `2019|2020` and the second group `12|01` so they match values like `2019-12-11` but also `2020-12-11`.\r\n\r\nTo only match the values you want this will be a really large regex like this (inner brackets only if you need them) `((2019)-(12)-(20)|(2019)-(12)-(21)|(2019)-(12)-(22)|...)` and continue with all possible dates - and ask yourself: what would you do if you find such a regex in a project you have to work with ;)\r\n\r\nBetter solution (quick and dirty, there might be better solutions):  \r\n`(?&lt;yyyy&gt;20[0-9]{2})\\-(?&lt;mm&gt;[01][0-9]|[0-9])\\-(?&lt;dd&gt;[0-3][0-9]|[0-9])`\r\n\r\nThis way you have three named groups (yyyy, mm, dd) you can access and validate the matched values... The regex is smaller, you have a better association between code and regex and both are easier to maintain.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198703/regex-expression-for-date-within-dates-range/58199629#58199629","title":"Regex expression for date within dates range"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12148905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb8a65cc2abd062570fb8bfa532d1e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"octav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12148905/octav"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570014566,"post_id":58199653,"comment_id":102778467,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198703/regex-expression-for-date-within-dates-range/58199653#comment102778467_58199653"},{"owner":{"reputation":45287,"user_id":1331451,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4ZPmj.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"simbabque","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1331451/simbabque"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571148195,"post_id":58199653,"comment_id":103138586,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198703/regex-expression-for-date-within-dates-range/58199653#comment103138586_58199653"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3229,"user_id":4243840,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aaeabd769bae1bf82fd4b8882fed6653?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"JGNI","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4243840/jgni"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570011786,"creation_date":1570011786,"answer_id":58199653,"question_id":58198703,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58199653","body_markdown":"Regex only deal with characters. so we have to work out at each position in the date what are the valid characters.\r\n\r\nThe first part is easy. The first two characters have to be `20`\r\nNow it gets complicated the next character can be a `1` or a `2` but what follows depends on the value of that character so we split the rest of the regex into two sections the first if the third character matches `1` and the second if it matches `2`\r\n\r\nWe know that if the third character is a `1` then what must follow is the characters `9-12-` as the range starts at 2019-12-20  now for the day part. The 9th character is the tens for the day this can only be `2` or `3` as we are already in the last month and the minimum date is 20. The last character can be any digit 0-9. This gives us a day match of [23][0-9]. Putting this together we now have a pattern for years starting 2019 as `19-12-[23][0-9]`\r\n\r\nIt the third character is a `2` then we can match up to the day part of the date a gain as the range ends in January. This gives us a partial match of `20-01-` leaving us to work on the day part. Hear we know that the first character of the day can either be a `1` or `0` however if it&#39;s a `1` then the last character must be a `0` and if it&#39;s a `0` then the last character can only be in the range `1` to `9`. This give us another alteration `(?:0[1-9]|10)` Putting the second part together we get `20-01-(?:0[1-9]|10)`.\r\n\r\nCombining these together gives the final regex `20(?:19-12-[23][0-9]|20-01-(?:0[1-9]|10))`\r\n\r\nNote that I&#39;m assuming that the date you are testing against is a validly formatted date.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198703/regex-expression-for-date-within-dates-range/58199653#58199653","title":"Regex expression for date within dates range"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12148905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb8a65cc2abd062570fb8bfa532d1e8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"octav","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12148905/octav"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58199653,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1570011786,"creation_date":1570008202,"question_id":58198703,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58198703","body_markdown":"I need to validate with regex a date in format yyyy-mm-dd (2019-12-31) that should be within the range 2019-12-20 - 2020-01-10.\r\nWhat would be the regex for this?\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198703/regex-expression-for-date-within-dates-range","title":"Regex expression for date within dates range"},{"tags":["android","android-statusbar","material-components-android"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33152,"user_id":1843331,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77726658fa83c059e6e95ba36cbcc981?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tim Castelijns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1843331/tim-castelijns"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570009289,"post_id":58198951,"comment_id":102776053,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198699/how-to-hide-status-bar-and-navigation-bar-using-theme-materialcomponents/58198951#comment102776053_58198951"},{"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":8835675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAQ9X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Webfreak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8835675/webfreak"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":33152,"user_id":1843331,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/77726658fa83c059e6e95ba36cbcc981?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tim Castelijns","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1843331/tim-castelijns"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570009902,"post_id":58198951,"comment_id":102776373,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198699/how-to-hide-status-bar-and-navigation-bar-using-theme-materialcomponents/58198951#comment102776373_58198951"},{"owner":{"reputation":41,"user_id":3526377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cf5aeba8709cd5dc0a9f1999da8a37a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Skalaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3526377/skalaw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019925,"post_id":58198951,"comment_id":102781248,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198699/how-to-hide-status-bar-and-navigation-bar-using-theme-materialcomponents/58198951#comment102781248_58198951"},{"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":8835675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAQ9X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Webfreak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8835675/webfreak"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":41,"user_id":3526377,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cf5aeba8709cd5dc0a9f1999da8a37a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Skalaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3526377/skalaw"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570020242,"post_id":58198951,"comment_id":102781442,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198699/how-to-hide-status-bar-and-navigation-bar-using-theme-materialcomponents/58198951#comment102781442_58198951"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":307,"user_id":8835675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAQ9X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Webfreak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8835675/webfreak"},"last_editor":{"reputation":307,"user_id":8835675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BAQ9X.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Webfreak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8835675/webfreak"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570020219,"last_edit_date":1570020219,"creation_date":1570009036,"answer_id":58198951,"question_id":58198699,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58198951","body_markdown":"1.

(Well, unless you `return` or `throw` from the `case`.) But keep reading...\r\n\r\nIf you want to avoid writing the `break`s, you can use an `if`/`else if`/`else` structure instead:\r\n\r\n    if (w == 1) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n    } else if (w == 2) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;2&quot;);\r\n    } else if (w == 3) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;3p&quot;);\r\n    } else if (w == 4) {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;4&quot;);\r\n    } else {\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;csd&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**But**: Once &lt;s&gt;[JEP 325][1]&lt;/s&gt; [JEP 354][2] is supported, you&#39;ll be able to use a `switch` *expression* instead:\r\n\r\n    switch (w) {\r\n        case 1 -&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n        case 2 -&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;2&quot;);\r\n        case 3 -&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;3p&quot;);\r\n        case 4 -&gt;  System.out.println(&quot;4&quot;);\r\n        default -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;csd&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nJEP 325 is a [preview feature][3] in JDK 12.0.2 and JEP 354 (a slight update to it) is a preview feature in JDK 13. You can compile code using it like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\njavac --enable-preview --release 13 Example.java\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nand run it like this:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\njava --enable-preview --release 13 Example\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nUse release 13 for JEP 325 and 14 for JEP 354.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usage above, the interesting thing about `switch` expressions is that they&#39;re *expressions* resulting in a value.

problem translates to finding the shortest path in a graph where your numbers are the nodes and weighted, bidirectional edges connect neighbours horizontally and vertically. The weight or distance for each edge is the ascent or descent (as @jhamon said). So your graph becomes:\r\n\r\n    1 -1- 2 -1- 3\r\n    |     |     |\r\n    0     0     3\r\n    |     |     |\r\n    1 -1- 2 -2- 0\r\n    |     |     |\r\n    5     1     2\r\n    |     |     |\r\n    6 -3- 3 -1- 2\r\n\r\nNote that some edges have weight 0, that is, are traveled for free.\r\n\r\nSo look up an algorithm for finding the shortest path in a graph. Dijkstra’s algorithm is the obvious choice.\r\n\r\nOr to spell it out just a little bit more: Your program will perform two steps after each other:\r\n\r\n 1. Convert your matrix to a graph where the distances between nodes are the ascents/descents. From your sample 3 by 3 array you will get a graph with 9 nodes and 12 edges.\r\n 2. Run Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest distance from the starting node (the node generated from index [0, 0]) to every other node of the graph. This will also make sure that the distance to the end is calculated. This distance is the minimum amount of ascent or descent.\r\n\r\n**Link:** [Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm | Greedy

When a user clicks a list entry from the master component, this should be shown in the URL like `https://localhost:44344/masterdetail/2` and than load the employee readonly detail view into the detail area\r\n\r\n2. When a user clicks the edit button located on the employee readonly detail view, the master detail page should switch to the employee edit view inside the detail area and show this in the URL like `https://localhost:44344/masterdetail/2/edit`\r\n\r\n3. When a user clicks the save button located on the employee edit view, the master detail page should switch to the employee readonly detail view inside the detail area and show this in the URL like `https://localhost:44344/masterdetail/2`\r\n\r\nThe problems that I have faced:\r\nWhen the user is in the readonly view and than clicks the edit button, my code is calling `NavigationManager.NavigateTo($&quot;/masterdetail/{Id}/edit&quot;);` which switches the URL in the address bar of the browser but does not invoke the `OnParametersSet()` lifecycle method of the master detail page.\r\n**Blazor seems to reuse the instance if the [Parameter] Id has not changed it&#39;s value.**\r\n\r\nThe same happens when the user is on /masterdetail/{Id}/edit route (entered via browser address bar) and than clicks the save button.\r\n\r\nWhat I learned while researching the problem:\r\n\r\n - I know that I could use the forceLoad parameter of the\r\n   `NavigationManager.NavigateTo($&quot;/masterdetail/{Id}/edit&quot;, true);`\r\n   call like this, **but this would lead to a complete page refresh**\r\n   and I&#39;m not sure if this is necessary.\r\n - I know that I could use `EventCallback&lt;T&gt;` in my child components and\r\n   react on these events in the parent master detail page but this seems\r\n   like a workaround.\r\n - I looked for a way to &quot;**route inside a blazor page**&quot; and stumbled\r\n   across topics like &quot;**Areas**&quot; and &quot;**Partial Views**&quot; but it looks\r\n   like these are MVC concepts.\r\n - I also found something called the &quot;**RouteView**&quot;\r\n   (https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore/blob/2e4274cb67c049055e321c18cc9e64562da52dcf/src/Components/Components/src/RouteView.cs)\r\n   which is a Blazor component but I had no luck using it for my\r\n   purposes.\r\n\r\nHere is a simplified sample that shows the problem:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new &quot;Blazor App&quot; project in Visual Studio\r\n2. Choose &quot;Blazor Server App&quot;\r\n3. Add a new .razor file and paste the code snippet in\r\n4. Have a look at the comments and the code\r\n5. Navigate to `https://localhost:44344/masterdetail/` and try it yourself\r\n\r\n \r\n```\r\n@*Default route for this page when no entry is selected in the master list*@\r\n@page &quot;/masterdetail&quot;\r\n@*Route for this page when an entry is selected in the master list.

If you inspect the finished postgres container (`docker inspect &lt;container-id&gt;`) the entrypoint and command look like this:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Cmd&quot;: [\r\n    \t&quot;pg_restore -U postgres -d postgres /var/lib/postgresql/ph.backup&quot;\r\n    ],\r\n    \r\n    &quot;Entrypoint&quot;: [\r\n    \t&quot;docker-entrypoint.sh&quot;\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThat practically means that the default entrypoint script [docker-entrypoint](https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh) \r\nis executed with one argument which is the `pg_restore` command. At line 176 the script execs the passed in arguments (`exec &quot;$@&quot;`). \r\nThe exec command needs a command and a list of arguments \r\n\r\n    exec [command [arguments]]\r\n\r\nbut in this case the command is the full string formed by `pg_restore` and its arguments.

That prevents caching issues while trying things out...\r\n\r\nIn case you receive an internal server error (http status 500) using the rule above then chances are that you operate a very old version of the apache http server. You will see a definite hint to an unsupported `[END]` flag in your http servers error log file in that case. You can either try to upgrade or use the older `[L]` flag, it probably will work the same in this situation, though that depends a bit on your setup. \r\n\r\nThis implementation will work likewise in the http servers host configuration or inside a dynamic configuration file (&quot;.htaccess&quot; file). Obviously the rewriting module needs to be loaded inside the http server and enabled in the http host. In case you use a dynamic configuration file you need to take care that it&#39;s interpretation is enabled at all in the host configuration and that it is located in the host&#39;s `DOCUMENT_ROOT` folder. \r\n\r\nAnd a general remark: you should always prefer to place such rules in the http servers host configuration instead of using dynamic configuration files (&quot;.htaccess&quot;). Those dynamic configuration files add complexity, are often a cause of unexpected behavior, hard to debug and they really slow down the http server. They are only provided as a last option for situations where you do not have access to the real http servers host configuration (read: really cheap service providers) or for applications insisting on writing their own rules (which is an obvious security nightmare). \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198609/remove-directory-name-from-url-by-htaccess-from-sub-directory/58206017#58206017","title":"remove directory name from URL by htaccess from sub directory"}],"owner":{"reputation":4029,"user_id":1256909,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":46,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/QGGko.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rejoanul Alam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1256909/rejoanul-alam"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58206017,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570117744,"creation_date":1570007814,"question_id":58198609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58198609","body_markdown":"I have a root directory where 2 (user &amp; admin) project exist.

Answer**\r\n\r\nSo, essentially, you don&#39;t have a Numpy array, but you have a list of lists wherein each element is a **single** 24-bit number that represents an RGB triplet RGB888.\r\n\r\nSo, I can make a representation of your list like this:\r\n\r\n    f=[ \r\n    [0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF],\r\n    [0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF],\r\n    [0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF],\r\n    [0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF],\r\n    [0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0x000000,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF,0xFFFFFF]\r\n    ] \r\n\r\nSo, I can make that into a Numpy array of uint32 elements like this:\r\n\r\n    na = np.array(f).astype(np.uint32) \r\n\r\nAnd then make an RGB array that PIL will like using:\r\n\r\n    h,w = 5,10\r\n    RGB=np.zeros((h,w,3),dtype=np.uint8)\r\n\r\nThen I just have to shift and copy the triplets into the right places:\r\n\r\n    RGB[:,:,0] = na&gt;&gt;16            # Take red from top\r\n    RGB[:,:,1] = (na&gt;&gt;8) &amp; 0xff    # Take green from middle\r\n    RGB[:,:,2] = na &amp; 0xff         # Take blue from bottom\r\n\r\nNow I can make a PIL image from that RGB array and save it to disk:\r\n\r\n    pIm = Image.fromarray(RGB).save(&#39;result.png&#39;)\r\n    \r\n\r\n**Original Answer**\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s create a file of test data with **ImageMagick**. First as a PNG, just so you can see it:\r\n\r\n    magick -size 640x480 gradient:magenta-yellow image.png\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnd now the same thing again, but this time as RGB888 to match your file:\r\n\r\n    magick -size 640x480 gradient:magenta-yellow -depth 8 rgb:image.bin\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow:\r\n\r\n    from PIL import Image\r\n\r\n    # Open the file and read contents into &quot;data&quot;\r\n    with open(&#39;image.bin&#39;,&#39;rb&#39;) as f: \r\n        data = f.read() \r\n \r\n    # Convert that into PIL Image\r\n    im = Image.frombuffer(&#39;RGB&#39;, (640, 480), data, &#39;raw&#39;, &#39;RGB&#39;, 0, 1)\r\n\r\n    # Save\r\n    im.save(&#39;result.png&#39;)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nYou could equally let Numpy read the file and then convert the result to a PIL Image:\r\n\r\n    import numpy as np\r\n\r\n    im = Image.fromarray(np.fromfile(&#39;image.bin&#39;,dtype=np.uint8).reshape(480,640,3))\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to check your binary file actually contains what you think it contains, you can also convert it to a PNG with **ImageMagick** to test it. Say you think the file is 640 pixels wide by 480 pixels tall and RGB888, you can ask **ImageMagick** to make it into a PNG with:\r\n\r\n    magick -depth 8 -size 640x480 RGB:&lt;YOURFILENAME&gt; image.png\r\n\r\nOr, if you think it is a single 16-bit, single channel greyscale image with a 128 byte header that you want to ignore:\r\n\r\n    magick -depth 16 -size 640x480+128 GRAY:&lt;YOURFILENAME&gt; image.png\r\n\r\n\r\n**Keywords**: Raw, raw image, binary file, image, image processing, Python, ImageMagick, convert.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/raWTB.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198583/conversion-2-dimensional-rgb-matrix-to-png-image-with-python-3-6/58200811#58200811","title":"Conversion 2-dimensional rgb matrix to PNG Image with Python 3.6"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":2021948,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTiLj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Uwe_98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2021948/uwe-98"},"last_editor":{"reputation":27,"user_id":2021948,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/qTiLj.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Uwe_98","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2021948/uwe-98"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":64,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58200811,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570616124,"creation_date":1570007730,"last_edit_date":1570089535,"question_id":58198583,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58198583","body_markdown":"I need to convert a 2-dimensional 24bit rgb- matrix with Python 3.6\r\n\r\n    [[rr11gg11bb11, rr12gg12bb12,..  ..,rr1mgg1mbb1m],\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n     [rri1gg11bb11, rr12ggi2bb12,..  ..,rr1mgg1mbb1m]\r\n    .\r\n    .\r\n     [rrn1ggn1bbn1, rrn2ggn2bbn2,.. ..,rrmnggmnbbmn]]\r\n\r\ninto an image of the format tif, png and jpg.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve also got the matrix in form of a file\r\n \r\n    image.bin.\r\n\r\nFrom this binary file I can whatch the image with the help of a RAW Pixel Viewer: \r\n\r\n    http://rawpixels.net/ \r\n\r\nI have found the PIL library, but I didn&#39;t find any method to build an image object out of these data.

the following query `select sum(Team1) from T_Score;` and instead of `cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();` use `cmd.ExecuteScalar();` and use the return value of the method `ExecuteScalar`\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand.executescalar\r\n\r\nLike this:\r\n\r\n    private void WriteToLabel()\r\n    {    \r\n        using (SqlConnection conne = new SqlConnection(@&quot;Data Source=LAPTOP-S2J1U9SJ\\SQLEXPRESS;Initial Catalog=Unit4_IT;Integrated Security=True&quot;))\r\n        {\r\n            conne.Open();\r\n            string selectQuery = &quot;select sum(Team1) from T_Score;&quot;;\r\n            using (SqlCommand com = new SqlCommand(selectQuery, conne))\r\n                label1.Content = Convert.ToString(com.ExecuteScalar());\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe line \r\n\r\n    label1.Content = Convert.ToString(com.ExecuteScalar());\r\n\r\nWill require a `Label` called `label1` for it to work.\r\nIt tries to write the result of `Convert.ToString(com.ExecuteScalar())` into the `Content` property of said `Label`.\r\n\r\nYou can also use a `TextBlock` and than use the `Text` Property, so this line:\r\n\r\n    textBlock1.Text = Convert.ToString(com.ExecuteScalar());\r\n\r\nNotice instead of calling `conne.Close();` manually, I wrapped the `SqlConnection conne` into a `using` Statement, this should always be done with objects that inherit from `IDisposable`.\r\n\r\nYou can read about `IDisposable` and the `using` statement here:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/using-statement\r\n- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.idisposable\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/a/61131/2598770\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIf you have the values already in a `IEnumerable` object eg. `List&lt;int&gt;` than you can just do the following\r\n\r\nWith a simple loop:\r\n\r\n    var myValues = new List&lt;int&gt;() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }; //&lt;- list with temporary data\r\n    var sumOfValue = 0;\r\n    foreach (var myValue in myValues)\r\n         sumOfValue += myValue;\r\n\r\nWith `LINQ`:\r\n\r\n    var myValues = new List&lt;int&gt;() { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }; //&lt;- list with temporary data\r\n    var sumOfValue = myValues.Sum();\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t have an `IEnumerable` of `int` but instead a `class` than your code will look like this\r\n\r\n    public class MyValue\r\n    {\r\n        public int Value { get; set; }\r\n        //other properties\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var myValues = new List&lt;MyValue&gt;() \r\n                   { \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 1 }, \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 2 }, \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 3 }, \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 4 }, \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 5 }, \r\n                       new MyValue() { Value = 6 }, \r\n                   }; //&lt;- list with temporary data\r\n\r\nWith a simple loop:\r\n\r\n    var sumOfValue = 0;\r\n    foreach (var myValue in myValues)\r\n         sumOfValue += myValue.Value;\r\n\r\nWith `LINQ`:\r\n\r\n    var sumOfValue = myValues.Sum(x =&gt; x.Value);\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all those cases you will have to write `sumOfValue` into your `Label` or `TextBlock` like this\r\n\r\n    //Label\r\n    label1.Content = sumOfValue.ToString();\r\n    //or TextBlock\r\n    textBlock1.Text = sumOfValue.ToString();\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nTo pass a value to a different page, all you would need to do is the following.\r\n\r\nSearch for your page in code behind eg. `LeaderBoard`.\r\nIt should look something like this\r\n\r\n    public partial class LeaderBoard : Page\r\n    {\r\n        //stuff...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAdd a new Property to this class\r\n\r\n    public partial class LeaderBoard : Page\r\n    {\r\n        public int MyProperty { get; set; }\r\n        //stuff...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWhen you initialize the `LeaderBoard` eg. here\r\n\r\n    this.NavigationService.Navigate(new LeaderBoard());\r\n\r\nChange the initialization to this:\r\n\r\n    this.NavigationService.Navigate(new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, });\r\n\r\n`7187` is a random number this needs to be filled with what ever you need.\r\n\r\nWith this you have &quot;transfered&quot; data to `LeaderBoard` and the new property with its value can be accessed in `LeaderBoard` eg. there could be a method like this\r\n\r\n    public void Foo()\r\n    {\r\n        textBlock1.Text = Convert.ToString(this.MyProperty);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe class would than look like this:\r\n\r\n    public partial class LeaderBoard : Page\r\n    {\r\n        public int MyProperty { get; set; }\r\n        //stuff...\r\n    \r\n        public void Foo()\r\n        {\r\n            textBlock1.Text = Convert.ToString(this.MyProperty);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you need to change the `MyProperty` from a different place while the `LeaderBoard` is open keep the reference you have created.\r\n\r\nTo keep the reference change this line\r\n\r\n    this.NavigationService.Navigate(new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, });\r\n\r\nTo this\r\n\r\n    _leaderBoard = new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, };\r\n    this.NavigationService.Navigate(_leaderBoard);\r\n\r\nAnd create a `Field` in the outer scope like this\r\n\r\n    private LeaderBoard _leaderBoard; //&lt;- needs to be outside the method\r\n\r\n    private void Btn_LeaderB_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        _leaderBoard = new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, };\r\n        this.NavigationService.Navigate(_leaderBoard);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf `Btn_LeaderB_Click` gets called multiple times but you only want to create 1 LeaderBoard you can do this:\r\n\r\n    private void Btn_LeaderB_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        if (_leaderBoard == null)\r\n            _leaderBoard = new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, };\r\n    \r\n        this.NavigationService.Navigate(_leaderBoard);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nWith that the `_leaderBoard` field will only get initialized once.\r\nIf you want to increase the value `MyProperty` everytime the `Btn_LeaderB_Click` method gets called you can further extend it to this:\r\n\r\n    private void Btn_LeaderB_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n    {\r\n        if (_leaderBoard == null)\r\n            _leaderBoard = new LeaderBoard() { MyProperty = 7187, };\r\n        else\r\n            _leaderBoard.MyProperty += int.Parse(txt_score4_tm1.Text);\r\n    \r\n

This function is not causing any problem for you.\r\nNext is `tf.cond`. `tf.cond` expects a scalar value in it&#39;s predicate. To break down:\r\n\r\n    tensor = tf.constant([[0, 1, 0], [0.5, 0.5, 0.3]], tf.float32)\r\n    cond_val1 = tf.math.not_equal(tensor, 0.0)\r\n    print(cond_val1.shape)  # Shape (2, 3)\r\n\r\n`cond_val1` in above example is clearly a tensor. You will have to make use of `tf.reduce_all` or `tf.reduce_any` to convert it into a scalar. Then you will be getting a scalar as required for `tf.cond`. For ex:\r\n\r\n    cond_val2 = tf.reduce_all(tf.math.not_equal(tensor, 0.0))\r\n    print(cond_val2.shape)  # Shape ()\r\n\r\nNow this will make `tf.cond` work. But there is another problem you are getting. You have already lost your ability to process the tensor element-wise. \r\n\r\nSecondly, by means of `map_fn` you are passing the entire tensor split at first dimension which in your case will be `[0, 1, 0]` and `[0.5, 0.5, 0.3]`. But the problem is your `tf.cond`&#39;s `true_fn` and `false_fn` don&#39;t have ability to process it element-wise.\r\n\r\nHope you got to know the variety of problems which are present in your code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198538/computing-inverse-of-a-tensor-using-tf-map-fn/58201189#58201189","title":"Computing inverse of a Tensor using tf.map_fn"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11907949,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h7c7f7UZ6Q4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAF8/QOFeP5rfWXo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Azin Jahedi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11907949/azin-jahedi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2200,"user_id":5320802,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9sPEe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Regolith","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5320802/regolith"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570018039,"creation_date":1570007577,"last_edit_date":1570009820,"question_id":58198538,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58198538","body_markdown":"Using Tensorflow 1.4 I want to compute elementwise inverse (x --&gt; 1/x) of a tensor using map functions.

In order to perform some analysis, I need to clean my data. Therefore, my goal is to put the names just into lists like in row 4. \r\n\r\n**What i want**:\r\n```\r\n# From:\r\n[{&#39;surname&#39;: &#39;Sharafaldin&#39;, &#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Iman&#39;}, {&#39;surname&#39;: &#39;Lashkari&#39;, &#39;first_name&#39;: &#39;Arash Habibi&#39;}]\r\n\r\n# To:\r\n[Iman Sharafaldin, Arash Habibi Lashkari]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**My appraoch** is to createa two masks, one for the database column, extracting only `sciencedirect` papers and the other mask is the whole `authors` column. From these mask, a new dataframe is created, on which column &quot;authors&quot; i run the code shown below. It extracts the author names of each cell and stores them in a list, just as i want it:\r\n```\r\nscidir_mask = df[&quot;database&quot;] == &#39;sciencedirect&#39;\r\nauthors_col = df[&quot;authors&quot;] is not None\r\nonly_scidir = df[authors_col &amp; scidir_mask]\r\n\r\nfor cell in only_scidir[&quot;authors&quot;]:\r\n    # get each list from cell\r\n    cell_list = []\r\n    for dictionary in cell:\r\n        # get the values from dict and reverse into list\r\n        name_as_list = [*dictionary.values()][::-1]\r\n        # make list from first and surname a string\r\n        author = &#39; &#39;.join(name_as_list)\r\n        cell_list.append(author)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo at the end of the above code, the `cell_list` contains the authors names in the way I want.\r\nBut I can&#39;t get my head around, on how to store these `cell_lists` back into the original dataframe.\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nSo, how do I get the authors cell, where the database is `sciencedirect`,perform my little function and store the output of my function back into the cell?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58198526/run-function-on-cell-in-column-based-on-another-column","title":"Run function on cell in column, based on another column"},{"tags":["ios","swift","photokit"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2617,"user_id":3241041,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XgwSb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"alxlives","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3241041/alxlives"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570008741,"creation_date":1570008741,"answer_id":58198869,"question_id":58198525,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58198869","body_markdown":"This is because the first callback returns a thumbnail while the full size image is being loaded.\r\n\r\nFrom the [official Apple documentation:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/photokit/phimagemanager/1616964-requestimage)\r\n\r\n&gt; For an asynchronous request, Photos may call your result handler block more than once.

I have looked through as many as I could find and they are not duplicates. Please don&#39;t mark this as a duplicate.\r\n\r\nI have a Vue project set up with `vue create` that uses Babel and Typescript, I then generated some gRPC-Web / Protobuf code with this command:\r\n\r\n    cd src\r\n    protoc -I=../../protos ../../protos/foo.proto --js_out=import_style=typescript:. --grpc-web_out=import_style=typescript,mode=grpcweb:.\r\n\r\nThis generated these files in the `src` directory:\r\n\r\n* `foo_pb.d.ts` (the Typescript definitions for the Protobuf messages)\r\n* `empty.js`, `memory.js` (the Protobuf messages)\r\n* `FooServiceClientPb.ts` (the gRPC-web code)\r\n\r\nHowever when I `npm run serve` or `npm run build` I get this error:\r\n\r\n    This relative module was not found:\r\n\r\n    * ./foo_pb in ./src/main.ts, ./src/FooServiceClientPb.ts\r\n\r\nIn both `main.ts` and `FooServiceClientPb.ts` it does this:\r\n\r\n    import {Empty, Memory} from &#39;./foo_pb&#39;;\r\n\r\nI can ctrl-click `./foo_pb` and it opens `foo_pb.d.ts` correctly, so VSCode at least knows how to open that file.

Nothing works.\r\n\r\n## Edit 1\r\n\r\nI got a bit further by adding a `console.log()` in the bit where the error is generated (apparently Vue doesn&#39;t output the actual error, yeay).
