I was just going to use a simple boolean to toggle display the more row, using the showMoreDetail function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417006/expanding-a-tables-row-when-clicked-on-to-show-another-table","title":"Expanding a table&#39;s row when clicked on, to show another table"},{"tags":["linux","amazon-web-services","amazon-ec2","devops"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58732,"user_id":608639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPIhh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jww","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/608639/jww"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571253623,"post_id":58417005,"comment_id":103182849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417005/how-to-run-tmux-inside-userdata#comment103182849_58417005"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8608842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2fce4071c57b5dc5a6605453437a3e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Praveen Singhai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8608842/praveen-singhai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":58732,"user_id":608639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPIhh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jww","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/608639/jww"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571253629,"creation_date":1571240201,"last_edit_date":1571253629,"question_id":58417005,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417005","body_markdown":"I am trying to deploy a flask application at the launch of EC2 server through userdata using tmux.

few things I observe:\r\n\r\n 1. The submit button is wrapped in a form element, and I think you may need to `.Submit()` the form rather than `Click` the button. Both seem to work when I test it, though. See the HTML:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   &lt;form name=&quot;loginform&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; class=&quot;login-form&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;login-form-inner&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;field-wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;\r\n                    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; value=&quot;asdfadf&quot; maxlength=&quot;255&quot; class=&quot;input-block-level&quot; autofocus=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p class=&quot;text-error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;\r\n                    &lt;input class=&quot;btn btn-login btn-large&quot; id=&quot;submitBtn&quot; name=&quot;submitBtn&quot; value=&quot;Next&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;/p&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. You probably want to assign object variable to the username &amp; password elements\r\n 3. You may need to use the ready/waiting loop after each click/submit.\r\n 4. The `li` items use a relative path, so rather than comparing the full URL, your logic should probably also use the relative path:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    If li.className = &quot;top-level-menu-link&quot; And li.href = &quot;/smrs/AdhocReportControlServlet?hdn_function=SPECIMEN_SEARCH&amp;amp;hdn_function_type=REPORT_SEARCH&quot;\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n\r\nSince I can&#39;t get past the Username (I don&#39;t have a valid username of course), this is the best I can do:\r\n\r\n    Sub Test()\r\n    \r\n    Dim IE As Object\r\n    Dim doc As Object\r\n    \r\n    Set IE = CreateObject(&quot;InternetExplorer.Application&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    IE.Visible = True\r\n    IE.Navigate &quot;https://iuctsi-oncore-prod.forteresearchapps.com/smrs/AdhocReportControlServlet&quot;\r\n    \r\n    Call ReadyWaitingLoop(IE)\r\n    \r\n    Set doc = IE.Document\r\n    \r\n    Dim userEle As Object, pwEle As Object, submitBtn As Object, frm As Object\r\n    Set frm = doc.getElementsByClassName(&quot;login-form&quot;)(0)\r\n    Set userEle = doc.GetElementById(&quot;username&quot;)\r\n    userEle.Value = &quot;Username&quot; &#39; ## MODIFY to use a real username\r\n    Set submitBtn = doc.GetElementById(&quot;submitBtn&quot;)\r\n    frm.Submit  &#39; or submitBtn.Click -- not sure which is needed, both seem to work as tested\r\n    \r\n    Call ReadyWaitingLoop(IE)\r\n    \r\n    Set pwEle = doc.GetElementById(&quot;password&quot;)\r\n    Set submitBtn = doc.GetElementById(&quot;submitBtn&quot;)  &#39;## maybe case-sensitive\r\n    pwEle.Value = &quot;Password&quot;

is hardly first encounter I&#39;ve had with `&quot;1 timer(s) still in the queue&quot;`, but usually I find some way to use `tick()` or `detectChanges()`, etc., to get out of it.\r\n\r\nThe test below was working fine until I tried to test for a condition that I know should throw an exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  it(&#39;should be able to change case&#39;, fakeAsync(() =&gt; {\r\n    expect(component).toBeTruthy();\r\n\r\n    fixture.whenStable().then(fakeAsync(() =&gt; {\r\n      component.case = &#39;lower&#39;;\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      const input = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector(&#39;input&#39;) as HTMLInputElement;\r\n      typeInElement(&#39;abcDEF&#39;, input);\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      expect(component.text).toEqual(&#39;abcdef&#39;);\r\n\r\n      component.case = &#39;upper&#39;;\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      typeInElement(&#39;abcDEF&#39;, input);\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      expect(component.text).toEqual(&#39;ABCDEF&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // Everything above works fine. Here&#39;s where the trouble begins\r\n      expect(() =&gt; {\r\n        component.case = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n        fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n        tick(500);\r\n      }).toThrowError(/Invalid case attribute/);\r\n    }));\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m testing is an Angular component that&#39;s a wrapper around a Material input field. The component has many optional attributes, most of them just pass-through attributes for common input field features, but a few custom attributes too, like the one I&#39;m testing above for upper-/lowercase conversion.\r\n\r\nThe acceptable values for the `case` attribute are `upper`, `lower`, and `mixed` (with empty string, null, or undefined treated as `mixed`). The component should throw an exception for anything else. Apparently it does, and the test succeeds, but along with the success I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: &#39;Unhandled Promise rejection:&#39;, &#39;1 timer(s) still in the queue.&#39;, &#39;; Zone:&#39;, &#39;ProxyZone&#39;, &#39;; Task:&#39;, &#39;Promise.then&#39;, &#39;; Value:&#39;, Error: 1 timer(s) still in the queue.\r\nError: 1 timer(s) still in the queue.\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong, or a good way to flush out lingering timers?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: A big problem when I go looking for help with Karma unit tests is that, even when I explicitly search for &quot;karma&quot;, I mostly find answers for Pr0tractor, Pr0tractor, and more Pr0tractor. This isn&#39;t Pr0tractor! (Deliberately misspelled with a zero so it doesn&#39;t get search matches.)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I can work around my problem like this:\r\n```\r\n      expect(() =&gt; {\r\n        component.inputComp.case = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n      }).toThrowError(/Invalid camp-input case attribute/);\r\n```\r\nThis isn&#39;t as good of a test as assigning the (bad) value via an HTML attribute in the test component&#39;s template, because I&#39;m just forcing the value directly into the component&#39;s setter for the attribute itself, but it&#39;ll do until I have a better solution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416969/angular-karma-unit-test-error-1-timers-still-in-the-queue","title":"Angular/Karma unit test error &quot;1 timer(s) still in the queue&quot;"},{"tags":["input-devices"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12227557,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/665220be8bec035c6f28926221d25c6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amorgos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227557/amorgos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240087,"creation_date":1571240087,"question_id":58416967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416967","body_markdown":"I would like to customize a website.

was wondering if there are other methods to split columns or much better methods than these two \r\n\r\nI am going to put some code so we can talk the same language \r\n\r\n    --CREATING TABLE\r\n    CREATE TABLE BOOKS(\r\n    ID VARCHAR(MAX) NULL\r\n    ) \r\n    /*\r\n      BOOKS \r\n      PRODUCTID, NAME, PAGES, WEIGHT, SIZE, TYPE\r\n    */\r\n    INSERT INTO BOOKS (ID)\r\n    VALUES(&#39;B001,INTRODUCTION TO SQL,500,100G,MID,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B002,ADVANCED SQL SERVER PRACTICES,200,200G,BIG,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B003,SQL SERVER PERFORMANCE,1000,500G,BIG,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B004,SQL SERVER MANUAL,50,30G,SMALL,TECH&#39;)\r\n              ,(&#39;B004,SQL SERVER MANUAL,50,30G,SMALL,TECH&#39;)\r\n\r\nThat will be my demo table, as you can see I have a table with comma separated values\r\n\r\nFor splitting this values I am going to use pivot combined with a CTE \r\n\r\n    /*PIVOTING TABLE, ASIGNING A RN TO COLUMNS AND GETTING BACK VALUES*/\r\n    WITH C AS(\r\n    SELECT ID\r\n          ,value \r\n          ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) as rn\r\n    FROM BOOKS BO\r\n        CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(ID, &#39;,&#39;) AS BK\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT ID\r\n          ,[1] AS PRODUCTID\r\n          ,[2] AS NAME\r\n          ,[3] AS PAGES\r\n          ,[4] AS WEIGHT\r\n          ,[5] AS SIZE\r\n          ,[6] AS TYPE\r\n    FROM C\r\n    PIVOT(\r\n        MAX(VALUE)\r\n        FOR RN IN([1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6])  \r\n    ) as PVT\r\n\r\nIt works fine but in this case the order of strings that it returns is not guaranteed (Ex, 1,2,3,4). column1 = 1, column2 = 3 column3=2 column4 =4, and I am expecting to get 1,2,3,4\r\nThe other one is a well known here in stackoverflow by using XML and Nodes\r\n\r\nThe other one is a well known here in stackoverflow by using XML and Nodes\r\n\r\n    SELECT DISTINCT\r\n        S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[1]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;) AS PRODUCTID\r\n       ,S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[2]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;)  AS NAME\r\n       , S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[3]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;) AS PAGES\r\n       ,

to explain and a little confusing if you are not above the beginner level.\r\n\r\nWhat other better ways are there to split columns in sql server, do microsoft implement a new function for this or do you know another method for doing it. ?\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416940/is-there-a-more-efficient-way-to-slip-columns-than-pivoting-table-or-using-xml-a","title":"Is there a

combination and steps worked for me\r\n\r\n - scala 2.13.1 \r\n - Java OpenJDK 13.0.1 (set IntelliJ sbt options to OpenJDK)\r\n - sbt 1.3.3  (set IntelliJ sbt-launch.jar option to sbt 1.3.3 directory)\r\n\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n - create a new sample project in commandline (see https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html)\r\n - sbt compile, test should work\r\n - import this project in IntelliJ\r\n\r\nIntelliJ still shows the &quot;unknown artifact&quot; message but sbt compile, test works.\r\n\r\nI assume, that a newly installed IntelliJ had Problems to compile the scala2_12 bridge for Cousier.\r\n\r\nThe commandline recompiled, now I can see scalatest_2.13, which was missing before, in project directory\r\n\r\n

The code makes 2 calls to the api per address. Since there is a 2500/day limit it gets consumed fast. Is there a way to make the call for accuracy and accuracy type within a single call because acc to the documentation these just show up within the output dictionary of the original forward geocoding function itself. My objective is to make only 1 call per address.\r\n\r\nReprex of dataset(where address string is my only input in the above code):\r\n\r\n        customers[&#39;address_string&#39;]\r\n    Out[5]: \r\n    0         21236 Birchwood Loop, 99567, AK\r\n    1               1731 Bragaw St, 99508, AK\r\n    2            300 E Fireweed Ln, 99503, AK\r\n    3               4360 Snider Dr, 99654, AK\r\n    4     1921 W Dimond Blvd # 108, 99515, AK\r\n    5                2702 Peger Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    6              1651 College Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    7              898 Ballaine Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    8        23819 Immelman Circle, 99567, AK\r\n    9             9750 W Parks Hwy, 99652, AK\r\n    10           7205 Shorewood Dr, 99645, AK\r\n    Name: address_string, dtype: object","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416935/is-there-a-way-to-call-an-api-once-instead-of-twice-per-output-generated","title":"Is there a way to call an API once instead of twice per output generated?"},{"tags":["ios","swift","audio","swiftui"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":519,"user_id":5981293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e58f631b1e046d5251414624a998abc3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"krjw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5981293/krjw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571255486,"creation_date":1571255486,"answer_id":58420757,"question_id":58416934,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420757","body_markdown":"I would suggest something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nclass AudioModel: ObservableObject {\r\n    var audioPlayer: AVAudioPlayer?\r\n    \r\n    @Published current: String = &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n    var audioFiles = [&quot;audiofile1.mp3, audiofile2.mp3, audiofile3.mp3&quot;]\r\n    \r\n    func playSound() {\r\n\r\n        let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: self.current, ofType:nil)!\r\n        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)\r\n\r\n        do {\r\n            audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)\r\n            audioPlayer?.play()\r\n        } catch {\r\n            print(&quot;Could not find file&quot;)\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func stopSound() {\r\n        // Stop AVAudioPlayer\r\n        // audioPlayer.stop() ???\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    \r\n    @ObservedObject audioModel = AudioModel()\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            ForEach(self.audioModel, id: .\\self) { item in\r\n                Button(action:{ \r\n                        self.audioModel.current = item\r\n                    }) {\r\n                        Text(item) \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }.onReceive(self.audioModel.$current) {\r\n            self.audioModel.stopSound()\r\n            self.audioModel.playSound()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not finished because I couldn&#39;t test it but I hope this helps for further investigation.\r\n\r\n`@Published` is similar to `@State` and additionally creates a [Publisher][1] so whenever it is updated, the `onReceive()` call will be made.

However, I&#39;m struggling when trying to place outliers in the correct x-axis positions for each group of boxplots.\r\n\r\nBelow, I provide some example code\r\n\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(plotly)\r\nlibrary(data.table)\r\n\r\n# use summary data for plotly boxplots\r\n\r\n# Simulate data.\r\nn &lt;- 10e5\r\ndt &lt;- data.table(trait=rnorm(n),\r\n                 year=sample(2016:2019, n, replace=TRUE),\r\n                 line=factor(sample(letters[1:3], n, replace=TRUE)))\r\n\r\n# calculate summary data (summary + outliers) separately\r\nstats &lt;- dt[, boxplot.stats(trait)[1], by=.(year, line)]\r\nout &lt;- dt[, boxplot.stats(trait)[4], keyby=.(year, line)]\r\n\r\n# create and plot the BOXPLOT\r\nplot_ly() %&gt;%\r\n  add_trace(data=stats, x=~year, y=~stats, color=~line, type=&quot;box&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n  layout(boxmode=&quot;group&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n  add_markers(data=out, x=~year, y=~out, color=~line) %&gt;%\r\n  config(displayModeBar=FALSE, showTips=FALSE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is a boxplot by groups with outliers being placed on the same x-axis position for each year, but not sub-dividing for each line-group.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea how to make add_markers() place those pre-calculated outlier points in the correct positions in the boxplot???","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416928/r-plotly-cant-make-add-markers-function-to-match-positions-of-boxplot-boxes","title":"R Plotly: can&#39;t make add_markers() function to match positions of boxplot &quot;boxes&quot;"},{"tags":["python","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39821,"user_id":3483203,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/592wq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3483203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3483203/user3483203"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571240086,"post_id":58416927,"comment_id":103176717,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416927/pivoting-a-complex-pandas-dataframe-to-have-one-column-each-year#comment103176717_58416927"}],"owner":{"reputation":883,"user_id":2169327,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c9bad39b0964c92cc01cfdd8bb4753?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bjornasm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2169327/bjornasm"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571240098,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240665,"creation_date":1571239940,"question_id":58416927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416927","body_markdown":"I am at loss on how I should do this, my best bet is to reduce my dataframe more than I hope to need to do. \r\n\r\n    | Type | Year |Week number|Net Weight|\r\n     Apple   2019     1            10\r\n     Apple   2018     1            12\r\n     Pear    2018     1            52\r\n     Pear    2019     1            30\r\n\r\n\r\nI basically wants this to be like this:\r\n\r\n    | Type |Week number|2018(net weight)|2019(net weight)\r\n      Apple      1            12                10\r\n      Pear       1            52                30\r\n\r\n\r\nI have data for more or less all weeks every year, so Pandas won&#39;t let me simply pivot while using type and week number as index.

I&#39;m trying to clean things up, and want to hide some old projects that aren&#39;t in use, but I don&#39;t want to permanently delete them. \r\n\r\nUnbelievably, it seems that Jira Cloud doesn&#39;t have any sort archiving function. From what I&#39;ve read online, you can actually macgyver a solution using user groups/project roles and the global &#39;browse projects&#39; permission settings. I haven&#39;t been able to get this working thus far, but it&#39;s possible I&#39;m missing something obvious. Here&#39;s what I tried this afternoon:\r\n\r\n1. Set up an &#39;Everyone&#39; user group that includes everyone on my team\r\n2. Set up a project role called &#39;Active Projects&#39;\r\n3. Set the global &#39;browse projects&#39; permission settings so that only those people in an &#39;Active Projects&#39; role can view the project\r\n4. For a single project, I added the &#39;Everyone&#39; user group to an &#39;Active Projects&#39; role. \r\n\r\nTheoretically, this set up would allow everyone to only see this single project and not the rest, according to what I&#39;ve set in the &#39;browse projects&#39; permissions. But hey presto, no love. I can still view all projects. Possibly because I&#39;m a global admin? \r\n\r\nWould appreciate any pointers here.

I did some research in the [loaddata docs][1] and i saw that making some changes with the handlers of the related fields there should be a solution. Since it&#39;s my first time working with django i honestly don&#39;t know where should i apply this code in order to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nSo any help is more than welcomed. Thanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/2.2/ref/django-admin/#loaddata","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416917/django-loaddata-from-fixture-returns-error","title":"Django loaddata from fixture returns error"},{"tags":["python","numpy","math","scipy","numerical-methods"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37294,"user_id":7207392,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadc9567dde5f02b09a29695eca1ce40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Panzer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7207392/paul-panzer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571241582,"post_id":58416916,"comment_id":103177502,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416916/numpy-scipy-integrating-3d-array-of-points-or-convert-3d-array-of-points-to-an#comment103177502_58416916"}],"owner":{"reputation":358,"user_id":317563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac23a1535df11a2ed8a493594f3c0a0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mikkel Rev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/317563/mikkel-rev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":358,"user_id":317563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac23a1535df11a2ed8a493594f3c0a0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mikkel Rev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/317563/mikkel-rev"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240253,"creation_date":1571239915,"last_edit_date":1571240253,"question_id":58416916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416916","body_markdown":"I am using a complicated method (i.e. I cannot rewrite it in reasonable time) that returns a function represented as a 3D array.

The actual connection in _dayaLayer.Connection is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn new DBConnection(&quot;connectionString&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo matter what I do, it **always** commits. What am I doing wrong here? From what I have gathered online and from other answers on SO, as long as you open the connection in the transaction scope (which it does in the Task class), then it should be treated as one DB call. I&#39;ve tried multiple implementations and can&#39;t seem to get it working. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I&#39;ve got a program that aims to fill a 3D texture with values  starting from the top working its way down.  The program fills a sort of waterfall model. \r\n\r\nA function which takes the value associated with the cell in a 3D texture, and its position relative to the current cell, ie `f(x, position)` and produces a new value added to the current cell.  You can kind of think of it like a flood fill of sorts\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNow if I only needed the adjacent values, I could just use ghost points, the issue is that a single value spreads from its current location outwards, so adjacent values will be updated outside of what ever current block I&#39;m operating in.\r\n\r\nNow I don&#39;t need to transfer the entire block of data from adjacent blocks, I just need, at each step, the values of adjacent blocks surrounding the current grid. I&#39;ll still be using ghost points, but I&#39;ll need to transfer the &quot;new&quot; values in to use them. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nMy issue is that it appears that every one says &quot;use another compute shader invocation&quot; to get around this.  That isn&#39;t acceptable, there isn&#39;t enough work to justify the kernel startup cost. \r\n\r\nThe only options I see are:\r\n\r\n* use atomic ints to communicate across groups to let groups know they can use the value in some global memory which corresponds to these boundary data items\r\n* sextuple the run-time by copying values of adjacent cells into a separate buffer, then running the entire process over again to account for the new adjacent values for each side (there are 6 in a cube). \r\n* use only one group invocation for the entire thing. There may be enough other things that the GPU is doing to warrant this\r\n* using multiple compute shader invocations for each &quot;layer&quot; of the 3D texture, which would require dumping the values to global memory, then reading them back in for every layer, effectively doubling the cost of global memory reads and invoking kernel overhead as each kernel needs to be launched in order. If I could keep the same memory in shared memory between kernel invocations and not have to re-read it back in, this would mitigate the double latency issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there really no other way to copy boundaries in compute shaders?  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3CM2.png\r\n  [2]:

have a range of cells like the below:\r\n\r\n    Col A         | Col B      | Col C | Col D\r\n    apple, orange | red, green | 5     | 10\r\n    pear, banana  | blue       | 20    | 40\r\n\r\nI want to get a result that looks like:\r\n\r\n    Col A \r\n    apple-red-5-10\r\n    apple-green-5-10\r\n    orange-red-5-10\r\n    orange-green-5-10\r\n    pear-blue-20-40\r\n    banana-blue-20-40\r\n\r\nI am concatenating values in each row across multiple columns, but if a cell contains a comma separated list of an item, I need to treat each entry as if they belong in a new row with other column data included. \r\n\r\nI first reference the range belonging to the four columns I am interested in concatenating. \r\n\r\n    Dim cellRef1 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef1 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;I2:I60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef2 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef2 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;E2:E60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef3 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef3 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;D2:D60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef4 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef4 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;H2:H60&quot;)\r\n\r\nThen for the columns which would have comma separated entries (second and fourth), I create an array to store each value e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Dim Array_Two As Variant\r\n    Array_Two = cellRef2.Value\r\n\r\nSo I would have an array along the lines of\r\n\r\n     (&quot;apple, orange&quot;, &quot;pear,banana&quot;)\r\n\r\nI wanted to loop through each array to create a sub-array where I want to split the entries by a comma and store them in a new array.\r\n\r\ne.g. I want:\r\n\r\n    Array_Two_A = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)\r\n    Array_Two_B = (&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;banana)\r\n\r\nSo I can later access each entry and concatenate them.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do this using:\r\n\r\n    Dim Array_Two_New() As String\r\n\r\n    For x = LBound(Array_Two) To UBound(Array_Two)\r\n        Array_Two_New = Split(Array_Two(x, 1), &quot;,&quot;)\r\n    Next x\r\n\r\nWhich kind of works, but the problem is I can&#39;t figure out how to dynamically create an array that I can later access. \r\n\r\ne.g. as is my code will keep overwriting the Array_Two_New array with the first value the string in Array_Two(x,1) is split into. \r\n\r\nI thought I could add Array_Two_New(x) in my code so that I get a result like:\r\n\r\n    Array_Two_New(1) = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)\r\n    Array_Two_New(2) = (&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;)\r\n\r\nAnd I could later access the value I want e.g.\r\n \r\n    Array_Two_New(1)(1) = &quot;apple&quot;\r\n    Array_Two_New(1)(2) = &quot;orange&quot;\r\n    Array_Two_New(2)(1) = &quot;pear&quot; // etc.\r\n\r\nI think I&#39;m confusing the syntax here. \r\n\r\nI think I need to use an object but I am not too familiar with them.\r\n\r\nI found these articles but I couldn&#39;t follow the

Problem**\r\n\r\nWhen you tap on the `Widget` contained on `prefix`, the `TextFormField` will focus and the keyboard will appear. But since the `Widget` is a `DropdownButton`, when the `DropdownItems` are shown the keyboard is dismissed and strangely the `DropdownItems` are dismissed too. \r\n\r\nIf you try to use `PopupMenuButton` instead of `DropdownButton`, something similar happens: the keyboard is shown and then dismissed but in this case the `PopupMenuItems` aren&#39;t dismissed.

Visual Studio and .Net, I&#39;ve had to create and work with services for years.  One minor gripe/annoyance I&#39;ve had since the beginning of using services is that within Visual Studio when you either create a service or double-click on it&#39;s respective code file, it opens the service.cs file in &quot;Design View&quot;.  Ugh, ok... close the tab, right-click and then select &quot;View Code...&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhy is this even a thing?  Why did Microsoft take the time to create a `service.designer.cs` file for these classes?

With that being said, I am not asking for the answer, but I am asking more for some advice. In order to begin the project, I have decided to create a function called collatzSequencer that takes one argument type int. \r\n\r\nHere is my function prototype: \r\n```\r\nint collatzSequencer(int);\r\n```\r\nHere is my function definition: \r\n```\r\nint collatzSequencer(int n) {\r\n    int stepCounter = 0;\r\n    if (n % 2 == 0) {\r\n        stepCounter += 1;\r\n        collatzSequencer(n / 2);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (n % 2 == 1) {\r\n        stepCounter += 1;\r\n        collatzSequencer((3 * n) + 1);\r\n    }\r\n    else if (n == 1) {\r\n        printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, n);\r\n        printf(&quot;%d\\n&quot;, stepCounter);\r\n        return 0;\r\n```\r\nHere is where I call the function within my main function: \r\n```\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[]) {\r\n    int num = 5;\r\n    collatzSequencer(num);\r\n    return 0;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run my program, nothing happens and I exit with code 0. I have tried debugging my program, and I see that for some reason my IDE doesn&#39;t even run the collatzSequencer function when it is called.

First keep in mind that in memory storage is shared between storage and execution.  so doing big joins/etc that may require temp storage may be competing for memory space.  You may want to look at &quot;spark.memory.storageFraction&quot;  which currently defaults to 0.5 Consider 0.75 but this will likely slow down your queries.  Also consider applying good data engineering to the problem.  Reduce the amount of data that needs to be stored.  Create a temp view with old records removed and unneeded columns pruned, then cache that.  Consider using smaller datatypes for improved storage.  Ex ints are more space efficient than big strings. Lastly considering switching to an instance type that has more memory available or switching to an instance with fast local disks.  In some situations disk storage isn&#39;t that much slower than in memory.  This is particularly true if you&#39;re running big complicated analytical queries where the cluster is cpu bound and not io bound.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416788/apache-spark-cache-table-in-memory-is-spilling-over-to-disk/58421034#58421034","title":"apache-spark-Cache table in Memory is spilling over to disk"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12227462,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8641d09448101491817db66839f1bcd6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Srini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227462/srini"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571256762,"creation_date":1571239444,"question_id":58416788,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416788","body_markdown":"How to pin the table in cache so it would not swap out of memory?\r\n\r\n**Situation:** We are using **Microstrategy** BI reporting.

I&#39;m with debug mode &#39;on&#39; and this code does not show up any error.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417012/code-to-expand-search-box-to-a-custom-post-types-in-wordpress-admin-area","title":"Code to expand search box to a custom post types in WordPress admin area"},{"tags":["assembly","arm"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":431,"user_id":6012693,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5be83dfa8bf9e72bec3204f60fee1dbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tum_","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6012693/tum"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571241851,"post_id":58417010,"comment_id":103177620,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417010/initializing-negative-data-types-in-arm-assembly#comment103177620_58417010"},{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571249949,"post_id":58417010,"comment_id":103181236,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417010/initializing-negative-data-types-in-arm-assembly#comment103181236_58417010"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":16734,"user_id":1880339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0PkGx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"artless noise","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1880339/artless-noise"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571270772,"creation_date":1571270772,"answer_id":58423145,"question_id":58417010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58423145","body_markdown":"Using the gnu assembler, the following should work.\r\n\r\n        .text\r\n        start:\r\n            adr   r3,target   ; target address to r3\r\n            ldrsh r0,[r3],#2  ; ldrsh will sign extend\r\n            ldrsh r1,[r3]     ; .. and post increment to get the next.\r\n            add   r0,r0,r1    ; r0 = -2 + -3\r\n            bx    lr\r\n        target:\r\n           .short -2, -3\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417010/initializing-negative-data-types-in-arm-assembly/58423145#58423145","title":"Initializing Negative Data Types in ARM Assembly"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12223260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC-RZalIOsPATf9UDcxvAPVu6Xj4TU_cRVENF61JiI=k-s128","display_name":"Grand Locust","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12223260/grand-locust"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12223260,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mC-RZalIOsPATf9UDcxvAPVu6Xj4TU_cRVENF61JiI=k-s128","display_name":"Grand Locust","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12223260/grand-locust"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":51,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571270772,"creation_date":1571240204,"last_edit_date":1571253917,"question_id":58417010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417010","body_markdown":"I am currently struggling on how to set a negative/signed data type in ARM assembly via raspberry pi.

I was just going to use a simple boolean to toggle display the more row, using the showMoreDetail function.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417006/expanding-a-tables-row-when-clicked-on-to-show-another-table","title":"Expanding a table&#39;s row when clicked on, to show another table"},{"tags":["linux","amazon-web-services","amazon-ec2","devops"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58732,"user_id":608639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPIhh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jww","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/608639/jww"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571253623,"post_id":58417005,"comment_id":103182849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58417005/how-to-run-tmux-inside-userdata#comment103182849_58417005"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8608842,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f2fce4071c57b5dc5a6605453437a3e3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Praveen Singhai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8608842/praveen-singhai"},"last_editor":{"reputation":58732,"user_id":608639,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aPIhh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jww","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/608639/jww"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571253629,"creation_date":1571240201,"last_edit_date":1571253629,"question_id":58417005,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58417005","body_markdown":"I am trying to deploy a flask application at the launch of EC2 server through userdata using tmux.

few things I observe:\r\n\r\n 1. The submit button is wrapped in a form element, and I think you may need to `.Submit()` the form rather than `Click` the button. Both seem to work when I test it, though. See the HTML:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   &lt;form name=&quot;loginform&quot; method=&quot;post&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; class=&quot;login-form&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;div class=&quot;login-form-inner&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;field-wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;label for=&quot;username&quot;&gt;Username&lt;/label&gt;\r\n                    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;username&quot; id=&quot;username&quot; autocomplete=&quot;off&quot; value=&quot;asdfadf&quot; maxlength=&quot;255&quot; class=&quot;input-block-level&quot; autofocus=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p class=&quot;text-error&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;p&gt;\r\n                    &lt;input class=&quot;btn btn-login btn-large&quot; id=&quot;submitBtn&quot; name=&quot;submitBtn&quot; value=&quot;Next&quot; type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;/p&gt;\r\n            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        &lt;/form&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\n 2. You probably want to assign object variable to the username &amp; password elements\r\n 3. You may need to use the ready/waiting loop after each click/submit.\r\n 4. The `li` items use a relative path, so rather than comparing the full URL, your logic should probably also use the relative path:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    If li.className = &quot;top-level-menu-link&quot; And li.href = &quot;/smrs/AdhocReportControlServlet?hdn_function=SPECIMEN_SEARCH&amp;amp;hdn_function_type=REPORT_SEARCH&quot;\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n\r\nSince I can&#39;t get past the Username (I don&#39;t have a valid username of course), this is the best I can do:\r\n\r\n    Sub Test()\r\n    \r\n    Dim IE As Object\r\n    Dim doc As Object\r\n    \r\n    Set IE = CreateObject(&quot;InternetExplorer.Application&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    IE.Visible = True\r\n    IE.Navigate &quot;https://iuctsi-oncore-prod.forteresearchapps.com/smrs/AdhocReportControlServlet&quot;\r\n    \r\n    Call ReadyWaitingLoop(IE)\r\n    \r\n    Set doc = IE.Document\r\n    \r\n    Dim userEle As Object, pwEle As Object, submitBtn As Object, frm As Object\r\n    Set frm = doc.getElementsByClassName(&quot;login-form&quot;)(0)\r\n    Set userEle = doc.GetElementById(&quot;username&quot;)\r\n    userEle.Value = &quot;Username&quot; &#39; ## MODIFY to use a real username\r\n    Set submitBtn = doc.GetElementById(&quot;submitBtn&quot;)\r\n    frm.Submit  &#39; or submitBtn.Click -- not sure which is needed, both seem to work as tested\r\n    \r\n    Call ReadyWaitingLoop(IE)\r\n    \r\n    Set pwEle = doc.GetElementById(&quot;password&quot;)\r\n    Set submitBtn = doc.GetElementById(&quot;submitBtn&quot;)  &#39;## maybe case-sensitive\r\n    pwEle.Value = &quot;Password&quot;

is hardly first encounter I&#39;ve had with `&quot;1 timer(s) still in the queue&quot;`, but usually I find some way to use `tick()` or `detectChanges()`, etc., to get out of it.\r\n\r\nThe test below was working fine until I tried to test for a condition that I know should throw an exception:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  it(&#39;should be able to change case&#39;, fakeAsync(() =&gt; {\r\n    expect(component).toBeTruthy();\r\n\r\n    fixture.whenStable().then(fakeAsync(() =&gt; {\r\n      component.case = &#39;lower&#39;;\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      const input = fixture.nativeElement.querySelector(&#39;input&#39;) as HTMLInputElement;\r\n      typeInElement(&#39;abcDEF&#39;, input);\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      expect(component.text).toEqual(&#39;abcdef&#39;);\r\n\r\n      component.case = &#39;upper&#39;;\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      typeInElement(&#39;abcDEF&#39;, input);\r\n      fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n      tick(500);\r\n      expect(component.text).toEqual(&#39;ABCDEF&#39;);\r\n\r\n      // Everything above works fine. Here&#39;s where the trouble begins\r\n      expect(() =&gt; {\r\n        component.case = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n        fixture.autoDetectChanges();\r\n        tick(500);\r\n      }).toThrowError(/Invalid case attribute/);\r\n    }));\r\n  }));\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m testing is an Angular component that&#39;s a wrapper around a Material input field. The component has many optional attributes, most of them just pass-through attributes for common input field features, but a few custom attributes too, like the one I&#39;m testing above for upper-/lowercase conversion.\r\n\r\nThe acceptable values for the `case` attribute are `upper`, `lower`, and `mixed` (with empty string, null, or undefined treated as `mixed`). The component should throw an exception for anything else. Apparently it does, and the test succeeds, but along with the success I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nERROR: &#39;Unhandled Promise rejection:&#39;, &#39;1 timer(s) still in the queue.&#39;, &#39;; Zone:&#39;, &#39;ProxyZone&#39;, &#39;; Task:&#39;, &#39;Promise.then&#39;, &#39;; Value:&#39;, Error: 1 timer(s) still in the queue.\r\nError: 1 timer(s) still in the queue.\r\n   ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong, or a good way to flush out lingering timers?\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: A big problem when I go looking for help with Karma unit tests is that, even when I explicitly search for &quot;karma&quot;, I mostly find answers for Pr0tractor, Pr0tractor, and more Pr0tractor. This isn&#39;t Pr0tractor! (Deliberately misspelled with a zero so it doesn&#39;t get search matches.)\r\n\r\nUPDATE: I can work around my problem like this:\r\n```\r\n      expect(() =&gt; {\r\n        component.inputComp.case = &#39;foo&#39;;\r\n      }).toThrowError(/Invalid camp-input case attribute/);\r\n```\r\nThis isn&#39;t as good of a test as assigning the (bad) value via an HTML attribute in the test component&#39;s template, because I&#39;m just forcing the value directly into the component&#39;s setter for the attribute itself, but it&#39;ll do until I have a better solution.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416969/angular-karma-unit-test-error-1-timers-still-in-the-queue","title":"Angular/Karma unit test error &quot;1 timer(s) still in the queue&quot;"},{"tags":["input-devices"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12227557,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/665220be8bec035c6f28926221d25c6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amorgos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12227557/amorgos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240087,"creation_date":1571240087,"question_id":58416967,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416967","body_markdown":"I would like to customize a website.

was wondering if there are other methods to split columns or much better methods than these two \r\n\r\nI am going to put some code so we can talk the same language \r\n\r\n    --CREATING TABLE\r\n    CREATE TABLE BOOKS(\r\n    ID VARCHAR(MAX) NULL\r\n    ) \r\n    /*\r\n      BOOKS \r\n      PRODUCTID, NAME, PAGES, WEIGHT, SIZE, TYPE\r\n    */\r\n    INSERT INTO BOOKS (ID)\r\n    VALUES(&#39;B001,INTRODUCTION TO SQL,500,100G,MID,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B002,ADVANCED SQL SERVER PRACTICES,200,200G,BIG,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B003,SQL SERVER PERFORMANCE,1000,500G,BIG,TECH&#39;)\r\n          ,(&#39;B004,SQL SERVER MANUAL,50,30G,SMALL,TECH&#39;)\r\n              ,(&#39;B004,SQL SERVER MANUAL,50,30G,SMALL,TECH&#39;)\r\n\r\nThat will be my demo table, as you can see I have a table with comma separated values\r\n\r\nFor splitting this values I am going to use pivot combined with a CTE \r\n\r\n    /*PIVOTING TABLE, ASIGNING A RN TO COLUMNS AND GETTING BACK VALUES*/\r\n    WITH C AS(\r\n    SELECT ID\r\n          ,value \r\n          ,ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ID ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) as rn\r\n    FROM BOOKS BO\r\n        CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(ID, &#39;,&#39;) AS BK\r\n    )\r\n    SELECT ID\r\n          ,[1] AS PRODUCTID\r\n          ,[2] AS NAME\r\n          ,[3] AS PAGES\r\n          ,[4] AS WEIGHT\r\n          ,[5] AS SIZE\r\n          ,[6] AS TYPE\r\n    FROM C\r\n    PIVOT(\r\n        MAX(VALUE)\r\n        FOR RN IN([1],[2],[3],[4],[5],[6])  \r\n    ) as PVT\r\n\r\nIt works fine but in this case the order of strings that it returns is not guaranteed (Ex, 1,2,3,4). column1 = 1, column2 = 3 column3=2 column4 =4, and I am expecting to get 1,2,3,4\r\nThe other one is a well known here in stackoverflow by using XML and Nodes\r\n\r\nThe other one is a well known here in stackoverflow by using XML and Nodes\r\n\r\n    SELECT DISTINCT\r\n        S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[1]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;) AS PRODUCTID\r\n       ,S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[2]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;)  AS NAME\r\n       , S.a.value(&#39;(/H/r)[3]&#39;, &#39;VARCHAR(100)&#39;) AS PAGES\r\n       ,

to explain and a little confusing if you are not above the beginner level.\r\n\r\nWhat other better ways are there to split columns in sql server, do microsoft implement a new function for this or do you know another method for doing it. ?\r\n ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416940/is-there-a-more-efficient-way-to-slip-columns-than-pivoting-table-or-using-xml-a","title":"Is there a

combination and steps worked for me\r\n\r\n - scala 2.13.1 \r\n - Java OpenJDK 13.0.1 (set IntelliJ sbt options to OpenJDK)\r\n - sbt 1.3.3  (set IntelliJ sbt-launch.jar option to sbt 1.3.3 directory)\r\n\r\nsteps:\r\n\r\n - create a new sample project in commandline (see https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html)\r\n - sbt compile, test should work\r\n - import this project in IntelliJ\r\n\r\nIntelliJ still shows the &quot;unknown artifact&quot; message but sbt compile, test works.\r\n\r\nI assume, that a newly installed IntelliJ had Problems to compile the scala2_12 bridge for Cousier.\r\n\r\nThe commandline recompiled, now I can see scalatest_2.13, which was missing before, in project directory\r\n\r\n

The code makes 2 calls to the api per address. Since there is a 2500/day limit it gets consumed fast. Is there a way to make the call for accuracy and accuracy type within a single call because acc to the documentation these just show up within the output dictionary of the original forward geocoding function itself. My objective is to make only 1 call per address.\r\n\r\nReprex of dataset(where address string is my only input in the above code):\r\n\r\n        customers[&#39;address_string&#39;]\r\n    Out[5]: \r\n    0         21236 Birchwood Loop, 99567, AK\r\n    1               1731 Bragaw St, 99508, AK\r\n    2            300 E Fireweed Ln, 99503, AK\r\n    3               4360 Snider Dr, 99654, AK\r\n    4     1921 W Dimond Blvd # 108, 99515, AK\r\n    5                2702 Peger Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    6              1651 College Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    7              898 Ballaine Rd, 99709, AK\r\n    8        23819 Immelman Circle, 99567, AK\r\n    9             9750 W Parks Hwy, 99652, AK\r\n    10           7205 Shorewood Dr, 99645, AK\r\n    Name: address_string, dtype: object","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416935/is-there-a-way-to-call-an-api-once-instead-of-twice-per-output-generated","title":"Is there a way to call an API once instead of twice per output generated?"},{"tags":["ios","swift","audio","swiftui"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":519,"user_id":5981293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e58f631b1e046d5251414624a998abc3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"krjw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5981293/krjw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571255486,"creation_date":1571255486,"answer_id":58420757,"question_id":58416934,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420757","body_markdown":"I would suggest something like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nclass AudioModel: ObservableObject {\r\n    var audioPlayer: AVAudioPlayer?\r\n    \r\n    @Published current: String = &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n    var audioFiles = [&quot;audiofile1.mp3, audiofile2.mp3, audiofile3.mp3&quot;]\r\n    \r\n    func playSound() {\r\n\r\n        let path = Bundle.main.path(forResource: self.current, ofType:nil)!\r\n        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: path)\r\n\r\n        do {\r\n            audioPlayer = try AVAudioPlayer(contentsOf: url)\r\n            audioPlayer?.play()\r\n        } catch {\r\n            print(&quot;Could not find file&quot;)\r\n\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    func stopSound() {\r\n        // Stop AVAudioPlayer\r\n        // audioPlayer.stop() ???\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nstruct ContentView: View {\r\n    \r\n    @ObservedObject audioModel = AudioModel()\r\n    \r\n    var body: some View {\r\n        VStack {\r\n            ForEach(self.audioModel, id: .\\self) { item in\r\n                Button(action:{ \r\n                        self.audioModel.current = item\r\n                    }) {\r\n                        Text(item) \r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }.onReceive(self.audioModel.$current) {\r\n            self.audioModel.stopSound()\r\n            self.audioModel.playSound()\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s not finished because I couldn&#39;t test it but I hope this helps for further investigation.\r\n\r\n`@Published` is similar to `@State` and additionally creates a [Publisher][1] so whenever it is updated, the `onReceive()` call will be made.

However, I&#39;m struggling when trying to place outliers in the correct x-axis positions for each group of boxplots.\r\n\r\nBelow, I provide some example code\r\n\r\n```R\r\nlibrary(plotly)\r\nlibrary(data.table)\r\n\r\n# use summary data for plotly boxplots\r\n\r\n# Simulate data.\r\nn &lt;- 10e5\r\ndt &lt;- data.table(trait=rnorm(n),\r\n                 year=sample(2016:2019, n, replace=TRUE),\r\n                 line=factor(sample(letters[1:3], n, replace=TRUE)))\r\n\r\n# calculate summary data (summary + outliers) separately\r\nstats &lt;- dt[, boxplot.stats(trait)[1], by=.(year, line)]\r\nout &lt;- dt[, boxplot.stats(trait)[4], keyby=.(year, line)]\r\n\r\n# create and plot the BOXPLOT\r\nplot_ly() %&gt;%\r\n  add_trace(data=stats, x=~year, y=~stats, color=~line, type=&quot;box&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n  layout(boxmode=&quot;group&quot;) %&gt;%\r\n  add_markers(data=out, x=~year, y=~out, color=~line) %&gt;%\r\n  config(displayModeBar=FALSE, showTips=FALSE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThe result is a boxplot by groups with outliers being placed on the same x-axis position for each year, but not sub-dividing for each line-group.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea how to make add_markers() place those pre-calculated outlier points in the correct positions in the boxplot???","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416928/r-plotly-cant-make-add-markers-function-to-match-positions-of-boxplot-boxes","title":"R Plotly: can&#39;t make add_markers() function to match positions of boxplot &quot;boxes&quot;"},{"tags":["python","pandas","dataframe"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39821,"user_id":3483203,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/592wq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user3483203","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3483203/user3483203"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571240086,"post_id":58416927,"comment_id":103176717,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416927/pivoting-a-complex-pandas-dataframe-to-have-one-column-each-year#comment103176717_58416927"}],"owner":{"reputation":883,"user_id":2169327,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/66c9bad39b0964c92cc01cfdd8bb4753?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"bjornasm","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2169327/bjornasm"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571240098,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240665,"creation_date":1571239940,"question_id":58416927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416927","body_markdown":"I am at loss on how I should do this, my best bet is to reduce my dataframe more than I hope to need to do. \r\n\r\n    | Type | Year |Week number|Net Weight|\r\n     Apple   2019     1            10\r\n     Apple   2018     1            12\r\n     Pear    2018     1            52\r\n     Pear    2019     1            30\r\n\r\n\r\nI basically wants this to be like this:\r\n\r\n    | Type |Week number|2018(net weight)|2019(net weight)\r\n      Apple      1            12                10\r\n      Pear       1            52                30\r\n\r\n\r\nI have data for more or less all weeks every year, so Pandas won&#39;t let me simply pivot while using type and week number as index.

I&#39;m trying to clean things up, and want to hide some old projects that aren&#39;t in use, but I don&#39;t want to permanently delete them. \r\n\r\nUnbelievably, it seems that Jira Cloud doesn&#39;t have any sort archiving function. From what I&#39;ve read online, you can actually macgyver a solution using user groups/project roles and the global &#39;browse projects&#39; permission settings. I haven&#39;t been able to get this working thus far, but it&#39;s possible I&#39;m missing something obvious. Here&#39;s what I tried this afternoon:\r\n\r\n1. Set up an &#39;Everyone&#39; user group that includes everyone on my team\r\n2. Set up a project role called &#39;Active Projects&#39;\r\n3. Set the global &#39;browse projects&#39; permission settings so that only those people in an &#39;Active Projects&#39; role can view the project\r\n4. For a single project, I added the &#39;Everyone&#39; user group to an &#39;Active Projects&#39; role. \r\n\r\nTheoretically, this set up would allow everyone to only see this single project and not the rest, according to what I&#39;ve set in the &#39;browse projects&#39; permissions. But hey presto, no love. I can still view all projects. Possibly because I&#39;m a global admin? \r\n\r\nWould appreciate any pointers here.

I did some research in the [loaddata docs][1] and i saw that making some changes with the handlers of the related fields there should be a solution. Since it&#39;s my first time working with django i honestly don&#39;t know where should i apply this code in order to solve the problem.\r\n\r\nSo any help is more than welcomed. Thanks in advance\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/es/2.2/ref/django-admin/#loaddata","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416917/django-loaddata-from-fixture-returns-error","title":"Django loaddata from fixture returns error"},{"tags":["python","numpy","math","scipy","numerical-methods"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37294,"user_id":7207392,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dadc9567dde5f02b09a29695eca1ce40?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Paul Panzer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7207392/paul-panzer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571241582,"post_id":58416916,"comment_id":103177502,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58416916/numpy-scipy-integrating-3d-array-of-points-or-convert-3d-array-of-points-to-an#comment103177502_58416916"}],"owner":{"reputation":358,"user_id":317563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac23a1535df11a2ed8a493594f3c0a0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mikkel Rev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/317563/mikkel-rev"},"last_editor":{"reputation":358,"user_id":317563,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ac23a1535df11a2ed8a493594f3c0a0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mikkel Rev","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/317563/mikkel-rev"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571240253,"creation_date":1571239915,"last_edit_date":1571240253,"question_id":58416916,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58416916","body_markdown":"I am using a complicated method (i.e. I cannot rewrite it in reasonable time) that returns a function represented as a 3D array.

The actual connection in _dayaLayer.Connection is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreturn new DBConnection(&quot;connectionString&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo matter what I do, it **always** commits. What am I doing wrong here? From what I have gathered online and from other answers on SO, as long as you open the connection in the transaction scope (which it does in the Task class), then it should be treated as one DB call. I&#39;ve tried multiple implementations and can&#39;t seem to get it working. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.

I&#39;ve got a program that aims to fill a 3D texture with values  starting from the top working its way down.  The program fills a sort of waterfall model. \r\n\r\nA function which takes the value associated with the cell in a 3D texture, and its position relative to the current cell, ie `f(x, position)` and produces a new value added to the current cell.  You can kind of think of it like a flood fill of sorts\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nNow if I only needed the adjacent values, I could just use ghost points, the issue is that a single value spreads from its current location outwards, so adjacent values will be updated outside of what ever current block I&#39;m operating in.\r\n\r\nNow I don&#39;t need to transfer the entire block of data from adjacent blocks, I just need, at each step, the values of adjacent blocks surrounding the current grid. I&#39;ll still be using ghost points, but I&#39;ll need to transfer the &quot;new&quot; values in to use them. \r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nMy issue is that it appears that every one says &quot;use another compute shader invocation&quot; to get around this.  That isn&#39;t acceptable, there isn&#39;t enough work to justify the kernel startup cost. \r\n\r\nThe only options I see are:\r\n\r\n* use atomic ints to communicate across groups to let groups know they can use the value in some global memory which corresponds to these boundary data items\r\n* sextuple the run-time by copying values of adjacent cells into a separate buffer, then running the entire process over again to account for the new adjacent values for each side (there are 6 in a cube). \r\n* use only one group invocation for the entire thing. There may be enough other things that the GPU is doing to warrant this\r\n* using multiple compute shader invocations for each &quot;layer&quot; of the 3D texture, which would require dumping the values to global memory, then reading them back in for every layer, effectively doubling the cost of global memory reads and invoking kernel overhead as each kernel needs to be launched in order. If I could keep the same memory in shared memory between kernel invocations and not have to re-read it back in, this would mitigate the double latency issue. \r\n\r\n\r\nIs there really no other way to copy boundaries in compute shaders?  \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/q3CM2.png\r\n  [2]:

have a range of cells like the below:\r\n\r\n    Col A         | Col B      | Col C | Col D\r\n    apple, orange | red, green | 5     | 10\r\n    pear, banana  | blue       | 20    | 40\r\n\r\nI want to get a result that looks like:\r\n\r\n    Col A \r\n    apple-red-5-10\r\n    apple-green-5-10\r\n    orange-red-5-10\r\n    orange-green-5-10\r\n    pear-blue-20-40\r\n    banana-blue-20-40\r\n\r\nI am concatenating values in each row across multiple columns, but if a cell contains a comma separated list of an item, I need to treat each entry as if they belong in a new row with other column data included. \r\n\r\nI first reference the range belonging to the four columns I am interested in concatenating. \r\n\r\n    Dim cellRef1 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef1 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;I2:I60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef2 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef2 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;E2:E60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef3 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef3 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;D2:D60&quot;)\r\n    Dim cellRef4 As Range\r\n    Set cellRef4 = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets(1).Range(&quot;H2:H60&quot;)\r\n\r\nThen for the columns which would have comma separated entries (second and fourth), I create an array to store each value e.g.:\r\n\r\n    Dim Array_Two As Variant\r\n    Array_Two = cellRef2.Value\r\n\r\nSo I would have an array along the lines of\r\n\r\n     (&quot;apple, orange&quot;, &quot;pear,banana&quot;)\r\n\r\nI wanted to loop through each array to create a sub-array where I want to split the entries by a comma and store them in a new array.\r\n\r\ne.g. I want:\r\n\r\n    Array_Two_A = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)\r\n    Array_Two_B = (&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;banana)\r\n\r\nSo I can later access each entry and concatenate them.\r\n\r\nI wanted to do this using:\r\n\r\n    Dim Array_Two_New() As String\r\n\r\n    For x = LBound(Array_Two) To UBound(Array_Two)\r\n        Array_Two_New = Split(Array_Two(x, 1), &quot;,&quot;)\r\n    Next x\r\n\r\nWhich kind of works, but the problem is I can&#39;t figure out how to dynamically create an array that I can later access. \r\n\r\ne.g. as is my code will keep overwriting the Array_Two_New array with the first value the string in Array_Two(x,1) is split into. \r\n\r\nI thought I could add Array_Two_New(x) in my code so that I get a result like:\r\n\r\n    Array_Two_New(1) = (&quot;apple&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;)\r\n    Array_Two_New(2) = (&quot;pear&quot;, &quot;banana&quot;)\r\n\r\nAnd I could later access the value I want e.g.\r\n \r\n    Array_Two_New(1)(1) = &quot;apple&quot;\r\n    Array_Two_New(1)(2) = &quot;orange&quot;\r\n    Array_Two_New(2)(1) = &quot;pear&quot; // etc.\r\n\r\nI think I&#39;m confusing the syntax here. \r\n\r\nI think I need to use an object but I am not too familiar with them.\r\n\r\nI found these articles but I couldn&#39;t follow the

Problem**\r\n\r\nWhen you tap on the `Widget` contained on `prefix`, the `TextFormField` will focus and the keyboard will appear. But since the `Widget` is a `DropdownButton`, when the `DropdownItems` are shown the keyboard is dismissed and strangely the `DropdownItems` are dismissed too. \r\n\r\nIf you try to use `PopupMenuButton` instead of `DropdownButton`, something similar happens: the keyboard is shown and then dismissed but in this case the `PopupMenuItems` aren&#39;t dismissed.

Visual Studio and .Net, I&#39;ve had to create and work with services for years.  One minor gripe/annoyance I&#39;ve had since the beginning of using services is that within Visual Studio when you either create a service or double-click on it&#39;s respective code file, it opens the service.cs file in &quot;Design View&quot;.  Ugh, ok... close the tab, right-click and then select &quot;View Code...&quot;.\r\n\r\nWhy is this even a thing?  Why did Microsoft take the time to create a `service.designer.cs` file for these classes?
