The final table should look like this:\r\n\r\n    ID    Name    Age   Start    Status1    Status2    Status3    Status4    Status5   Status6\r\n    01    John     45    2011         25         13         13         12         34        35\r\n    02    Mike     23    2017         24         12         15         18         45        32\r\n    03   Peter     34    2019         11         13         13         34         12        15\r\n    04   Sarah     21    2020         42         43         44         45         46        47\r\n\r\nAs you can hopefully see, the row for ID 01 remains unchanged.  For ID 02, the old Status values have shifted one to the right, and Status1 has been replaced.  For IDs 03 and 04, the old Status values have shifted three places to the right, and Status1 to Status3 have been replaced.  As you can see, the old values that were in Status4 to Status6 have been removed.\r\n\r\nI am quite stuck with this.  So far I have tried to make some rules around the replacements as follows:\r\n\r\n  1) If Year is more than 3 years from the current year (2019), then leave the Status column names as they are. e.g. row 1 of Table1.\r\n\r\n2) If Start is 2019 or greater, rename the Status columns by adding 3. e.g in rows 3 and 4 of Table1, Status1 should be renamed Status4, and so on.  The last 3 Status columns (Status4 to Status6) would be deleted.\r\n\r\n3) If Start is within 3 years of 2019 (i.e. 2017 to 2019), then rename the Status columns by adding the difference between 2016 and Start. e.g. in row 2 of Table1, Status1 would be renamed Status2 and so on. The last column (Status6) would be deleted.\r\n\r\nI could code these using if / else, but I&#39;m not sure how to fit these within a data wrangling pipe with select() and left_join() to carry out these changes successfully.  I am using R, but could use SQL too if it was easier. Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\np.s. I appreciate that the resulting table is in a strange format, but unfortunately that is what I need to produce.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081036/join-tables-shifting-or-renaming-existing-columns-based-on-value-in-another-col","title":"Join tables, shifting or renaming existing columns based on value in another column"},{"tags":["java","selenium-webdriver","xpath","css-selectors","autosuggest"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":11840166,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54681e044f10d703629ec223c3ba310d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"krina","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11840166/krina"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569330544,"post_id":58081035,"comment_id":102556355,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081035/how-to-select-the-first-auto-suggestion-using-selenium-and-java#comment102556355_58081035"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":73,"user_id":5436436,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a1c8b32a72c538a927c31abf81e5194?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M3hdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5436436/m3hdi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":73,"user_id":5436436,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a1c8b32a72c538a927c31abf81e5194?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"M3hdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5436436/m3hdi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569333788,"last_edit_date":1569333788,"creation_date":1569332548,"answer_id":58081708,"question_id":58081035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58081708","body_markdown":"1- First enter your word in the search box. \r\n\r\n2- then wait until the Elements of your search are visible or clickable. \r\n\r\n     \r\n     WebDriverWait wait = new WebDriverWait(driver, milliseconds);\r\n     wait.until(ExpectedConditions.elementToBeClickable(driver.findElement(By.xpath(&quot;//li[@id=&#39;indexTab1&#39;]&quot;))));\r\n\r\n3- then click on the desired element\r\n\r\n    driver.findElement(By.xpath(&quot;//li[@id=&#39;indexTab1&#39;]&quot;)).click();\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081035/how-to-select-the-first-auto-suggestion-using-selenium-and-java/58081708#58081708","title":"How to select the first auto suggestion using Selenium and Java"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":62610,"user_id":7429447,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fZMSv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"DebanjanB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7429447/debanjanb"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1569339554,"creation_date":1569339554,"answer_id":58083831,"question_id":58081035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58083831","body_markdown":"Once you invoke `sendKeys()` with the desired text, to select the first auto suggestion you need to induce _WebDriverWait_ for the `visibilityOfElementLocated()` and you can use either of the following [Locator Strategies](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48369043/official-locator-strategies-for-the-webdriver/48376890#48376890):\r\n\r\n- `cssSelector`:\r\n\r\n\t    driver.findElement(By.className(&quot;searchfilter&quot;)).sendKeys(&quot;Abilify&quot;);\r\n\t    new WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.cssSelector(&quot;li.list-group-item-action[name=&#39;ABILIFY - ARIPIPRAZOLE&#39;][href$=&#39;-ABILIFY&#39;]&quot;))).click();\r\n           \t\r\n- `xpath`:\r\n\r\n\t    driver.findElement(By.className(&quot;searchfilter&quot;)).sendKeys(&quot;Abilify&quot;);\r\n\t    new WebDriverWait(driver, 20).until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated(By.xpath(&quot;//li[contains(@class, &#39;list-group-item-action&#39;) and @name=&#39;ABILIFY - ARIPIPRAZOLE&#39;][contains(., &#39;ABILIFY - ARIPIPRAZOLE&#39;)]&quot;))).click();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081035/how-to-select-the-first-auto-suggestion-using-selenium-and-java/58083831#58083831","title":"How to select the first auto suggestion using Selenium and Java"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9717780,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6bfe278f40c5d36942ad63561ac678ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Partha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9717780/partha"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569354937,"creation_date":1569354937,"answer_id":58087340,"question_id":58081035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58087340","body_markdown":"I think, yours is single page application.

For example:\r\n\r\n    $topics = [\r\n        &#39;Opening&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Aanwezigen&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Opmerkingen vorige notulen&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Ingezonden stukken&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;Jaarverslag 2019&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Jaarcijfers 2019&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;Jaarcijfers info&#39;,\r\n            ],\r\n         ],\r\n        &#39;Jaarrekening 2019&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;Voorstel tot vaststelling van de jaarcijfers 2019 (stempunt)&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Vaststelling dividenduitkering (stempunt)&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Bespreking reserverings- en dividendbeleid&#39;,\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;Rondvraag&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Afsluiting&#39;,\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n\r\n    $notes = [\r\n        &#39;Opening: notes&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Aanwezigen: notes&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Opmerkingen vorige notulen: notes&#39;,`\r\n        &#39;Ingezonden stukken: notes&#39; =&gt; \r\n            &#39;Jaarverslag 2019: notes&#39;,\r\n            &#39;Jaarcijfers 2019: notes&#39; =&gt; [\r\n                &#39;Jaarcijfers info: notes&#39;,\r\n    \t],\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;Jaarrekening 2019: notes&#39; =&gt; [\r\n            &#39;Voorstel tot vaststelling van de jaarcijfers 2019 (stempunt): notes&#39;,\r\n    \t&#39;Vaststelling didividenduitkering (stempunt): notes&#39;,\r\n    \t&#39;Bespreking reserverings- en didividendbeleid: notes&#39;,\r\n        ],\r\n        &#39;Rondvraag: notes&#39;,\r\n        &#39;Afsluiting: notes&#39;\r\n    ];\r\n\r\nThe preferred output would be like this:\r\n\r\n    Opening\r\n    Opening: notes\r\n    \r\n    Aanwezigen\r\n    Aanwezigen: notes\r\n    \r\n    Opmerkingen vorige notulen\r\n    Opmerkingen vorige notulen: notes\r\n\r\nSo the indexes of both array should be paired with each other. Like `Opening` with `Opening: notes` and `Aanwezigen` with `Aanwezigen: notes`. \r\n\r\nI already tried this:\r\n\r\n    $iterator = new MultipleIterator();\r\n    $iterator-&gt;attachIterator(new ArrayIterator($topics));\r\n    $iterator-&gt;attachIterator(new ArrayIterator($notes));\r\n    foreach($iterator as $topicMinute) {\r\n        echo $topicMinute[0] . &quot;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;\r\n        echo $topicMinute[1] . &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works for non-nested arrays but not for the ones I am currently using. It gives me this error: \r\n\r\n&gt; Array to string conversion.\r\n\r\nAny ideas on how I might implement this the best way? So the idea is that the file I&#39;m working in receives two arrays, with the same &#39;lay-out&#39; and to pair these to loop through it in one `foreach`. Maybe I should use something else than an `ArrayIterator`. Any help is appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081017/multi-level-nested-array-pairing","title":"Multi-level nested array

It&#39;s very likely that **apt-get install openjdk7-xxx** fails because there are few repositories that still have it. Check again if the packages are installed correctly.\r\n 2. Double check that the path to the jdk is correct. Try to run java -version from that directory to verify the version. It must say &quot;1.7.xx&quot;\r\n 3. The **JAVA_HOME** is probably in your .bashrc, not that of the user pentaho. Check it. Even better, go and **hack the start-pentaho.sh script and set it there**, just before the actual call to start tomcat server.\r\n 4. CD to pentaho-server folder and run ./start-pentaho.sh Check the logging output to the console window and tomcat/logs/catalina.out for errors and try to solve them. \r\n 5.

New file being created &quot;);\r\n            trackerFile.createNewFile();\t\t\t\t\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        }\r\n    } else {\r\n        try {\r\n            SimpleDateFormat df = new SimpleDateFormat(&quot;yyyy-MM-dd&quot;);\r\n            String dateCreated = df.format(this.getCreationTime(trackerFile).toMillis());\r\n            logger.debug(&quot;File exists file creation time is {}&quot; , dateCreated);\r\n            Calendar currCalendar = Calendar.getInstance();\r\n            Calendar fileCreateCalendar = Calendar.getInstance();\r\n            fileCreateCalendar.setTime(df.parse(dateCreated));\r\n            if (currCalendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) &gt; fileCreateCalendar.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH)) {\r\n                logger.debug(&quot;File exists file not created today , being deleted&quot;);\r\n                trackerFile.delete();\r\n                trackerFile.createNewFile();\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (ParseException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        } catch (IOException e) {\r\n            e.printStackTrace();\r\n        } \r\n    }\r\n    logger.trace(&quot;Exiting createFile method &quot;);\r\n    return trackerFile;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease check out this simple code snippet .. the file is created , deleted and then recreated . The file created at the end has a creation date which is the same as the first file that was deleted . How does this happen ?\r\n\r\n```java\r\npublic class CreateTempFile {\r\n\tpublic static void main(String[] args) {\r\n\t\ttry {\r\n\t\t\tFile file = new File(&quot;test.txt&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tfile.createNewFile();\r\n\t\t\tfile.delete();\r\n\t\t\tFile newFile = new File(&quot;test.txt&quot;);\r\n\t\t\tnewFile.createNewFile();\r\n\t\t} catch (IOException e) {\r\n\t\t\te.printStackTrace();\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58081009/files-getting-created-with-old-file-details-in-java","title":"Files getting

problem you have is when passing props\r\n\r\n    &lt;Item key=&quot;index&quot; superhero=&quot;{superhero}&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nYou should be passing it like \r\n\r\n    &lt;Item key={index} superhero={superhero} /&gt;\r\n\r\nIf you put is ass `someProp=&quot;something&quot;` you are just passing a string.\r\n\r\nIf you want to pass a variable, you need to pass it like `someProp={someVariable}`\r\n\r\nAnd the prop can be access inside `Item` like `this.props.someProp` (if it&#39;s a class component, or `props.someProp` if is a functional component, where `props` is the parameter of your functional component.\r\n\r\nEdit\r\n============\r\n\r\nOne mistake I just saw in your code is these two lines\r\n\r\n    const avengers = [&quot;Ironman&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Hawkeye&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;]\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n    import avengers from &quot;Main.js&quot;;\r\n\r\nIn the first line, you create `avangers` but you never `export` it, so you want be able to `import` it.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is add `export` and when importing, import it by the name (inside `{}`) because the way you are importing, you are getting the `default` export.\r\n\r\nSo here is how it should be \r\n\r\n    // added export\r\n    export const avengers = [&quot;Ironman&quot;, &quot;Thor&quot;, &quot;Hulk&quot;, &quot;Hawkeye&quot;, &quot;Black Widow&quot;]\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n    // importing avengers correctly\r\n    import Main, { avengers } from &quot;Main.js&quot;;\r\n\r\nEdit 2\r\n======\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is what you want, but I will guess\r\n\r\n    class Item extends React.Component {\r\n      render() {\r\n        return (\r\n              &lt;div&gt;\r\n                {this.props.superhero}\r\n              &lt;/div&gt;\r\n        );\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    export default Item;\r\n\r\n\r\nLast Edit\r\n======\r\n\r\nI made you a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/avengers-list-b0mk3) with a working example. Please take a look and see how it works, play around with it and try to learn from it.

When you do this it erases everything from the hierarchy window and then you only have that prefab visible until your done editing it, you click save and then its back to the original hierarchy that was there before you started editing.\r\n\r\nThis is all fine, but the problem is what if i want to drag a game object from my scene into the prefab im editing is now impossible because as soon as you start editing the prefab, it removes your scene and only shows the contents of the prefab. So you cant drag anything from your scene into the prefab any more because its gone for the duration of the editing.\r\n\r\nI dont know if im making myself clear or not.... But basically im saying while editing the prefab, only the contents of the prefab is visible, your scene is not visible, so you cant drag any object from your scene into the prefab anymore.\r\n\r\nAnybody knows how to get around this?

And your question has 2 questions.\r\n\r\n1. You want to know the reason that the created Google Document cannot be seen at your Google Drive.\r\n2. You want to know the reason that the permissions is required to be opening the created Document.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, how about this answer? Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\n## Issue:\r\nAs the main reason of your both questions, I think the use of the service account is the reason. The service account is different from your own Google account. So for example, when the file is created by the service account, the file is created in the Google Drive of the service account. By this, the file cannot be seen at your Google Drive. I think that this is the answer of your question 1. And, the file created in the Google Drive of the service account cannot be directly accessed because only the service account can access to it. I think that this is the answer of your question 2.\r\n\r\n## Solution:\r\nIn order to see the created Google Document on your Google Drive and make users view and edit the created Google Document, I would like to propose to add the permissions to the created Google Document using Permissions: create in Drive API. When this is reflected to your script, it becomes as follows.\r\n\r\n### Modified script:\r\nPlease modify your script as follows.\r\n\r\n#### From:\r\n\tdef file_to_drive(import_file=None):\r\n\t    credentials=service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\r\n\t    service = build(&#39;drive&#39;, &#39;v3&#39;, credentials=credentials)\r\n\t    file_metadata = {\r\n\t        &#39;name&#39;: &#39;My Report&#39;,\r\n\t        &#39;mimeType&#39;: &#39;application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet&#39;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    media = MediaFileUpload(import_file,\r\n\t                            mimetype=&#39;text/html&#39;,\r\n\t                            resumable=True)\r\n\t    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata,\r\n\t                                        media_body=media,\r\n\t                                        fields=&#39;id&#39;).execute()\r\n\t    print(&#39;File ID: %s&#39; % file.get(&#39;id&#39;))\r\n\t    return (f&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/{file.get(&#39;id&#39;)}/edit&quot;)\r\n\r\n#### To:\r\n\tdef file_to_drive(import_file=None):\r\n\t    credentials=service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\r\n\t    service = build(&#39;drive&#39;, &#39;v3&#39;, credentials=credentials)\r\n\t    file_metadata = {\r\n\t        &#39;name&#39;: &#39;My Report&#39;,\r\n\t        &#39;mimeType&#39;: &#39;application/vnd.google-apps.document&#39;  # Modified\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    media = MediaFileUpload(import_file,\r\n\t                            mimetype=&#39;text/html&#39;,\r\n\t                            resumable=True)\r\n\t    file = service.files().create(body=file_metadata,\r\n\t                                        media_body=media,\r\n\t                                        fields=&#39;id&#39;).execute()\r\n\t    fileId = file.get(&#39;id&#39;)  # Added\r\n\t    print(&#39;File ID: %s&#39; % fileId)\r\n\r\n\t    # --- I added below script.\r\n\t    permission1 = {\r\n\t        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;user&#39;,\r\n\t        &#39;role&#39;: &#39;writer&#39;,\r\n\t        &#39;emailAddress&#39;: &#39;###&#39;,  # Please set your email of Google account.\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    service.permissions().create(fileId=fileId, body=permission1).execute()\r\n\t    permission2 = {\r\n\t        &#39;type&#39;: &#39;anyone&#39;,\r\n\t        &#39;role&#39;: &#39;writer&#39;,\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    service.permissions().create(fileId=fileId, body=permission2).execute()\r\n\t    # ---\r\n\r\n\t    return (f&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/{file.get(&#39;id&#39;)}/edit&quot;)\r\n\r\n- In this modification, after the Google Document is created, the permissions are added to the created Document.\r\n\t- At `permission1`, your account is added as the writer. By this, you can see the created Document at your Google Drive. Please set your email of Google account here.\r\n\t- At `permission2`, in order to make users view and edit the created Document, the permission is added as `anyone` type. This is a test case. **If you want to add the user&#39;s emails as the permissions, please set them like `permission1`.**\r\n\r\n## Note:\r\n- When you want to create Google Document, please modify `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet` to `application/vnd.google-apps.document`. But in your case, when `text/html` is converted to `application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet`, it automatically converts to `application/vnd.google-apps.document`. Because `text/html` can be converted to only `application/vnd.google-apps.document`.\r\n\r\n## Reference:\r\n- [Permissions: create](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/permissions/create)\r\n\r\nIf I misunderstood your question and this was not the direction you want, I apologize.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080962/google-api-file-permissions-using-python/58088998#58088998","title":"Google API file permissions using python"}],"owner":{"reputation":407,"user_id":9262339,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/cec35b30ede09b37b048ddbff52a7469?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jekson","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9262339/jekson"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58088998,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569365056,"creation_date":1569330201,"question_id":58080962,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58080962","body_markdown":"I need to do some functionality for different users of my site  to automatically upload html files to google disk and open them for viewing and editing in google docs.

You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different from how it works in most languages. You have to remember to bind the event handlers. Without unstable syntax proposals, the code is very verbose. People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes. The distinction between function and class components in React and when to use each one leads to disagreements even between experienced React developers.\r\n\r\n&gt; Additionally, React has been out for about five years, and we want to make sure it stays relevant in the next five years. As Svelte, Angular, Glimmer, and others show, ahead-of-time compilation of components has a lot of future potential. Especially if it’s not limited to templates. Recently, we’ve been experimenting with component folding using Prepack, and we’ve seen promising early results. However, we found that class components can encourage unintentional patterns that make these optimizations fall back to a slower path. Classes present issues for today’s tools, too. For example, classes don’t minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable. We want to present an API that makes it more likely for code to stay on the optimizable path.\r\n \r\n&gt; To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes. Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#classes-confuse-both-people-and-machines","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080926/why-create-react-app-changed-app-js-component-to-function-based-component/58081101#58081101","title":"Why create-react-app changed App.js component to function based component?"}],"owner":{"reputation":319,"user_id":4191437,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/odRyD.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"behzad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4191437/behzad"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569331542,"creation_date":1569330089,"question_id":58080926,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58080926","body_markdown":"As I noticed, it seems `create-react-app` changed `app.js` class component based in a function component, \n\nany idea why they did this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080926/why-create-react-app-changed-app-js-component-to-function-based-component","title":"Why create-react-app changed App.js component to function based component?"},{"tags":["javascript","html","angular","angular-material"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":133,"user_id":10557332,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rLFO.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Job","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10557332/job"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569332156,"post_id":58080925,"comment_id":102557454,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080925/material-select-menu-with-checkbox#comment102557454_58080925"},{"owner":{"reputation":124,"user_id":8284340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9Zuwu.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ALGDB","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8284340/algdb"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569336618,"post_id":58080925,"comment_id":102560034,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080925/material-select-menu-with-checkbox#comment102560034_58080925"},{"owner":{"reputation":57,"user_id":12113249,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2rKNvBNO4TI/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3remIqQ-O5p3xp4rm-rjEhVhZxv8nw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"S&#233;bastian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12113249/s%c3%a9bastian"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569338186,"post_id":58080925,"comment_id":102560915,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080925/material-select-menu-with-checkbox#comment102560915_58080925"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":8080,"user_id":9226213,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d9b1e59fd7fb8bc106b44b337ce5d83?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"G.

First, you need to locate the DOM node using client side JavaScript. ZK offers the function `window.jq()` for that. This function gives you access to a jQuery instance (see https://www.zkoss.org/wiki/ZK_Client-side_Reference/General_Control/Client-side_selection_of_elements_and_widgets). \r\n\r\nTo differentiate between DOM and ZK IDs, use `#` and `$` respectively.\r\n\r\nSo the final JavaScript should look like so:\r\n\r\n    jq(&#39;$foo&#39;)\r\n\r\nTo run this JavaScript, use `driver.executeScript()`. You probably also want to use a context (development IDs are often only unique within a ZK parent element).\r\n\r\nThe result is a jQuery set which for example ChromeDriver can&#39;t handle (you will get `javascript error: circular reference` errors). So you need to call `toArray()` on the result to convert the jQuery object into an array with plain DOM nodes. ChromeDriver knows how to convert those to Java. All that is left is to return this array from JavaScript. You will then get a `List&lt;WebElement&gt;` on the Java side.\r\n\r\nI have created a `By` locator for this:\r\n\r\n    public class ByZKId extends By {\r\n\r\n        private String id;\r\n        private WebElement context;\r\n\r\n        public ByZKId(String id) {\r\n            this.id = &quot;$&quot; + id;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        public ByZKId(String id, WebElement context) {\r\n            this.id = &quot;$&quot; + id;\r\n            this.context = context;\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        @Override\r\n        public List&lt;WebElement&gt; findElements(SearchContext context) {\r\n            if (context == null) {\r\n                return executeJavaScript(&quot;return jq(arguments[0]).toArray();&quot;, id);\r\n            }\r\n            \r\n            return executeJavaScript(&quot;return jq(arguments[0], arguments[1]).toArray();&quot;, id, this.context);\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        @Override\r\n        public String toString() {\r\n            return &quot;ByZKId: [&quot; + id + &quot;]&quot;;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080921/how-do-i-locate-zk-dom-nodes-with-selenium-3/58080966#58080966","title":"How do I locate ZK DOM nodes with Selenium 3?"}],"owner":{"reputation":258589,"user_id":34088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a4d6f03a8879432d8563aefbf48e787?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aaron Digulla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34088/aaron-digulla"},"last_editor":{"reputation":258589,"user_id":34088,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a4d6f03a8879432d8563aefbf48e787?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Aaron Digulla","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/34088/aaron-digulla"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569330609,"creation_date":1569330067,"last_edit_date":1569330609,"question_id":58080921,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58080921","body_markdown":"When using ZK, I have development IDs (`id=&quot;foo&quot;`).

How could I create a custom attribute, similar to Authorize, to achieve the same behavior (something like LocalOnly) for WebAPI methods?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I have in the Configure method in Startup.cs:\r\n\r\n     app.Use(async (context, next) =&gt;\r\n            {\r\n                var ip = context.Connection.RemoteIpAddress.ToString();\r\n                var isInternal = Regex.IsMatch(ip, @&quot;(^127\\.)|(^(0)?10\\.)|(^172\\.(0)?1[6-9]\\.)|(^172\\.(0)?2[0-9]\\.)|(^172\\.(0)?3[0-1]\\.)|(^169\\.254\\.)|(^192\\.168\\.)&quot;);\r\n                if (!isInternal &amp;&amp; !context.User.Identity.IsAuthenticated) {\r\n                    context.Response.StatusCode = 401;\r\n                } else\r\n                {\r\n                    await next();\r\n                }\r\n            });","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080918/middleware-to-require-authentication-for-local-ip-net-core","title":"Middleware to Require Authentication for Local IP .Net Core"},{"tags":["docker"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":6631759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dT5GxkCbQN0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/GPptky9YuUc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christian M&#252;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6631759/christian-m%c3%bcller"},"edited":false,"score":3,"creation_date":1569330394,"post_id":58080910,"comment_id":102556255,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080910/docker-get-a-list-of-files-installed-in-image#comment102556255_58080910"},{"owner":{"reputation":2124,"user_id":474221,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CkXrx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"basti","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/474221/basti"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569333293,"post_id":58080910,"comment_id":102558088,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080910/docker-get-a-list-of-files-installed-in-image#comment102558088_58080910"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":514,"user_id":6631759,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dT5GxkCbQN0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZ8/GPptky9YuUc/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Christian M&#252;ller","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6631759/christian-m%c3%bcller"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569330486,"creation_date":1569330486,"answer_id":58081052,"question_id":58080910,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58081052","body_markdown":"I assume you will finde the answer with: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44769315/how-to-see-docker-image-contents/44769468\r\n\r\ndocker image history --no-trunc image_name &gt; image_history\r\n\r\nShould give you the history.

SIGABRT is a pretty general exception that can happen in a lot of ways, but usually relates to an invalid pointer or reading/writing memory that you&#39;re not supposed to be using.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/2zpDa.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080904/i-programme-my-app-before-last-version-of-swift-and-now-i-am-trying-to-run-my-ap/58080946#58080946","title":"I programme my app before last version of swift and now I am trying to run my app and I have this error"}],"owner":{"reputation":21,"user_id":12113205,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCdxAv_b9gALHuoO4FwOdCznwafkbQNS8AJOMzZ=k-s128","display_name":"jeena azeez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12113205/jeena-azeez"},"last_editor":{"reputation":113459,"user_id":643383,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/uQ5JF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Caleb","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/643383/caleb"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":10,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1569338654,"accepted_answer_id":58080946,"answer_count":1,"score":-9,"last_activity_date":1569330798,"creation_date":1569330017,"last_edit_date":1569330798,"question_id":58080904,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58080904","body_markdown":"&quot;Editor placeholder in source file&quot;\r\n\r\n![Editor placeholder in source file][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nwhen I remove this function from my coding I have anther error that said &quot;Thread 1: signal SIGABRT&quot;\r\n[signal sigabrt][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xSJ0M.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/5oY41.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080904/i-programme-my-app-before-last-version-of-swift-and-now-i-am-trying-to-run-my-ap","closed_reason":"off-topic","title":"I programme my app before last version of swift and now I am trying to run my app and I have this error"},{"tags":["c#","xaml","uwp","win-universal-app"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":337,"user_id":7412111,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-XdUIqdMkCWA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/4252rscbv5M/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Seaky Lone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7412111/seaky-lone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569375192,"post_id":58081341,"comment_id":102573046,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080902/uwp-inherit-from-control/58081341#comment102573046_58081341"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":12067560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YrPJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Corentin Pane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067560/corentin-pane"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1412,"user_id":12067560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1YrPJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Corentin Pane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12067560/corentin-pane"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569414538,"last_edit_date":1569414538,"creation_date":1569331414,"answer_id":58081341,"question_id":58080902,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58081341","body_markdown":"If you want your control to &quot;be treated as a normal ```TextBlock```&quot;, then you don&#39;t have any other choice than inheriting from ```TextBlock```.

Values can be set at various levels and the closest explicit setting wins. This is why a shape-level setting is reliable, because it is the &quot;closest&quot; possible setting.\r\n\r\nIn the case of placeholders, like the title placeholder in your example, the cascade goes:\r\n\r\n1. The placeholder shape itself (`slide.placeholders[0]` or more simply `slide.title`)\r\n2. The _slide layout_ placeholder this derives from\r\n3. The _slide master_ placeholder the layout placeholder derives from\r\n4. Probably some global default when not specified in the slide master title placeholder\r\n\r\nSo to derive the _effective_ font-size value you need to traverse this &quot;inheritance chain&quot; until you find an explicitly-defined value, which will be the effective value. Something like the following pseudo-code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef effective_title_placeholder_font_size():\r\n    if title_placeholder.font-size is not None:\r\n        return title_placeholder.font-size\r\n    if slide-layout-title-placeholder.font-size is not None:\r\n        return slide-layout-title-placeholder.font-size\r\n    etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe process is further complicated by the fact font-size can be set on the overall shape, or can be overridden on an individual paragraph or run. This is the difference between selecting the overall shape and setting font size and selecting a range of text and setting the font size.\r\n\r\nSo you see something of the complexities involved. It&#39;s definitely doable, but you&#39;re going to need to want it pretty bad, depending on your Python and general software-development skill level.\r\n\r\nAt best, there is only partial API support for these various operations in `python-pptx` (like get the slide-layout counterpart of this slide placeholder, etc.), so you&#39;re likely to need to dig into the XML a fair amount.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58080872/can-i-get-the-default-font-size-of-a-placeholder-with-python-pptx/58089752#58089752","title":"Can I get the default font size of a placeholder with python-pptx?"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":870458,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c46b5ccdf07a2e9d5b6c49dd31e6620?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870458/jens"},"last_editor":{"reputation":36,"user_id":870458,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6c46b5ccdf07a2e9d5b6c49dd31e6620?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jens","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/870458/jens"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569372386,"creation_date":1569329908,"last_edit_date":1569356288,"question_id":58080872,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58080872","body_markdown":"I&#39;m creating a Powerpoint presentation with the [python-pptx package](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). \r\n\r\nI know I can [set the font size](https://python-pptx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/text.html#applying-character-formatting) of a paragraph or a run.

I&#39;m not using Python3&#39;s asyncio methods anywhere.\r\n\r\nHowever, when converting my app from Python 2.7 (it works perfectly in Python2) to Python 3.7, I&#39;m having problems with tornado/ asyncio.\r\n\r\nFirst, I was getting the error: `RuntimeError: There is no current event loop in thread &#39;Thread-26&#39;`.\r\n\r\nAfter some googling, I found a recomendation to mitigate this:\r\n\r\n    import tornado.platform.asyncio\r\n    import asyncio\r\n    asyncio.set_event_loop_policy(tornado.platform.asyncio.AnyThreadEventLoopPolicy())\r\n\r\nThis appears to solve that error.
