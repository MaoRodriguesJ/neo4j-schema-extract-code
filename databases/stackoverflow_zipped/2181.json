After you connect to the first peripheral, you pop the current View Controller from the Navigation Controller. By doing so, your peripherals array would be released since the Controller is no longer available. Therefore, there is no reference to current discovered peripherals. When there is no reference to a peripheral, it will be disconnected. (Think of closing an app that is connected to a peripheral will force a disconnection).\r\n\r\n### Solution: ###\r\nInstead of setting the parentView as peripheral delegate, set self (`ScanTableViewController`) as delegate and do not pop the Controller. In other words, do something that will keep the reference.  \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021941/connecting-and-writing-to-multiple-peripherals-with-one-cbmanager/58023760#58023760","title":"Connecting and writing to multiple peripherals with one CBManager"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087406,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA2k7SA3C6JYy4ebdP8q11Qe6SkzzPCqm7j1JRFog=k-s128","display_name":"Bo Heyse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087406/bo-heyse"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12087406,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mA2k7SA3C6JYy4ebdP8q11Qe6SkzzPCqm7j1JRFog=k-s128","display_name":"Bo Heyse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12087406/bo-heyse"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569035127,"creation_date":1568954933,"last_edit_date":1569035127,"question_id":58021941,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021941","body_markdown":"I am trying to make an iOS application that uses the CoreBluetooth library to start/stop and transfer the data from multiple inertial measurement units that are equipped with HM-10 BLE 4.0 modules.

Now this is where i&#39;m running into problems,the two remote lans can access eachother, if i connect my phone via openvpn connect, i can access all services.

No need to join the department table.)\r\n\r\n**Outer join:**\r\n\r\n    select d.dept_name, coalesce(i.instructors, 0) as num_instructors\r\n    from department d\r\n    left outer join\r\n    (\r\n      select dept_name, count(*) as instructors\r\n      from instructor\r\n      group by dept_name\r\n    ) i on i.dept_name = d.dept_name;\r\n\r\nAs you see, we must deal with the possibility that the subquery returns no row for a department, so we must turn the resulting null count into a zero.\r\n\r\nUsing a `WITH` clause merely means moving a subquery from the `FROM` clause to the beginning of the query, either for readability or in order to use it more than once in the query:\r\n\r\n    with i as\r\n    (\r\n      select dept_name, count(*) as instructors\r\n      from instructor\r\n      group by dept_name\r\n    )\r\n    select d.dept_name, coalesce(i.instructors, 0) as num_instructors\r\n    from department d\r\n    left outer join i on i.dept_name = d.dept_name;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021909/where-am-i-going-wrong-in-this-modification-for-this-sql-code/58022062#58022062","title":"Where am I going wrong in this modification for this Sql code?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":55805,"user_id":2270762,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52b46f7eff0a47c420a9a6f56a40fd0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thorsten Kettner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2270762/thorsten-kettner"},"last_editor":{"reputation":55805,"user_id":2270762,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/52b46f7eff0a47c420a9a6f56a40fd0b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thorsten Kettner","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2270762/thorsten-kettner"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568980821,"last_edit_date":1568980821,"creation_date":1568959490,"answer_id":58022602,"question_id":58021909,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022602","body_markdown":"I am adding this to explain what&#39;s wrong with your own query.\r\n\r\nFirst of all\r\n\r\n    from department, instructor \r\n    where department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name\r\n\r\nis the ancient syntax for\r\n\r\n    from department\r\n    inner join instructor on department.dept_name = instructor.dept_name\r\n\r\n(You are combining each instructor row with its department row here.)\r\n\r\nAnd this alone\r\n\r\n    from dept, dept_count\r\n\r\nis the ancient syntax for\r\n\r\n    from dept\r\n    cross join dept_count\r\n\r\n(You are creating all possible combinations of departments and department counts here.

In order to allow `main` to access the member variables directly, you&#39;ll have to make the member variables `public`.

user input and execute the next command is there any way how to resolve it thanks in advance.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do is:\r\n \r\n1) python code to ssh my server.\r\n\r\n2) source this demo-openrc.sh file after this file source successfully\r\n\r\n3) I execute my next cmds like an OpenStack server list.\r\n\r\n    from _multiprocessing import send\r\n\r\n    import paramiko\r\n

should consider using [S3 Pre-signed URL][1]\r\n\r\nSo instead of using your instance as middleman for the transaction, create an API which allow the client to retrieve **a short-lived unique (s3

I believe this is more scalable than your existing solutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, there&#39;s a caveat. Your pre-signed url (as the name suggested) is &quot;pre-authenticated&quot;, be careful on serving this information to your client, and ensure the url is shortlived enough to prevent further abuse.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might need additional implementation of listening to S3 event if you want to get notified when files are uploaded successfully to the storage.

Here I use https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-paths-given-source-destination/\r\n\r\n    # https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-paths-given-source-destination/\r\n    from collections import defaultdict \r\n    \r\n    #This class represents a directed graph  (from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-paths-given-source-destination/)\r\n    # using adjacency list representation \r\n    class Graph: \r\n       \r\n        def __init__(self,vertices): \r\n            #No. of vertices \r\n            self.V= vertices  \r\n              \r\n            # default dictionary to store graph \r\n            self.graph = defaultdict(list)  \r\n       \r\n        # function to add an edge to graph \r\n        def addEdge(self,u,v): \r\n            self.graph[u].append(v) \r\n       \r\n        &#39;&#39;&#39;A recursive function to print all paths from &#39;u&#39; to &#39;d&#39;. \r\n        visited[] keeps track of vertices in current path. \r\n        path[] stores actual vertices and path_index is current \r\n        index in path[]&#39;&#39;&#39;\r\n        def findAllPathsUtil(self, u, d, visited, path, results = set()): \r\n            \r\n            # Mark the current node as visited and store in path \r\n            visited[u]= True\r\n            path.append(u) \r\n      \r\n            # If current vertex is same as destination, then print \r\n            # current path[] \r\n            if u ==d: \r\n                results.add (tuple(path))\r\n            else: \r\n                # If current vertex is not destination \r\n                #Recur for all the vertices adjacent to this vertex \r\n                for i in self.graph[u]: \r\n                    if visited[i]==False: \r\n                        self.findAllPathsUtil(i, d, visited, path, results) \r\n                          \r\n            # Remove current vertex from path[] and mark it as unvisited \r\n            path.pop() \r\n            visited[u]= False\r\n       \r\n        # Prints all paths from &#39;s&#39; to &#39;d&#39; \r\n        def findAllPaths(self,s, d, results = set()): \r\n      \r\n            # Mark all the vertices as not visited \r\n            visited = defaultdict(lambda: False) # [False]*(self.V) \r\n      \r\n            # Create an array to store paths \r\n            path = [] \r\n      \r\n            # Call the recursive helper function to print all paths \r\n            return self.findAllPathsUtil(s, d,visited, path, results)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nThe above is basic code to create a directed graph and to print all paths between nodes.  \r\n\r\nIt was modified slightly to allow nodes to be numbered from 1 rather than 0 to match the numbering of tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe use it to:\r\n\r\n 1.

However, I am not sure how ensure that each newly duplicated list takes in the different successor and how to run each list iteratively once again.\r\n\r\nThe following code is my current attempt:\r\n```\r\n&gt; Initial = []; Task_Chain = [] \r\n&gt; for i in range(1,26):\r\n&gt;     create = 0\r\n&gt;     for k in Precedence:\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;         if i != k[1]:\r\n&gt;             create += 1\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;     if create == len(Precedence):\r\n&gt;         Initial.append([i])\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; cont = True \r\n&gt; while cont == True:\r\n&gt;     count = 0\r\n&gt;     successors = []\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     for i in Initial:\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         for k in Precedence:\r\n&gt;             if i[-1] == k[0]:\r\n&gt;                 count += 1\r\n&gt;                 successors.append(k[1])\r\n&gt;             \r\n&gt;         if count == 1:\r\n&gt;             i.append(successors[0])\r\n&gt;         \r\n&gt;         else:\r\n&gt;             for num in range(1,count):\r\n&gt;                 Initial.append(i)\r\n&gt; ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought I would run the while loop until all task chains are completed and implement &#39;cont = false&#39;.\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated, thank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021871/forming-a-task-chain-with-immediate-precedence","title":"Forming a Task Chain with immediate precedence"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":459,"user_id":10276616,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TVVaMlwiD48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFM/XK2zMUoD6p0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"CHARITRA SHRESTHA","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10276616/charitra-shrestha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568954814,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446651,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446651_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":3148642,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42349287c864fce33cc7ca059ff901c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Casper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3148642/casper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568954937,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446678,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446678_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":3148642,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42349287c864fce33cc7ca059ff901c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Casper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3148642/casper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568955207,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446742,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446742_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":10357871,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1836485426472755/picture?type=large","display_name":"Prince Kumar Dwivedi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10357871/prince-kumar-dwivedi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568955292,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446762,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446762_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":3148642,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/42349287c864fce33cc7ca059ff901c4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Casper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3148642/casper"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568955294,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446764,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446764_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12040805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c6e2482271e1a5cb3f916ec518cfb36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ifte Kharul Islam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12040805/ifte-kharul-islam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568955302,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446768,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446768_58021869"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12040805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9c6e2482271e1a5cb3f916ec518cfb36?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ifte Kharul Islam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12040805/ifte-kharul-islam"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568955710,"post_id":58021869,"comment_id":102446846,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021869/not-getting-image-full-path-after-updating-the-post-in-laravel-5-8#comment102446846_58021869"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":417,"user_id":9243056,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/SIzhl.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"sandy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9243056/sandy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568955532,"creation_date":1568955532,"answer_id":58022017,"question_id":58021869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58022017","body_markdown":"while you store the image you have append path with image name see below code \r\n\r\n    $post = Post::create([\r\n                &#39;title&#39;

Which I have done below:\r\n\r\n```kotlin  \r\n        val uniqueColors = colors.toHashSet()\r\n        val colorTexCoordsMap = HashMap&lt;Color, FloatArray&gt;()\r\n\r\n        val atlas = WritableImage(uniqueColors.size, 1)\r\n\r\n        for((index, color) in uniqueColors.withIndex()) {\r\n            colorTexCoordsMap[color] = floatArrayOf(index.toDouble().div(uniqueColors.size).toFloat(), 0.5f)\r\n            atlas.pixelWriter.setColor(index, 0, color)\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        atlasMaterialProperty.set(PhongMaterial().also {\r\n            it.diffuseMap = atlas\r\n        })\r\n\r\n        val out = File(&quot;model-${definition.id}-${uniqueColors.size}-atlas.png&quot;)\r\n        val bim = SwingFXUtils.fromFXImage(atlas, null)\r\n        ImageIO.write(bim, &quot;png&quot;, out)\r\n        \r\n        for(face in 0 until definition.faceCount){\r\n            val color = colors[face]\r\n            val uv = colorTexCoordsMap[color]!!\r\n            val vertex1 = definition.faceVertexIndices1[face]\r\n            val vertex2 = definition.faceVertexIndices2[face]\r\n            val vertex3 = definition.faceVertexIndices3[face]\r\n            val vx1 = definition.vertexPositionsX[vertex1]\r\n            val vy1 = definition.vertexPositionsY[vertex1]\r\n            val vz1 = definition.vertexPositionsZ[vertex1]\r\n            val vx2 = definition.vertexPositionsX[vertex2]\r\n            val vy2 = definition.vertexPositionsY[vertex2]\r\n            val vz2 = definition.vertexPositionsZ[vertex2]\r\n            val vx3 = definition.vertexPositionsX[vertex3]\r\n            val vy3 = definition.vertexPositionsY[vertex3]\r\n            val vz3 = definition.vertexPositionsZ[vertex3]\r\n            val vertex1Index = cacheVertex(vertex1, vx1, vy1, vz1)\r\n            val vertex2Index = cacheVertex(vertex2, vx2, vy2, vz2)\r\n            val vertex3Index = cacheVertex(vertex3, vx3, vy3, vz3)\r\n            val texIndex = cacheUV(uv[0], uv[1])\r\n\r\n            faces.addAll(\r\n                vertex1Index, texIndex,\r\n                vertex2Index, texIndex,\r\n                vertex3Index, texIndex\r\n            )\r\n            faceSmoothingGroups.addAll(0)\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected the colors would be displayed accurately, however they are not. I am thinking this has to do with the division part not being very accurate and therefore in models that use many colors sometimes the uv coordinate no longer maps to the intended color in the generated image. \r\n\r\nIn the current code an image of height=1 and width=color_count is generated. So each x value represents the index of the color.

that simple but here is how you can achieve something similar. **This requires your 3D models to be correctly UV mapped so you can simply apply a flat texture to it.** The setup may sound complex but it is really cool ;)\r\n\r\n1. Create a [`RenderTexture`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/RenderTexture.html): In the `Asset` do &lt;kbd&gt;right mouse click&lt;/kbd&gt; &amp;rightarrow; `Create` &amp;rightarrow; `RenderTexture` and call it however you like e.g. `TextTexture`\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n - To have a better resolution later increase it&#39;s `size` to e.g. `2048*2048` depedning on your needs of course.\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n2. Create a new Material \r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n - using the just created `RenderTexture` as `Albedo` \r\n - and set the `RenderingMode` to `Fade` (in order to later have it&#39;s background transparent)\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][4]][4]\r\n\r\n3. Create a new [Layer](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Layers.html) and call it e.g. `TEXT`\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][5]][5]\r\n [![enter image description here][6]][6]\r\n\r\n4. In you normal main `Camera` under `Culling Mask` **exclude** the just created `TEXT` layer. So it will not render our Text content\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][7]][7]\r\n\r\n5. Add a new `Camera` to your scene (it will only render the text) and call it e.g. `TextCamera` \r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][8]][8]\r\n\r\n and make the following settings:\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][9]][9]\r\n\r\n - Remove its `AudioListener` component\r\n - `Clear Flags` &amp;rightarrow; `Solid Color`\r\n - `Background` &amp;rightarrow; Color actually doesn&#39;t matter but make sure to set the Alpha level to `0`!\r\n - `Culling Mask` &amp;rightarrow; Nothing except the created `TEXT` layer\r\n - `Target Texture` &amp;rightarrow; The created `RenderTexture`\r\n\r\n Now you already have a Material with a dynamically changeable Texture with transparent background and whatever content you like. So lets make it e.g. a UI.Text\r\n\r\n6. To your scene (I did it simply as child of the `TextCamera` so I can simply move it out of sight in the SceneView while working on other stuff) add a `Text` (including the Canvas etc - Unity usually adds it automatically)\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][10]][10]\r\n\r\n - Make all GameObjects (Canvas and Text) have the Layer `TEXT` so they will not be rendered by the normal `Camera` but only by the `TextCamera`.\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][11]][11]\r\n [![enter image description here][12]][12]\r\n\r\n - Make sure the `Canvas` uses `RenderMode = WorldSpace` (it won&#39;t work with overlay canvas)!\r\n - Place the `Canvas` about e.g. `3` units in front of the `TextCamera` (or wherever you like so the Text is visible in the texture later)\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][13]][13]\r\n\r\n - To have better Text resolution I would also on the `Text`\r\n  - on the `RectTransform` set `width = 1000`, `height = 1000`, `Scale = 0.001, 0.001, 0.001`\r\n  - In the `Text` component set `Font Size = 300`\r\n  - Just to be sure disable the `Raycast Target` option\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][14]][14]\r\n\r\nAnd now you can simply apply the created material to your 3D Object and hit play and should see that it gets completely transparent except having the text on it.\r\n\r\n [![enter image description here][15]][15]\r\n\r\nSo in order to use it as overlay for a 3D object you could e.g. simply duplicate the original object, call one e.g. `Inner` the other one `Outer` and make `Inner` a child of `Outer`. Now on the `Outer` you set our Text material. This works since a material using `Fade` as render mode is rendered on a different render chain which is rendered on top of the default one. \r\n\r\n&amp;rightarrow; Tadaaa 3D object with Text applied to its surface and can even dynamically change the text and its properties like color etc\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][16]][16]\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### The whole thing dynamic (Except creating Layers)\r\n\r\nSince you asked: Yes you *can* make this all in a script ... **except creating new Layers! This is not possible on runtime!**\r\n\r\nSo you have to know all the Layers you will use beforehand then you can do something like\r\n\r\n    [RequireComponent(typeof(MeshRenderer), typeof(MeshFilter))]\r\n    public class TextOnObjectManager : MonoBehaviour\r\n    {\r\n        // reference via Inspector if possible\r\n        [SerializeField] private Camera mainCamera;\r\n        [SerializeField] private string LayerToUse;\r\n    \r\n        private void Awake()\r\n        {\r\n            // 0. make the clone of this and make it a child\r\n            var innerObject = new GameObject(name + &quot;_original&quot;, typeof(MeshRenderer)).AddComponent&lt;MeshFilter&gt;();\r\n            innerObject.transform.SetParent(transform);\r\n            // copy over the mesh\r\n            innerObject.mesh = GetComponent&lt;MeshFilter&gt;().mesh;\r\n            name = name + &quot;_textDecal&quot;;\r\n    \r\n            // 1.

This way you can have Selenium start an instance of a browser, scrape the page for whatever elements you want, then download whatever images or write whatever text you want to files. \r\n\r\nEither that or look into using the [&#39;curl&#39; command](https://linuxhint.com/curl_bash_examples/). \r\n\r\nSince Javascript is used for a lot of malicious web crawling odds are you&#39;re going to have a bad time trying to get something to work with javascript without any kind of ajax or api.

When I created a basic_pipe and inherit handles, at least it worked fine. But if I create an async_pipe and inherit handles, it gives me an error of value 87 (Invalid parameter).

your comments, the following query is in fact quite performant:\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM accounts\r\n    ORDER BY id\r\n    LIMIT 1;\r\n\r\nThe reason this performs well is that the `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` step is the only thing which Postgres needs to do before `SELECT`, and the `accounts_pkey` unique index can easily be scanned here.  Actually, Postgres only needs to find the lowest `id` value, and then refer back to the clustered index to cover the `SELECT *`.\r\n\r\nHowever, the query in your question is a bit different:\r\n\r\n    SELECT *\r\n    FROM accounts\r\n    WHERE pid = &#39;hd&#39; AND fid = &#39;123&#39;\r\n    ORDER BY id ASC\r\n    LIMIT 1;\r\n\r\nIn this case, Postgres is choosing to scan the entire `accounts_pkey` index, starting with a filter step corresponding to your `WHERE` clause.  Because `accounts_pkey` only covers the `id` column, Postgres must seek back to the clustered index to lookup the value of `pid` and `fid`.  Ideally, Postgres would just start with the lowest `id` value and walk down the index until finding the first match on the `pid` and `fid` values.  Regardless of what Postgres is deciding to do, the following covering index could help here:\r\n\r\n    CREATE INDEX idx_accounts_cover ON public.accounts USING btree (pid, fid, id);\r\n\r\nGiven that nearly 6 million records could now easily be removed using the above index, the remaining `LIMIT`/`ORDER BY` operation on `id` might be more tolerable.  And since this index also covers `id`, Postgres only would have to a seek back to clustered index once, at the very end of the query.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021771/postgresql-slow-query-with-limit-1-and-order-by-unneeded-where-condition/58022208#58022208","title":"PostgreSQL slow query with limit 1 and order by unneeded where condition"}],"owner":{"reputation":25872,"user_id":3011380,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oN76M.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"zangw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3011380/zangw"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":42,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568956915,"creation_date":1568953652,"question_id":58021771,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021771","body_markdown":"I have one table `accounts` and indexes\r\n\r\n```sql\r\naccounts {\r\n\tid\ttext\r\n\tnum_id\tbigint\r\n\tpid\ttext\r\n\tfid\ttext\r\n\tcreated_at\ttimestamp with time zone\r\n\tupdated_at\ttimestamp with time zone\r\n}\r\n\r\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX accounts_pkey ON public.accounts USING btree (id)\r\nCREATE INDEX fid_idx ON public.accounts USING btree (fid)\r\nCREATE INDEX idx_accounts_pid_fid ON public.accounts USING btree (pid, fid)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this query is slow\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nexplain analyse SELECT * FROM accounts\r\nWHERE pid = &#39;hd&#39;

These `Places` are beginning and finishing in random fashion. For each time period, I want to assign each unique place to a `Group`. The central rules in doing this are:\r\n\r\n1) Each `Group` can hold no more than 3 unique `Places` **at any one time**\r\n\r\n2) Unique `Places` should be evenly distributed across each `Group` \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve taken a very small subsection of the `df`. There are 7 unique values (but no more than 5 occuring at any one time) and 2 `Groups` to choose from. But in practice, the `df` could contain up to 50 unique values in total that finish and end and varying time periods that will be distributed across a maximum of 6 Groups.\r\n\r\nTo understand how many `Places` are currently occuring I&#39;ve included a `Total`, which is based on if the `Place` appears again.\r\n\r\nThe `df` contains all available `Groups` for each unique `Place` at each `Period`. Places `Golf` and `Club` will finish but we assume all other places are continued as they appear later in the `df`. \r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\r\n        &#39;Period&#39; : [1,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5,5,6,6],  \r\n        &#39;Place&#39; : [&#39;CLUB&#39;,&#39;CLUB&#39;,&#39;CLUB&#39;,&#39;HOME&#39;,&#39;HOME&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;WORK&#39;,&#39;WORK&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;GOLF&#39;,&#39;GOLF&#39;,&#39;CLUB&#39;,&#39;CLUB&#39;,&#39;POOL&#39;,&#39;POOL&#39;,&#39;HOME&#39;,&#39;HOME&#39;,&#39;WORK&#39;,&#39;WORK&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;AWAY&#39;,&#39;POOL&#39;,&#39;POOL&#39;,&#39;TENNIS&#39;,&#39;TENNIS&#39;],                                \r\n        &#39;Total&#39; : [1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,5,5],                            \r\n        &#39;Available Group&#39; : [&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;1&#39;],                           \r\n        })\r\n\r\nThe main issue that&#39;s causing me trouble is `Places` appear/exist dynamically. In that, they finish and new ones begin in a random fashion. So assigning and distributing the **current** unique `Places` needs to account for this concept\r\n\r\nAttempt:\r\n\r\n    def AssignPlace(df):\r\n            uniquePlaces = df[&#39;Place&#39;].unique()\r\n            G3 = dict(zip(uniquePlaces, np.arange(len(uniquePlaces)) // 3 + 1))\r\n            df[&#39;Assigned Group&#39;] = df[&#39;Place&#39;].map(G3)\r\n            return df\r\n\r\n    df = df.groupby(&#39;Available Group&#39;, sort=False).apply(AssignPlace)\r\n    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset = [&#39;Period&#39;,&#39;Place&#39;])\r\n\r\nOut:\r\n \r\n        Period   Place  Total Available Group  Assigned Group\r\n    0   1       CLUB    1      1               1             \r\n    1   2       CLUB    1      2               1             \r\n    3   2       HOME    2      2               1             \r\n    5   2       AWAY    3      2               1             \r\n    7   3       WORK    4      2               2             \r\n    9   3       AWAY    4      1               1             \r\n    11  3       GOLF    5      1               2  #GOLF FINISHES SO 4 OCCURING FROM NEXT ROW            \r\n    13  4       CLUB    4      2               1  #CLUB FINISHES BUT POOL STARTS SO STILL 4 OCCURING FROM NEXT ROW           \r\n    15  4       POOL    4      2               2             \r\n    17  4       HOME    4      2               1             \r\n    19  5       WORK    4      2               2             \r\n    21  5       AWAY    4      1               1             \r\n    23  5       POOL    4      1               2             \r\n    25  6       TENNIS  5      2               3  #Signifies issue\r\n\r\nThe last row displays the start of the issue. The assigned group measures this place correctly as the 7th unique value but it doesn&#39;t account for _current_ unique values.

So each new unique value will continue to be counted, rather than account for currently occuring unique values.\r\n\r\nIntended Output, `TENNIS` Assigned Group is now `1`, instead of `3`:\r\n\r\n        Period   Place  Total Available Group  Assigned Group\r\n    0   1       CLUB    1      1               1             \r\n    1   2       CLUB    1      2               1             \r\n    3   2       HOME    2      2               1             \r\n    5   2       AWAY    3      2               1             \r\n    7   3       WORK    4      2               2             \r\n    9   3       AWAY    4      1               1             \r\n    11  3       GOLF    5      1               2             \r\n    13  4       CLUB    4      2               1             \r\n    15  4       POOL    4      2               2             \r\n    17  4       HOME    4      2               1             \r\n    19  5       WORK    4      2               2             \r\n    21  5       AWAY    4      1               1             \r\n    23  5       POOL    4      1               2             \r\n    25  6       TENNIS  5      2               1 ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021749/allocate-values-from-different-options-pandas","title":"Allocate values from different options - pandas"},{"tags":["python","ffmpeg","ffprobe","timecodes"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568956780,"post_id":58021748,"comment_id":102447101,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021748/how-to-read-the-timecode-from-a-dpx-file-via-python#comment102447101_58021748"},{"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":8940798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1992f96d13f900a36320efc9b473c55c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike McReynolds","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940798/mike-mcreynolds"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568994833,"post_id":58021748,"comment_id":102465693,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021748/how-to-read-the-timecode-from-a-dpx-file-via-python#comment102465693_58021748"},{"owner":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569001356,"post_id":58021748,"comment_id":102468096,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021748/how-to-read-the-timecode-from-a-dpx-file-via-python#comment102468096_58021748"},{"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":8940798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1992f96d13f900a36320efc9b473c55c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike McReynolds","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940798/mike-mcreynolds"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":40256,"user_id":5726027,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a15e6b3536ef969cf3a9828a0542aac2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5726027/gyan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570229330,"post_id":58021748,"comment_id":102859943,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58021748/how-to-read-the-timecode-from-a-dpx-file-via-python#comment102859943_58021748"}],"owner":{"reputation":75,"user_id":8940798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1992f96d13f900a36320efc9b473c55c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike McReynolds","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940798/mike-mcreynolds"},"last_editor":{"reputation":75,"user_id":8940798,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1992f96d13f900a36320efc9b473c55c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mike McReynolds","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8940798/mike-mcreynolds"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568995032,"creation_date":1568953475,"last_edit_date":1568995032,"question_id":58021748,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58021748","body_markdown":"As part of a larger script, I need to be able to read the timecode off of a DPX file.

I don&#39;t know what language you&#39;re using, but you should consider something more like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhile row &lt;= 3:\r\n  while col &lt;= 3:\r\n    print (row, col)\r\n    col++\r\n  col = 1\r\n  row++\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t do the diagonal checks, but it demonstrates the nested loop idea:\r\n\r\n1. The outer loop begins with `row = 1` and `col = 1`.\r\n2. The inner loop begins.\r\n3. The inner loop counts columns 1-3, then exits;\r\n4. The outer loop resets `col` to 1 and increments row\r\n5. The next iteration of the outer loop begins with the new row.\r\n6. Steps 2-5 repeat until until `row` = 4, at which point the outer loop exits and you&#39;re done.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example of this sort of thing in javascript, including the diagonal

It is a combination of both `display: inline-block` and `content: &quot;&quot;` on the `::after` pseudo element. You are basically telling the browser that right after the outer element you want to reserve an element&#39;s place in the DOM. \r\n\r\nYou could see that if you remove the `content: &quot;&quot;` although you are using inline-block the extra pseudo div after the `.outer` element would disappear. That is because although you stated a certain display mode you practically have no content in this element and the browser ignores your element because it has no fixed size in pixels and no actual content within it.\r\n\r\nThe reason `.outer` is growing is that its height is set to `auto` in default, if you would give it a fixed height in pixels it might not show the spare div.\r\n\r\nYour question has nothing to do with `line-height` or `overflow&#39;.\r\n\r\nMe personally I prefer not to use pseudo-classes like `::after` and `::before` in production. I prefer using regular divs and have my code more readable and understandable by other developers, anyway I hope I helped out.
