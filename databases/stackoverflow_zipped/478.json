A Python back-end (REST API), Apache proxy to enforce coarse grained access control in front of the REST API also acting as an SAML SP, a SAML IDP and an Angular front-end.\r\n\r\nA user opens the webpage which hits the Apache proxy in front of the Python Back-end and the Angular server. This proxy sees no session cookie and redirects the user to the SAML IDP using a HTTP 302 response code. The user authenticates and is redirected back to the Angular application including a SAML token. Apache (Mellon) issues a session cookie if the SAML token is valid.\r\n\r\nIn all requests to the API, this session cookie is included and the user is authenticated. This session expires after some time. Since Angular is an SPA (Single page application), there is no normal HTTP GET or POST being issued so the 302 redirect is not visible to the user. There are only XMLHTTPRequests to the API. So when the session expires, the browser receives an HTTP 302 that redirects to the IDP. The browser follows the redirect, fetches the HTML page of the IDP and present that as response to Angular. Angular tries to access the response from the IDP which results in a CORS (cross origin resource sharing) violation\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a CORS issue, Angular cannot read the HTML response from the API. I don&#39;t really want to solve the CORS issue. I would like the Angular application to know that the session has expired (because it receives a HTTP 302) and then just reloads the application. This reload is a normal HTTP GET which will receive the same HTTP 302. In this case, the 302 will be followed and the login form of the IDP will be presented to the user.\r\n\r\nOnce the user authenticates, he is redirected back to the Angular application and can continue. There is the slight drawback that some data entered in forms is lost but that is something we are willing to sacrifice for the time being.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [following issue][1], it might work with an HTTP interceptor in some browsers but it wont in others since the browser deals with the 302 and the HTTP interceptor will never even see that first response. When Angular tries to access the second response (the one from the IDP), it will try to access it and violate CORS. The IDP did not set CORS headers allowing the domain which servers our APP to access the responses.\r\n\r\nSome say it is best to change the 302 to a 401 which will reach the HTTP interceptor. But then we need to make a distinction between normal HTTP GET/POST requests and XMLHTTPRequests. Replying 302 to one of them and 401 to the other.\r\n\r\nI feel like there are many Angular applications with a REST API which use a SAML or OAuth IDP that they redirect to via HTTP 302. But I haven&#39;t found a solution.\r\n\r\nNow, the session expires and the 302 results in a CORS violation which results in an error in the browser console. The user does not get to see this behaviour and the application seems unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSorry, no code ;)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15165","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426033/angular-2-combined-with-http-302-redirect-oauth-or-saml-authentication","title":"Angular 2+ combined with HTTP 302 redirect OAuth or SAML authentication"},{"tags":["python","class","inheritance","set"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293134,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193597,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193597_58426026"},{"owner":{"reputation":8401,"user_id":678572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZ2Ia.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"O.rka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/678572/o-rka"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293603,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193773_58426026"},{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293685,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193811,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193811_58426026"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":487985,"user_id":104349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f4cefeedec5163556751d61625eedd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Roseman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104349/daniel-roseman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571294108,"creation_date":1571294108,"answer_id":58426285,"question_id":58426026,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58426285","body_markdown":"The special methods are all documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names);

You will need to somehow convey the amount of padding that was added from the encryption function to the decryption function so that you can truncate the decrypted data to the appropriate length.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs a somewhat unrelated note, when encrypting data with a public/private key pair, it is usually recommended to:\r\n\r\n- Create a random _symmetric_ key;\r\n- Encrypt that symmetric key with the public key;\r\n- Encrypt the data with the symmetric key;\r\n- Add the encrypted symmetric key in a header so that the receiver can know it.\r\n\r\nThis approach has two advantages:\r\n\r\n- Increased speed since symmetric cyphers are _much_ faster than asymmetric.\r\n- Increased security because it leaks less information about the asymmetric key pair, so even if an attacker manages to decrypt a message, she will not be able to decrypt other messages that use the same key pair.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426023/encrypt-decrypt-large-text-using-rusts-openssl-library/58426205#58426205","title":"Encrypt/Decrypt Large text using rust&#39;s openssl library"}],"owner":{"reputation":651,"user_id":3656414,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e61d1247b5d7ea2f20d4b7371d671dc7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rapidclock","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3656414/rapidclock"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58426205,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571296515,"creation_date":1571292836,"question_id":58426023,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58426023","body_markdown":"I am trying to write an API to use rust&#39;s openssl wrapper library to encrypt/decrypt files.\r\n\r\nThis is the library : https://docs.rs/openssl/0.10.25/openssl/index.html\r\n\r\nAll the examples in the documentation, show how to encrypt short strings using Padding. I want to encrypt possibly long files.\r\n\r\nThe problem is I can only encrypt up to the length of the key(using `Padding::NONE`). I want to possibly encrypt longer pieces of data.\r\n\r\nSo in order to get around that problem, I break the data into chunks, encrypt/decrypt each chunk, append the encrypted/decrypted chunk into a result Vector.

Load the file to encrypt into a `Vec&lt;u8&gt;` (or string slice, ultimately)\r\n 3. Use public key to encrypt the data\r\n 4. Write this encrypted data to a file\r\n 5.

while scrolling.\r\n\r\nActivity XML-\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n     &lt;TextView\r\n

\r\n            &lt;/mat-sidenav&gt;\r\n            &lt;mat-sidenav-content&gt;\r\n                Main content\r\n            &lt;/mat-sidenav-content&gt;\r\n        &lt;/mat-sidenav-container&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m trying to toggle the `&lt;mat-sidenav&gt;` using the button on my header, and I am referencing it with `#sideBar`\r\n\r\nIs this possible?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425962/accessing-template-reference-variables-from-a-view-to-another-view","title":"Accessing Template Reference Variables from a view to another view"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib","label","scatter-plot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1671,"user_id":4644942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/974991592561486/picture?type=large","display_name":"Yugandhar Chaudhari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4644942/yugandhar-chaudhari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292657,"post_id":58425960,"comment_id":103193411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels#comment103193411_58425960"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295103,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194441,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194441_58426288"},{"owner":{"reputation":6730,"user_id":9284423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdf3cf706787f4395327b7831db3e451?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Henry Yik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9284423/henry-yik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571295269,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194510,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194510_58426288"},{"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295410,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194591_58426288"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6730,"user_id":9284423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdf3cf706787f4395327b7831db3e451?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Henry Yik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9284423/henry-yik"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571294121,"creation_date":1571294121,"answer_id":58426288,"question_id":58425960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58426288","body_markdown":"You need both `x` and `y` when you annotate.\r\n\r\n    for i, txt in enumerate(dates):\r\n        ax.annotate(txt, (dates[i],PM_25[i]))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#58426288","title":"Scatter plot to add Dates as data labels"}],"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58426288,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571294121,"creation_date":1571292514,"question_id":58425960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58425960","body_markdown":"Plotting scatters I am using below:\r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters\r\n    register_matplotlib_converters()\r\n\r\n    dates = [&#39;2015-12-20&#39;,&#39;2015-09-12&#39;,&#39;2015-08-12&#39;,&#39;2015-06-12&#39;]  \r\n    PM_25 = [68, 66, 55, 46]\r\n\r\n    dates = [pd.to_datetime(d) for d in dates]\r\n\r\n    plt.scatter(dates, PM_25, s =50, c = &#39;red&#39;)\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\nFor each of the scatters, I want to add data label &#39;date&#39;

How can I UNION ALL results from multiple crosstab queries that rely on large tables that are linked to MySQL?**\r\n\r\nI have 6 crosstab queries in MS Access that return around 100 fields (I am not in a position to change this queries). These crosstab queries select data from linked tables that are in a MySQL server. What I want to do is combine all of these queries together into a single output using UNION ALL.\r\n\r\nI first tried the following code:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_1\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_2\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_3\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_4\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_5\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_6\r\n\r\nIn line with this post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13846776/union-all-query-too-many-fields-defined), this does not work due to a &quot;too many fields error&quot;. In essence, because each query returns around 100 fields, unioning 3 or more of the queries exceeds MS Access&#39;s 255 field limit. \r\n\r\nMy next attempted work around was to nest the code like so:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      (\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          query_1\r\n        UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          (\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_2\r\n            UNION ALL\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_3\r\n          ) AS a\r\n      ) AS b\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      (\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          query_4\r\n        UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          (\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_5\r\n            UNION ALL\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_6\r\n          ) AS c\r\n      ) AS d;\r\n\r\nThis gets around the &quot;too many fields&quot; error but results in a &quot;ODBC--call failed&quot; error that says &quot;[MySQL][ODBC 8.0(w) Driver][mysqld-8.0.18]You have an error in your SQL syntax;check the manual that corresponds...&quot; I believe this error is related to Access not playing nice with large linked tables from MySQL because I ran into the same error when I was trying to union multiple tables together like so:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_1\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_2\r\n    ...\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_6\r\n\r\nThe way I got around that when combining tables was to change the union query to a pass-through query. That worked perfectly when I was unioning tables but does not work when unioning the results of crosstab queries. Trying the pass-through approach here just gives me an uninformative &quot;ODBC -- call failed&quot; error. I assume this is related to not being able to include crosstab queries in a pass-through query but I&#39;m not sure. \r\n\r\nMany thanks for any help.\r\n\r\nSome additional notes based on comments:\r\n\r\n-The code works fine if I only try to union 2 queries, 3 or more causes errors.\r\n\r\n-The queries satisfy the following requirements for a UNION: 1) Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns 2)The columns must also have similar data types 3)The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order.\r\n\r\n-The results of each query have 109 fields (3 varchar fields, 3 integer fields and 103 float fields)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425954/union-multiple-queries-that-select-from-linked-tables-in-access","title":"Union multiple queries that select from linked tables in Access"},{"tags":["octave"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":664,"user_id":2637261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000143030829/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2637261/rich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292635,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103193405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103193405_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":9646453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fXL-iJJbZy8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/qjYjhq0euO8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Glen Veigas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9646453/glen-veigas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":664,"user_id":2637261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000143030829/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2637261/rich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298164,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103195928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103195928_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310349,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103202855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103202855_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571310518,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103202954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103202954_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310704,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103203063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103203063_58425951"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571321743,"creation_date":1571321743,"answer_id":58434744,"question_id":58425951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58434744","body_markdown":"Not sure this is what you&#39;re after, but you can create an image and assign it a callback function directly.

Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nThis is the function I created to show alarm time selections:\r\n\r\n    function alarmMenu(){\r\n\r\n      let ahours = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmhrs)\r\n      let hrs = 12\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= hrs; i++) {\r\n        ahours.options[ahours.options.length] = new Option( i &lt;      10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n      let amins = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmmins&quot;);\r\n      let min = 59;\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= min; i++) {\r\n        amins.options[amins.options.length] = new Option(i &lt; 10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n      let asecs = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmsecs&quot;);\r\n      let sec = 59;\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= sec; i++) {\r\n         asecs.options[asecs.options.length] = new Option(i &lt; 10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n     }\r\n    alarmMenu();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425896/trouble-selecting-values-on-vanilla-js-alarm-clock","title":"Trouble selecting values on vanilla JS alarm clock"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":73451,"user_id":637853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72baa38005eb8de126b2dd2e6fa1d660?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/637853/thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292434,"post_id":58425894,"comment_id":103193333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound#comment103193333_58425894"},{"owner":{"reputation":692,"user_id":8413680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b35e13c3fd753de156fd841e2c1d322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sujay Mohan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8413680/sujay-mohan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293964,"post_id":58425894,"comment_id":103193932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound#comment103193932_58425894"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":73451,"user_id":637853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72baa38005eb8de126b2dd2e6fa1d660?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/637853/thomas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571292565,"post_id":58425942,"comment_id":103193386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound/58425942#comment103193386_58425942"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12230672,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2838905999466608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Caspar Ng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12230672/caspar-ng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295696,"post_id":58425942,"comment_id":103194709,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound/58425942#comment103194709_58425942"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10062,"user_id":7606764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ff66904cb49ba020965898e8dd6b9d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andronicus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7606764/andronicus"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571292420,"creation_date":1571292420,"answer_id":58425942,"question_id":58425894,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58425942","body_markdown":"In the inner loop you&#39;re defining a constraint to the wrong counter.

(If a popover presentation controller isn&#39;t right for handling something like this, I&#39;d love to know) \r\n\r\nThe issue I have run into with using a ```UIPopoverPresentationController``` is that I can set its position with ``` self.popoverPresentationController.sourceRect = CGRectMake(point.x, point.y, 0,0); ``` where ```point``` refers to a CGPoint that determines the center of the popover view. If I could somehow animate this popover view&#39;s center from one point to another that would solve all of my problems, but I can&#39;t figure out anything that would make this work. \r\n\r\nI can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s my inexperience with this sort of thing but every approach I have tried just feels hacky, so any help on doing this the right way is very much so appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425892/animating-a-uipopoverpresentationcontroller-views-center-position","title":"Animating a UIPopoverPresentationController

They are features of processes.\r\n\r\nWe may be familiar with the `export` syntax of some shells to set environment variables for child processes but that is the shell&#39;s syntax. It has nothing to do with environment variables themselves. C/C++ for example don&#39;t use `export` instead uses the [`setenv()`][1] function do set environment variables (indeed, internally that&#39;s what bash/sh/ksh etc do when implementing `export`).\r\n\r\nIn node.js, the mechanism for reading and setting environment variables is via `process.env`.\r\n\r\n### Why asking a shell to do it don&#39;t work\r\n\r\nThis is not merely a node.js issue. It also won&#39;t work in bash:\r\n\r\nIn **exporter.sh**:\r\n\r\n    #! /bin/bash\r\n\r\n    export DB_DATABASE=$1\r\n\r\nIn **exec.sh**:\r\n\r\n    #! /bin/bash\r\n\r\n    ./exporter.sh foo\r\n    echo $DB_DATABASE ;# does not print &quot;foo&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is a core security feature of unixen: **other users should not be allowed to mess with your process**. The way this policy is enforced in the case of the environment is that only a parent process can set the environment of the child process. A child process **is not allowed** to set the environment of the parent process. The assumption is that the child process **belongs** to the parent process so you should be allowed to do what you want to a program - but since the parent process (you) don&#39;t belong to the child process the child is not allowed to mess with the parent&#39;s environment.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why your attempt to use `export` doesn&#39;t work. It actually works (the variables are indeed created in the subshell) but is not allowed to change the environment of it&#39;s parent (the node.js process)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Any help would be really appreciated. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425863/add-the-index-of-a-row-to-list-if-condition-is-met","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"add the index of a row to list if condition is met"},{"tags":["php","mysql","laravel","eloquent"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12803,"user_id":916000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eumU0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Taha Paksu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/916000/taha-paksu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292244,"post_id":58425862,"comment_id":103193236,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425862/laravel-eloquent-relation-error-call-to-undefined-relationship#comment103193236_58425862"},{"owner":{"reputation":1454,"user_id":4279414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0336d945f64c13c3da44e863c0d9aba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rp9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4279414/rp9"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292251,"post_id":58425862,"comment_id":103193239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425862/laravel-eloquent-relation-error-call-to-undefined-relationship#comment103193239_58425862"},{"owner":{"reputation":1109,"user_id":9763011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5Xh7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gayan S.

Start of changes for service refresh 2 fix pack 10On AIX&#174;, Linux and Windows systems, the default range is 0 - 57 GB. For larger heap sizes, you can try to use compressed references by explicitly setting -Xcompressedrefs.End of changes for service refresh 2 fix pack 10 However, larger heap sizes might result in an out of memory condition at run time because the VM requires some memory at low addresses. You might be able to resolve an out of memory condition in low addresses by using the -Xmcrs option.\r\n\r\nSo basically, at least this build of the JDK only supports compressedrefs, and in order to use that, I must set it manually since my Xmx is above the range where it is enabled by default, but that fails because my OS already allocated to much of &lt;4GB memory ranges, but some is needed to use compressedrefs. Since I can never guarantee that that won&#39;t be the case, is there any way I can use OpenJ9 without compressedrefs? And will that even yield the benefits in terms of memory consumption? Or is there any way I can use compressedrefs with very high Xmx settings?\r\n\r\nI also tried setting this option, but it didn&#39;t help: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/openj9/xmcrs/index.html?view=embed\r\n\r\nHow do I find the correct size for it? 1G and 64m failed.

I have read many articles and watched as many videos where people explain the basic definition and demonstrate the most basic construction of a higher order function. However, when I encounter an actual problem, I am lost. Here is an example (this is just for my personal study, not for a grade or for work):\r\n\r\n&gt;Write a maybe function that, given a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) and any other function, only calls the latter if the former returns true: maybe(x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn). If the predicate returns true, the value of x should be passed to myFn. If the predicate returns false, x should be returned unchanged.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand how to pass the value of x from one function to another...\r\n\r\nI solved this by adding a number argument to maybe, in addition to the predicate function and callback function. However, only two parameters are specified in the prompt, so I guess I&#39;m not doing it correctly. Here is what I did:\r\n\r\n\r\n    //predicate (evaluates to a boolean)\r\n    const notZero = function(x) {\r\n        //console.log(&#39;predicate runs!&#39;);\r\n        return x !== 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //callback (does something within the main function)\r\n    const plusOne = function(x) {\r\n        //console.log(&#39;callback runs!&#39;);\r\n        return x + 1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //checking if my predicate works\r\n    //test(notZero(1), true); // =&gt; test passed!\r\n    \r\n    //another callback\r\n    const myFn = function(x) {\r\n        return x - 100;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //main function\r\n    function maybe(number, predicate, callback) {\r\n        if (predicate(number) === true) {\r\n            //console.log(&#39;predicate === true&#39;);\r\n            //console.log(callback(number));\r\n            return callback(number);\r\n        } else {\r\n            return number;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    test(maybe(1, notZero, plusOne), 2);\r\n    test(maybe(0, notZero, plusOne), 0);\r\n    \r\n    test(maybe(101, x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn), 1);\r\n    test(maybe(99, x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn), 99);\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** As shared below, `maybe` can now take only 2 parameters (the predicate and the callback) because  it now returns a function whose parameter is `number`. That&#39;s the idea I was looking for.\r\n\r\n    function maybe(predicate, callback) {\r\n        \r\n        return function (number) {\r\n            if (predicate(number) === true) {\r\n                return callback(number);\r\n            } else {\r\n                return number;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425833/not-understanding-higher-order-functions-problem-example-using-javascript","title":"Not understanding higher order functions (problem example using javascript)"},{"tags":["laravel-5","google-oauth2","laravel-passport"],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8981977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yAxONf1Vhkg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH0/Y1tTHLmXa00/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dildar muhammad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8981977/dildar-muhammad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8981977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yAxONf1Vhkg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH0/Y1tTHLmXa00/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dildar muhammad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8981977/dildar-muhammad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571292272,"creation_date":1571291931,"last_edit_date":1571292272,"question_id":58425831,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58425831","body_markdown":"I have the same issue as discussed in the link below,\r\nmessage: Unauthenticated #802\r\n  but from that, unfortunately, I did not get my result, your kind reply will be very appreciated, I worked hard to search for this from last 2 days, but nothing find I am crazy at the moment.

There are exactly N groups in a regex, and N is the number of opening parenthesis.\r\n\r\nIn `((?:\\w)+)` there are 2 groups, one &quot;capturing&quot; (which creates a backreference) and one &quot;non-capturing&quot; (which does not).\r\n\r\nThe number of times a group matches in a target string does not change the number of backreferences. Imagine the chaos this would create. Except for the most simplistic cases, how would you even know if what you&#39;re looking for is `$3`, `$9` or `$9000`?\r\n\r\nIf your input string has a fixed structure, then your approach `Foo\\s*Bar\\s*(\\w+)\\s*Ref\\s*(\\w+)` with `$1` and `$2` is perfectly fine.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n&gt; Is it possible to create this kind of back referencing without\r\n&gt; specifically building capturing groups around each part of what you\r\n&gt; are trying to capture?\r\n\r\nNo. You must build one capturing group for each part that you are trying to backreference to. If a group matches multiple times, you will get the last instance of each match in the input.\r\n\r\nSome regex engines let you to access each instance of what a particular group has captured from the host language. For example [the .NET regex engine does that][1]. This is nice for post-processing, but the backreferences *themselves* (i.e. the `$1`) still work as above.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nAll that being said, the way to get `&#39;123445&#39;` and `&#39;ABC1234&#39;` out of `Foo Bar 123445 Ref ABC1234` in the way you were thinking of is to avoid regex and `string.split()` at the space, taking parts 2 and 3.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.regularexpressions.group.captures?view=netframework-4.8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425810/regex-referencing-captured-groups/58425948#58425948","title":"Regex referencing captured groups"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1036,"user_id":12031739,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBL53wM9WHYa9QeNIq3MJ4scErCBV3t3egXL6NI5w=k-s128","display_name":"Soc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12031739/soc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571297651,"creation_date":1571297651,"answer_id":58427241,"question_id":58425810,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58427241","body_markdown":"It isn&#39;t entirely clear what you are trying to match and what you want to substitute with based on your question.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of trying to get an answer for you, I&#39;m going to assume that you want to match any word that has a number and replace it with something else.\r\n\r\n`\\w*?\\d+\\w*?` will match any *word* with a digit in it, and with JavaScript (you didn&#39;t specify a language), you perform a manual substitution, or a dynamic one with a *replacer* function.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const expression = /\\b(\\w*?\\d+\\w*?)\\b/g;\r\n    const inputs = [\r\n      &#39;Foo Bar 123445 Ref ABC1234&#39;,\r\n      &#39;Hello World 123 Foo ABC123XYZ456&#39;\r\n    ];\r\n\r\n    // static string\r\n    console.log(inputs.map(i =&gt; i.replace(expression, &#39;**redacted**&#39;)));\r\n\r\n    // dynamic string\r\n    console.log(inputs.map(i =&gt; i.replace(expression, s =&gt; new Array(s.length).fill(&#39;*&#39;).join(&#39;&#39;))));\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425810/regex-referencing-captured-groups/58427241#58427241","title":"Regex referencing captured groups"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12230558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e11a48a3dae9661693e495f9e95579bb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Craigf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12230558/craigf"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58425948,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571297651,"creation_date":1571291845,"question_id":58425810,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58425810","body_markdown":"Firstly, I&#39;m very new to Regex so my apologies if this is a dumb question.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m just using an online Regex tester &lt;https://regex101.com&gt; (PCRE) to build the following scenario.\r\n\r\nI want to capture `123445` and `ABC1234` from the following sentence\r\n\r\n`Foo Bar 123445 Ref ABC1234`\r\n\r\nI just wanted to use a simple capturing group \r\n\r\n`((?:\\w)+)`\r\n\r\nWhich will identify 5 matching groups And then I could back reference it with `$3` and `$5`\r\n\r\nHowever when I attempt using Substitution with just one group, `$3`, I end up with the whole string.

If some insert has already happened, when job restart from failure on update, the insert cannot be rolled back, which means the sink must be idempotent, right?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426047/how-to-make-sure-exact-once-in-mapgroupswithstate-of-structured-streaming","title":"How to make sure exact-once in mapGroupsWithState of structured streaming"},{"tags":["batch-file"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293821,"post_id":58426044,"comment_id":103193866,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426044/bat-file-windows-parse-if-first-filename-character-is-digit#comment103193866_58426044"},{"owner":{"reputation":39569,"user_id":2152082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e4e4a832231681b8a80323832e8af00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2152082/stephan"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571299723,"post_id":58426044,"comment_id":103196729,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426044/bat-file-windows-parse-if-first-filename-character-is-digit#comment103196729_58426044"},{"owner":{"reputation":39569,"user_id":2152082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1e4e4a832231681b8a80323832e8af00?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2152082/stephan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571299930,"post_id":58426044,"comment_id":103196838,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426044/bat-file-windows-parse-if-first-filename-character-is-digit#comment103196838_58426044"}],"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":7114778,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/245467452bc0c0ffa05496295f55a179?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Josi Dunk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7114778/josi-dunk"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11347,"user_id":7818749,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec4a72453e116debb802d55e88c2572e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Gerhard Barnard","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7818749/gerhard-barnard"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571293398,"creation_date":1571292915,"last_edit_date":1571293398,"question_id":58426044,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58426044","body_markdown":"Hy,\r\n\r\ni am normally using linux and i would get the problem solved there.\r\nFor work i have to do a batch  script that automatically merges pdf files. it works, but i want a defined structure: The first digit of the file names\r\ndefines the order (1-5).\r\nFirst all documents (word, xls... etc)  get converted in a pdf. then these pdfs are merged according 1-5.

A Python back-end (REST API), Apache proxy to enforce coarse grained access control in front of the REST API also acting as an SAML SP, a SAML IDP and an Angular front-end.\r\n\r\nA user opens the webpage which hits the Apache proxy in front of the Python Back-end and the Angular server. This proxy sees no session cookie and redirects the user to the SAML IDP using a HTTP 302 response code. The user authenticates and is redirected back to the Angular application including a SAML token. Apache (Mellon) issues a session cookie if the SAML token is valid.\r\n\r\nIn all requests to the API, this session cookie is included and the user is authenticated. This session expires after some time. Since Angular is an SPA (Single page application), there is no normal HTTP GET or POST being issued so the 302 redirect is not visible to the user. There are only XMLHTTPRequests to the API. So when the session expires, the browser receives an HTTP 302 that redirects to the IDP. The browser follows the redirect, fetches the HTML page of the IDP and present that as response to Angular. Angular tries to access the response from the IDP which results in a CORS (cross origin resource sharing) violation\r\n\r\nFirst, there is a CORS issue, Angular cannot read the HTML response from the API. I don&#39;t really want to solve the CORS issue. I would like the Angular application to know that the session has expired (because it receives a HTTP 302) and then just reloads the application. This reload is a normal HTTP GET which will receive the same HTTP 302. In this case, the 302 will be followed and the login form of the IDP will be presented to the user.\r\n\r\nOnce the user authenticates, he is redirected back to the Angular application and can continue. There is the slight drawback that some data entered in forms is lost but that is something we are willing to sacrifice for the time being.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [following issue][1], it might work with an HTTP interceptor in some browsers but it wont in others since the browser deals with the 302 and the HTTP interceptor will never even see that first response. When Angular tries to access the second response (the one from the IDP), it will try to access it and violate CORS. The IDP did not set CORS headers allowing the domain which servers our APP to access the responses.\r\n\r\nSome say it is best to change the 302 to a 401 which will reach the HTTP interceptor. But then we need to make a distinction between normal HTTP GET/POST requests and XMLHTTPRequests. Replying 302 to one of them and 401 to the other.\r\n\r\nI feel like there are many Angular applications with a REST API which use a SAML or OAuth IDP that they redirect to via HTTP 302. But I haven&#39;t found a solution.\r\n\r\nNow, the session expires and the 302 results in a CORS violation which results in an error in the browser console. The user does not get to see this behaviour and the application seems unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSorry, no code ;)\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/15165","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426033/angular-2-combined-with-http-302-redirect-oauth-or-saml-authentication","title":"Angular 2+ combined with HTTP 302 redirect OAuth or SAML authentication"},{"tags":["python","class","inheritance","set"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293134,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193597,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193597_58426026"},{"owner":{"reputation":8401,"user_id":678572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kZ2Ia.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"O.rka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/678572/o-rka"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293603,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193773_58426026"},{"owner":{"reputation":42582,"user_id":5014455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/JTknr.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"juanpa.arrivillaga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5014455/juanpa-arrivillaga"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293685,"post_id":58426026,"comment_id":103193811,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58426026/how-to-add-set-comprehension-like-union-and-intersect-to-python-class#comment103193811_58426026"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":487985,"user_id":104349,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0f4cefeedec5163556751d61625eedd0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Roseman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104349/daniel-roseman"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571294108,"creation_date":1571294108,"answer_id":58426285,"question_id":58426026,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58426285","body_markdown":"The special methods are all documented [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names);

while scrolling.\r\n\r\nActivity XML-\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n     &lt;TextView\r\n

\r\n            &lt;/mat-sidenav&gt;\r\n            &lt;mat-sidenav-content&gt;\r\n                Main content\r\n            &lt;/mat-sidenav-content&gt;\r\n        &lt;/mat-sidenav-container&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nSo I&#39;m trying to toggle the `&lt;mat-sidenav&gt;` using the button on my header, and I am referencing it with `#sideBar`\r\n\r\nIs this possible?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425962/accessing-template-reference-variables-from-a-view-to-another-view","title":"Accessing Template Reference Variables from a view to another view"},{"tags":["python","matplotlib","label","scatter-plot"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1671,"user_id":4644942,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/974991592561486/picture?type=large","display_name":"Yugandhar Chaudhari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4644942/yugandhar-chaudhari"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292657,"post_id":58425960,"comment_id":103193411,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels#comment103193411_58425960"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295103,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194441,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194441_58426288"},{"owner":{"reputation":6730,"user_id":9284423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdf3cf706787f4395327b7831db3e451?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Henry Yik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9284423/henry-yik"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571295269,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194510,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194510_58426288"},{"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295410,"post_id":58426288,"comment_id":103194591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#comment103194591_58426288"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6730,"user_id":9284423,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fdf3cf706787f4395327b7831db3e451?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Henry Yik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9284423/henry-yik"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571294121,"creation_date":1571294121,"answer_id":58426288,"question_id":58425960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58426288","body_markdown":"You need both `x` and `y` when you annotate.\r\n\r\n    for i, txt in enumerate(dates):\r\n        ax.annotate(txt, (dates[i],PM_25[i]))","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425960/scatter-plot-to-add-dates-as-data-labels/58426288#58426288","title":"Scatter plot to add Dates as data labels"}],"owner":{"reputation":2922,"user_id":2998077,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/F7irZ.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2998077/mark-k"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58426288,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571294121,"creation_date":1571292514,"question_id":58425960,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58425960","body_markdown":"Plotting scatters I am using below:\r\n\r\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\n    import pandas as pd\r\n    from pandas.plotting import register_matplotlib_converters\r\n    register_matplotlib_converters()\r\n\r\n    dates = [&#39;2015-12-20&#39;,&#39;2015-09-12&#39;,&#39;2015-08-12&#39;,&#39;2015-06-12&#39;]  \r\n    PM_25 = [68, 66, 55, 46]\r\n\r\n    dates = [pd.to_datetime(d) for d in dates]\r\n\r\n    plt.scatter(dates, PM_25, s =50, c = &#39;red&#39;)\r\n    plt.show()\r\n\r\n\r\nFor each of the scatters, I want to add data label &#39;date&#39;

How can I UNION ALL results from multiple crosstab queries that rely on large tables that are linked to MySQL?**\r\n\r\nI have 6 crosstab queries in MS Access that return around 100 fields (I am not in a position to change this queries). These crosstab queries select data from linked tables that are in a MySQL server. What I want to do is combine all of these queries together into a single output using UNION ALL.\r\n\r\nI first tried the following code:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_1\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_2\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_3\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_4\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_5\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      query_6\r\n\r\nIn line with this post (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13846776/union-all-query-too-many-fields-defined), this does not work due to a &quot;too many fields error&quot;. In essence, because each query returns around 100 fields, unioning 3 or more of the queries exceeds MS Access&#39;s 255 field limit. \r\n\r\nMy next attempted work around was to nest the code like so:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      (\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          query_1\r\n        UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          (\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_2\r\n            UNION ALL\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_3\r\n          ) AS a\r\n      ) AS b\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      (\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          query_4\r\n        UNION ALL\r\n        SELECT\r\n          *\r\n        FROM\r\n          (\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_5\r\n            UNION ALL\r\n            SELECT\r\n              *\r\n            FROM\r\n              query_6\r\n          ) AS c\r\n      ) AS d;\r\n\r\nThis gets around the &quot;too many fields&quot; error but results in a &quot;ODBC--call failed&quot; error that says &quot;[MySQL][ODBC 8.0(w) Driver][mysqld-8.0.18]You have an error in your SQL syntax;check the manual that corresponds...&quot; I believe this error is related to Access not playing nice with large linked tables from MySQL because I ran into the same error when I was trying to union multiple tables together like so:\r\n\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_1\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_2\r\n    ...\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT\r\n      *\r\n    FROM\r\n      table_6\r\n\r\nThe way I got around that when combining tables was to change the union query to a pass-through query. That worked perfectly when I was unioning tables but does not work when unioning the results of crosstab queries. Trying the pass-through approach here just gives me an uninformative &quot;ODBC -- call failed&quot; error. I assume this is related to not being able to include crosstab queries in a pass-through query but I&#39;m not sure. \r\n\r\nMany thanks for any help.\r\n\r\nSome additional notes based on comments:\r\n\r\n-The code works fine if I only try to union 2 queries, 3 or more causes errors.\r\n\r\n-The queries satisfy the following requirements for a UNION: 1) Each SELECT statement within UNION must have the same number of columns 2)The columns must also have similar data types 3)The columns in each SELECT statement must also be in the same order.\r\n\r\n-The results of each query have 109 fields (3 varchar fields, 3 integer fields and 103 float fields)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425954/union-multiple-queries-that-select-from-linked-tables-in-access","title":"Union multiple queries that select from linked tables in Access"},{"tags":["octave"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":664,"user_id":2637261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000143030829/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2637261/rich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292635,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103193405,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103193405_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":9646453,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fXL-iJJbZy8/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAE4/qjYjhq0euO8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Glen Veigas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9646453/glen-veigas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":664,"user_id":2637261,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100000143030829/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2637261/rich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571298164,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103195928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103195928_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310349,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103202855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103202855_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571310518,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103202954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103202954_58425951"},{"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571310704,"post_id":58425951,"comment_id":103203063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425951/how-to-place-an-image-over-a-button-or-a-panel-in-octave#comment103203063_58425951"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12148,"user_id":4183191,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8ce0d78cc78f51ee79cec5088effe3ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tasos Papastylianou","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4183191/tasos-papastylianou"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571321743,"creation_date":1571321743,"answer_id":58434744,"question_id":58425951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58434744","body_markdown":"Not sure this is what you&#39;re after, but you can create an image and assign it a callback function directly.

Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nThis is the function I created to show alarm time selections:\r\n\r\n    function alarmMenu(){\r\n\r\n      let ahours = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmhrs)\r\n      let hrs = 12\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= hrs; i++) {\r\n        ahours.options[ahours.options.length] = new Option( i &lt;      10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n      let amins = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmmins&quot;);\r\n      let min = 59;\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= min; i++) {\r\n        amins.options[amins.options.length] = new Option(i &lt; 10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n      let asecs = document.querySelector(&quot;#alarmsecs&quot;);\r\n      let sec = 59;\r\n      for (i=0; i &lt;= sec; i++) {\r\n         asecs.options[asecs.options.length] = new Option(i &lt; 10 ? &quot;0&quot; + i : i, i);\r\n      }\r\n     }\r\n    alarmMenu();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425896/trouble-selecting-values-on-vanilla-js-alarm-clock","title":"Trouble selecting values on vanilla JS alarm clock"},{"tags":["java"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":73451,"user_id":637853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72baa38005eb8de126b2dd2e6fa1d660?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/637853/thomas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292434,"post_id":58425894,"comment_id":103193333,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound#comment103193333_58425894"},{"owner":{"reputation":692,"user_id":8413680,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b35e13c3fd753de156fd841e2c1d322?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sujay Mohan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8413680/sujay-mohan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571293964,"post_id":58425894,"comment_id":103193932,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound#comment103193932_58425894"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":73451,"user_id":637853,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72baa38005eb8de126b2dd2e6fa1d660?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/637853/thomas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571292565,"post_id":58425942,"comment_id":103193386,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound/58425942#comment103193386_58425942"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12230672,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2838905999466608/picture?type=large","display_name":"Caspar Ng","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12230672/caspar-ng"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571295696,"post_id":58425942,"comment_id":103194709,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425894/arraylist-index-out-of-bound/58425942#comment103194709_58425942"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":10062,"user_id":7606764,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ff66904cb49ba020965898e8dd6b9d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Andronicus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7606764/andronicus"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":false,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571292420,"creation_date":1571292420,"answer_id":58425942,"question_id":58425894,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58425942","body_markdown":"In the inner loop you&#39;re defining a constraint to the wrong counter.

(If a popover presentation controller isn&#39;t right for handling something like this, I&#39;d love to know) \r\n\r\nThe issue I have run into with using a ```UIPopoverPresentationController``` is that I can set its position with ``` self.popoverPresentationController.sourceRect = CGRectMake(point.x, point.y, 0,0); ``` where ```point``` refers to a CGPoint that determines the center of the popover view. If I could somehow animate this popover view&#39;s center from one point to another that would solve all of my problems, but I can&#39;t figure out anything that would make this work. \r\n\r\nI can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s my inexperience with this sort of thing but every approach I have tried just feels hacky, so any help on doing this the right way is very much so appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425892/animating-a-uipopoverpresentationcontroller-views-center-position","title":"Animating a UIPopoverPresentationController

They are features of processes.\r\n\r\nWe may be familiar with the `export` syntax of some shells to set environment variables for child processes but that is the shell&#39;s syntax. It has nothing to do with environment variables themselves. C/C++ for example don&#39;t use `export` instead uses the [`setenv()`][1] function do set environment variables (indeed, internally that&#39;s what bash/sh/ksh etc do when implementing `export`).\r\n\r\nIn node.js, the mechanism for reading and setting environment variables is via `process.env`.\r\n\r\n### Why asking a shell to do it don&#39;t work\r\n\r\nThis is not merely a node.js issue. It also won&#39;t work in bash:\r\n\r\nIn **exporter.sh**:\r\n\r\n    #! /bin/bash\r\n\r\n    export DB_DATABASE=$1\r\n\r\nIn **exec.sh**:\r\n\r\n    #! /bin/bash\r\n\r\n    ./exporter.sh foo\r\n    echo $DB_DATABASE ;# does not print &quot;foo&quot;\r\n\r\nThis is a core security feature of unixen: **other users should not be allowed to mess with your process**. The way this policy is enforced in the case of the environment is that only a parent process can set the environment of the child process. A child process **is not allowed** to set the environment of the parent process. The assumption is that the child process **belongs** to the parent process so you should be allowed to do what you want to a program - but since the parent process (you) don&#39;t belong to the child process the child is not allowed to mess with the parent&#39;s environment.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why your attempt to use `export` doesn&#39;t work. It actually works (the variables are indeed created in the subshell) but is not allowed to change the environment of it&#39;s parent (the node.js process)\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Any help would be really appreciated. \r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425863/add-the-index-of-a-row-to-list-if-condition-is-met","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"add the index of a row to list if condition is met"},{"tags":["php","mysql","laravel","eloquent"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":12803,"user_id":916000,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/eumU0.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Taha Paksu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/916000/taha-paksu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292244,"post_id":58425862,"comment_id":103193236,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425862/laravel-eloquent-relation-error-call-to-undefined-relationship#comment103193236_58425862"},{"owner":{"reputation":1454,"user_id":4279414,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0336d945f64c13c3da44e863c0d9aba?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rp9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4279414/rp9"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571292251,"post_id":58425862,"comment_id":103193239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425862/laravel-eloquent-relation-error-call-to-undefined-relationship#comment103193239_58425862"},{"owner":{"reputation":1109,"user_id":9763011,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/e5Xh7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Gayan S.

Start of changes for service refresh 2 fix pack 10On AIX&#174;, Linux and Windows systems, the default range is 0 - 57 GB. For larger heap sizes, you can try to use compressed references by explicitly setting -Xcompressedrefs.End of changes for service refresh 2 fix pack 10 However, larger heap sizes might result in an out of memory condition at run time because the VM requires some memory at low addresses. You might be able to resolve an out of memory condition in low addresses by using the -Xmcrs option.\r\n\r\nSo basically, at least this build of the JDK only supports compressedrefs, and in order to use that, I must set it manually since my Xmx is above the range where it is enabled by default, but that fails because my OS already allocated to much of &lt;4GB memory ranges, but some is needed to use compressedrefs. Since I can never guarantee that that won&#39;t be the case, is there any way I can use OpenJ9 without compressedrefs? And will that even yield the benefits in terms of memory consumption? Or is there any way I can use compressedrefs with very high Xmx settings?\r\n\r\nI also tried setting this option, but it didn&#39;t help: https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/openj9/xmcrs/index.html?view=embed\r\n\r\nHow do I find the correct size for it? 1G and 64m failed.

I have read many articles and watched as many videos where people explain the basic definition and demonstrate the most basic construction of a higher order function. However, when I encounter an actual problem, I am lost. Here is an example (this is just for my personal study, not for a grade or for work):\r\n\r\n&gt;Write a maybe function that, given a predicate (a function that returns a boolean value) and any other function, only calls the latter if the former returns true: maybe(x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn). If the predicate returns true, the value of x should be passed to myFn. If the predicate returns false, x should be returned unchanged.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t understand how to pass the value of x from one function to another...\r\n\r\nI solved this by adding a number argument to maybe, in addition to the predicate function and callback function. However, only two parameters are specified in the prompt, so I guess I&#39;m not doing it correctly. Here is what I did:\r\n\r\n\r\n    //predicate (evaluates to a boolean)\r\n    const notZero = function(x) {\r\n        //console.log(&#39;predicate runs!&#39;);\r\n        return x !== 0;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //callback (does something within the main function)\r\n    const plusOne = function(x) {\r\n        //console.log(&#39;callback runs!&#39;);\r\n        return x + 1;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //checking if my predicate works\r\n    //test(notZero(1), true); // =&gt; test passed!\r\n    \r\n    //another callback\r\n    const myFn = function(x) {\r\n        return x - 100;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    //main function\r\n    function maybe(number, predicate, callback) {\r\n        if (predicate(number) === true) {\r\n            //console.log(&#39;predicate === true&#39;);\r\n            //console.log(callback(number));\r\n            return callback(number);\r\n        } else {\r\n            return number;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    test(maybe(1, notZero, plusOne), 2);\r\n    test(maybe(0, notZero, plusOne), 0);\r\n    \r\n    test(maybe(101, x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn), 1);\r\n    test(maybe(99, x =&gt; x &gt; 100, myFn), 99);\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT:** As shared below, `maybe` can now take only 2 parameters (the predicate and the callback) because  it now returns a function whose parameter is `number`. That&#39;s the idea I was looking for.\r\n\r\n    function maybe(predicate, callback) {\r\n        \r\n        return function (number) {\r\n            if (predicate(number) === true) {\r\n                return callback(number);\r\n            } else {\r\n                return number;\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58425833/not-understanding-higher-order-functions-problem-example-using-javascript","title":"Not understanding higher order functions (problem example using javascript)"},{"tags":["laravel-5","google-oauth2","laravel-passport"],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8981977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yAxONf1Vhkg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH0/Y1tTHLmXa00/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dildar muhammad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8981977/dildar-muhammad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":8981977,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-yAxONf1Vhkg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAH0/Y1tTHLmXa00/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dildar muhammad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8981977/dildar-muhammad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571292272,"creation_date":1571291931,"last_edit_date":1571292272,"question_id":58425831,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58425831","body_markdown":"I have the same issue as discussed in the link below,\r\nmessage: Unauthenticated #802\r\n  but from that, unfortunately, I did not get my result, your kind reply will be very appreciated, I worked hard to search for this from last 2 days, but nothing find I am crazy at the moment.
