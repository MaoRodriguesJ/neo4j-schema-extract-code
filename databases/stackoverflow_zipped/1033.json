finally got it working\r\n\r\nSo using the suggestion in the comments, I downloaded postman and copied all my info into postman - when i made the request there, I got a 200!\r\n\r\nSo then i looked back and tried to figure out what was different and there were a few things:\r\n\r\nFirst the hmac sign function was missing an `&amp;`\r\n\r\nNew function (added another `&amp;` after the url):\r\n```\r\n    private fun hmacSign(requestType: RequestType, url: String, params: Map&lt;String, String&gt;): String {\r\n        val type = &quot;HmacSHA1&quot;\r\n        val key = &quot;$API_SECRET&amp;$tokenSecret&quot;\r\n        val value = makeURLSafe(&quot;${requestType.string}&amp;$url&amp;${getURLString(params.toList().sortedBy { it.first }.toMap())}&quot;)\r\n\r\n        val mac = javax.crypto.Mac.getInstance(type)\r\n        val secret = javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec(key.toByteArray(), type)\r\n        mac.init(secret)\r\n        val digest = mac.doFinal(value.toByteArray())\r\n\r\n        return makeURLSafe(Base64.encodeToString(digest, NO_WRAP))\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext I noticed my auth header had its params seperated with `&amp;` but they all should&#39;ve been replaced with `,` - i also needed to surround each of my values in `&quot;&quot;`\r\n\r\nSo it looked like: \r\n```\r\nOAuth

these changes i started getting 200!\r\n\r\nHopefully this helps someone else (though im sure its unlikely considering how specific these issues

am trying to make use of the twitter api, and am setting up a handler to deal with twitter api requests.\r\n\r\nTo do this I am using an `HTTPUrlConnection` and following the Twitter api docs\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve managed to get authenticated using the 3-legged OAuth process, but am stuck when actually trying to make requests with the oauth token.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of what my auth headers look like:\r\n```\r\nAccept=*/*, \r\nConnection=close, \r\nUser-Agent=OAuth gem v0.4.4, \r\nContent-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded, \r\nAuthorization=\r\nOAuth

each header in the auth header I add it to my HTTP `GET` call like this:\r\n\r\n    urlConnection.setRequestProperty(header.key, header.value)\r\n\r\nNote that `Authorization` points to one string \r\n```\r\nOAuth oauth_consumer_key=****&amp;oauth_nonce=bbmthpoiuq&amp;oauth_signature=*****%3Doauth_signature_method=HMAC-SHA1oauth_timestamp=1570586135&amp;oauth_token=*****&amp;oauth_version=1.0,Host=api.twitter.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following params are collected as follows:\r\n\r\n - `oauth_consumer_key` is my application API key\r\n\r\n - `oauth_signature` is computed by the `hmacSign` function below\r\n\r\n - `oauth_token` is the &quot;oauth_token&quot; received in the response from `/oauth/access_token`\r\n\r\nThe `hmacSign` function:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    private fun hmacSign(requestType: RequestType, url: String, params: Map&lt;String, String&gt;): String {\r\n        val type = &quot;HmacSHA1&quot;\r\n        val key = &quot;$API_SECRET&amp;$tokenSecret&quot;\r\n        val value = makeURLSafe(&quot;${requestType.string}&amp;$url${getURLString(params.toList().sortedBy { it.first }.toMap())}&quot;)\r\n\r\n        val mac = javax.crypto.Mac.getInstance(type)\r\n        val secret = javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec(key.toByteArray(), type)\r\n        mac.init(secret)\r\n        val digest = mac.doFinal(value.toByteArray())\r\n\r\n        return

&quot;%2520&quot;)\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected fun getURLString(params: Map&lt;String, Any&gt;) : String {\r\n        if (params.isEmpty()) return &quot;&quot;\r\n\r\n        return params.toList().fold(&quot;?&quot;) { total, current -&gt;\r\n            var updated = total\r\n\r\n            updated += if (total == &quot;?&quot;)\r\n                &quot;${current.first}=${current.second}&quot;\r\n            else\r\n                &quot;&amp;${current.first}=${current.second}&quot;\r\n\r\n            updated\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the `GET` call I&#39;m referring to, `tokenSecret` would be the oauth secret received from `/oauth/access_token`\r\n\r\nAfter i make the call I get a `400: Bad Request`\r\n\r\nIs there anything obvious I&#39;m doing wrong?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nUpdate: By putting the params at the end of the url like `?key=value&amp;key2=value2...` instead of a 400 I get a 401.

`re` module it&#39;s possible to use escaping for the replace pattern. eg:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef my_replace(string, src, dst):\r\n    import re\r\n    return re.sub(re.escape(src), dst, string)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works for the most-part, the `dst` string may include `&quot;\\\\9&quot;` for example.\r\n\r\nThis causes an issue:\r\n\r\n- `\\\\1`, `\\\\2` ... etc in `dst`, literals will be interpreted as groups.\r\n- using `re.escape(dst)` causes `.` to be changed to `\\.`.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to escape the destination without introducing redundant character escaping?\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nExample usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_replace(&quot;My Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Bar&quot;)\r\n&#39;My Bar&#39;\r\n```\r\nSo far, so good.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_replace(&quot;My Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, &quot;Bar\\\\Baz&quot;)\r\n...\r\nre.error: bad escape \\B at position 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis tries to interpret `\\B` as having a special meaning.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_replace(&quot;My Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, re.escape(&quot;Bar\\\\Baz&quot;))\r\n&#39;My Bar\\\\Baz&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorks!\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; my_replace(&quot;My Foo&quot;, &quot;Foo&quot;, re.escape(&quot;Bar\\\\Baz.&quot;))\r\n&#39;My Bar\\\\Baz\\\\.&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `.` gets escaped when we don&#39;t want that.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nWhile in this case `str.replace` can be used, the question about destination string remains useful since there may be times we want to use other features of `re.sub` such as the ability to ignore case.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296661/python-regex-string-escaping-for-re-sub-replace-argument","title":"Python regex string escaping for re.sub replace

I need to create a LogIn for users. So I used the default Django User class and authentication to do that.    \r\nBut there&#39;s a problem. The API for the LogIn (in the /users/login/ endpoint) is defined with the following format: {&quot;user&quot;:value, &quot;pass&quot;:value}.    \r\nAnd the User model given by Django has two important fields: &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot;.    \r\nAs I said before, I want them to be &quot;user&quot; instead of &quot;username&quot;, and &quot;pass&quot; instead of &quot;password&quot;. Because that&#39;s how the JSON in the POSTs requests will be like in the front-end.    \r\nI know I can make a RenameField, but that will only change the column name in the database, it won&#39;t change how Django asks for the username and password in the body of the POST request.    \r\n\r\nI need to send (in a POST request in postman) a JSON to the /users/login/ endpoint, with the following format: {&quot;user&quot;:value, &quot;pass&quot;:value}.    \r\nBut the Django User model doesn&#39;t know what are those fields, it doesn&#39;t need user, it needs username, and it doesn&#39;t need pass, it needs password, so I&#39;m getting an error.    \r\nI need to change somehow the keys &quot;user&quot; and &quot;pass&quot; in the given JSON to be &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot;. Or, to change the field names in the User model. Otherwise, the response will be: \r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;username&quot;: [\r\n        &quot;This field is required.&quot;\r\n    ],\r\n    &quot;password&quot;: [\r\n        &quot;This field is required.&quot;\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBecause, as I said, Django is getting &quot;user&quot; and &quot;pass&quot;, and it doesn&#39;t recognize those keys... It needs &quot;username&quot; and &quot;password&quot; fields.    \r\ni.e: I need to change somehow from:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;user&quot;: value,\r\n    &quot;pass&quot;: value\r\n}\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    &quot;username&quot;: value,\r\n    &quot;password&quot;: value\r\n}\r\n```\r\nOr viceversa.    \r\nI&#39;ve tried not to create my own User model, and to use the model given by Django, I think it&#39;s not a good idea to create one...    \r\nI think I can add a new file called serializer.py and do something there but I&#39;m not sure how, and I didn&#39;t found anything in the documentation.    \r\n\r\nIf they&#39;re useful, these are my files.    \r\nurls.py:    \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom rest_framework.authtoken.views import obtain_auth_token\r\nfrom django.contrib import admin\r\nfrom catanAPI.catan import views\r\nfrom django.urls import path\r\n\r\nurlpatterns = [\r\n    path(&#39;admin/&#39;, admin.site.urls),\r\n    path(&#39;users/login/&#39;, obtain_auth_token)\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nsettings.py\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSTALLED_APPS = [\r\n    #...\r\n    &#39;django.contrib.auth&#39;,\r\n    &#39;rest_framework&#39;,\r\n

&#39;rest_framework.authentication.TokenAuthentication&#39;,\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI know this question may be stupid or something, but I&#39;m new in Django, and I&#39;m trying to learn.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296651/rename-django-user-fields","title":"Rename Django User

How can you ensure that the workload in a specific pod takes priority over another pod when the node&#39;s kernel is scheduling CPU and the CPU is fully burdened?  In a typical Linux host my thoughts on contention between processes immediately goes to &#39;niceness&#39; of the processes, however I don&#39;t see any equivalent k8s mechanism allowing for specification of CPU scheduling priority between the processes within pods on a node.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve read of the [newest capabilities][1] provided by k8s which (if I interpret the documentation correctly) is just providing a mechanism for CPU pinning to pods which doesn&#39;t really scratch my itch.  I&#39;d still like to maximize CPU utilization by the &quot;second class&quot; pods if the higher priority pods don&#39;t have an active workload while allowing the higher priority workload to have CPU scheduling priority should the need arise.\r\n\r\nSo far, having not found a satisfactory answer I&#39;m thinking that the community will opt for an architectural solution, like auto-scaling or segregating the workloads between nodes.  I don&#39;t consider these to be truly addressing the issue, but really just throwing more CPUs at it which is what I&#39;d like to avoid.

This is defined in the [JLS &#167;9.7.4](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se13/html/jls-9.html#jls-9.7.4):\r\n\r\n&gt;**It is a compile-time error if an annotation of type T applies to a type (or any part of a type) in a type context, and T is applicable in type contexts, and the annotation is not admissible.**\r\n\r\n&gt;For example, assume an annotation type TA which is meta-annotated with just `@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)`. The terms `@TA java.lang.Object` and `java.@TA lang.Object` are illegal because the simple name to which @TA is closest is classified as a package name. On the other hand, `java.lang.@TA Object` is legal.\r\n\r\nThe type declaration of `org.checkerframework.checker.nullness.qual@Nullable` is:\r\n\r\n    @Target({ElementType.TYPE_USE, ElementType.TYPE_PARAMETER})\r\n\r\nSo it is applying to this rule.\r\n\r\nThat this structure doesn&#39;t break the execution, since package `java.util` and class name `Optional` were split, can be seen when we look at the compiled code using `javap -c [compiled class name]`:\r\n\r\n    class just.a.test.Main {\r\n      just.a.test.Main();\r\n        Code:\r\n           0: aload_0\r\n           1: invokespecial #1          // Method java/lang/Object.&quot;&lt;init&gt;&quot;:()V\r\n           4: return\r\n    \r\n      public static &lt;T&gt; java.util.Optional&lt;T&gt; toJavaUtil(blub.Optional&lt;T&gt;);\r\n        Code:\r\n           0: aload_0\r\n           1: ifnonnull     8\r\n           4: aconst_null\r\n           5: goto          12\r\n           8: aload_0\r\n           9: invokevirtual #2          // Method blub/Optional.toJavaUtil:()Ljava/util/Optional;\r\n          12: areturn\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;*(`blub.Optional` is a local class where I copied the Guava code in, in order to get a minimal example to de-/compile)*&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the annotation doesn&#39;t exist there anymore. It is only a marker for the compiler to prevent a warning when the method returns null (and a hint for the source code readers), but it won&#39;t be included in the compiled code.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThis compiler error also applies to variables like:\r\n\r\n    private @Nullable2 java.util.Optional&lt;?&gt; o;\r\n\r\nBut can become acceptable when the annotation additionally gets the target type  `ElementType.FIELD`, as written in the same JLS clause:\r\n\r\n&gt;If TA is additionally meta-annotated with `@Target(ElementType.FIELD)`, then the term `@TA java.lang.Object` is legal in locations which are both declaration and type contexts, such as a field declaration `@TA java.lang.Object f;`. Here, @TA is deemed to apply to the declaration of f (and not to the type java.lang.Object) because TA is applicable in the field declaration context.

Make sure in your *app build.gradle file* that the *compileSdkVersion* and *targetSdkVersion* are both set to ***28***\r\n\r\n3. Remove all the lines with the comment &quot;*Remove*&quot; from your main *app build.gradle file*:\r\n\r\n        android {\r\n            compileSdkVersion 28\r\n    \r\n        lintOptions {\r\n            disable &#39;InvalidPackage&#39;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        defaultConfig {\r\n            applicationId &quot;YOUR_APPLICATION_ID&quot;\r\n            minSdkVersion 16\r\n            targetSdkVersion 28\r\n            versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()\r\n            versionName flutterVersionName\r\n            testInstrumentationRunner &quot;android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner&quot; //Remove\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        buildTypes {\r\n            release {\r\n                signingConfig signingConfigs.debug\r\n            }\r\n           }\r\n         }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        dependencies {\r\n            testImplementation &#39;junit:junit:4.12&#39;\r\n            androidTestImplementation &#39;com.android.support.test:runner:1.0.2&#39; // Remove\r\n            androidTestImplementation &#39;com.android.support.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.0.2&#39; // Remove\r\n        }\r\n\r\n4.

The generic term for `*args` is &quot;positional arguments&quot;, and generally you&#39;re going to want to refer to them individually as &quot;the `n`th positional argument&quot;. Keyword arguments `**kwargs` should usually be mentioned individually with acceptable keys and values on a case-by-case basis, unless the kwargs in your method is serving as a proxy for the kwargs in someone else&#39;s method, in which case you can also just write &quot;Keyword arguments are the same as [other method], see that documentation for more details&quot;.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe example you gave is a hard one in this case, mainly because it&#39;s kind of bad practice - a method should do one thing; if you have a method do two different things depending on the value of a flag, then why not just have two methods and make the caller call one of them explicitly? (further reading: [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/))\r\n\r\nNumpy&#39;s documentation standards seem to go even further, generally eschewing generic `**kwargs` entirely (in favor of explicitly named keywords), and preferring named positional arguments that you can refer to in docstrings. The document you linked doesn&#39;t provide explicit advice on the subject, but I would lean towards `*args` as the &#39;variable name&#39; (keeping the asterisk there so as to denote that they are positional arguments) with `integers` as the value (note the plural), then note in the description explicitly that it&#39;s representing positional arguments. Alternatively, what I&#39;ve done below, just list it as &quot;positional arguments&quot; explicitly (after all, this docstring format isn&#39;t useful for type hinting anyway). \r\n\r\nThis is largely personal preference, but I would document your function as so:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef get_matrix(*args, arbitrary=True):\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    If `arbitrary` is True (default), generates a random matrix, \r\n    with x and y bounds represented by the first two given \r\n    positional args, and returns it.\r\n\r\n    If `arbitrary` is False, then instead coerces the first positional\r\n    argument into a np.array, and returns that.\r\n\r\n    parameters\r\n    ----------\r\n    positional args: ints\r\n        purpose depends on the value of arbitrary (see above)\r\n    arbitrary: bool\r\n        determines the behavior of the function (see above)\r\n\r\n    returns\r\n    -------\r\n    if arbitrary is true, a random 2D array of defined size.\r\n    otherwise, the first positional argument coerced to a np.array\r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    if arbitrary == True:\r\n        return np.random.randint(-10,10, size=[args[0],args[1]])\r\n    else:\r\n        return np.array(args[0])","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296477/how-do-i-write-a-docstring-for-the-following-python-function/58296672#58296672","title":"How do I write a docstring for the following Python function?"}],"owner":{"reputation":155,"user_id":10606620,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4542a80976d2bffd0eb23eea5370fdf7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Nelver","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10606620/nelver"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570610240,"accepted_answer_id":58296672,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570592427,"creation_date":1570590102,"question_id":58296477,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296477","body_markdown":"Suppose I have following function:\r\n\r\n    def get_matrix(*args, arbitrary=True):\r\n        if arbitrary == True:\r\n            return np.random.randint(-10,10, size=[args[0],args[1]])\r\n        else:\r\n            return np.array(args[0])\r\n\r\nSo the function either \r\n\r\n1. generates the matrix (if arbitrary == True); in this case it takes two int arguments.\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2.

I am not sure if put &#39;df&#39; in &#39;for result in df &#39; is a correct way or vice versa. \r\n\r\n\r\n  ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296439/how-to-set-parameter-to-loop-from-specific-row-in-excel-using-python","title":"How to set parameter to loop from specific row in excel using python"},{"tags":["django","django-rest-framework"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1558,"user_id":1242827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02766ec440c27a10a29ccb482ffad949?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RBasniak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1242827/rbasniak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570655180,"post_id":58296721,"comment_id":102985669,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296438/django-django-rest-framework-simplejwt-protect-view/58296721#comment102985669_58296721"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":478,"user_id":10642829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c645952dd6429fbc12aacec1fd9433a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mehdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10642829/mehdi"},"last_editor":{"reputation":478,"user_id":10642829,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c645952dd6429fbc12aacec1fd9433a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mehdi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10642829/mehdi"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570687151,"last_edit_date":1570687151,"creation_date":1570592191,"answer_id":58296721,"question_id":58296438,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58296721","body_markdown":"try:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated\r\nclass AuthTestView(views.APIView):\r\n    http_method_names = [&#39;get&#39;]\r\n    permission_classes=[IsAuthenticated] \r\n    def get(self, request):\r\n        response_data = {\r\n            &#39;result&#39;: &#39;Restricted access test ok.&#39;,\r\n        }\r\n        return Response(data=response_data\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58296438/django-django-rest-framework-simplejwt-protect-view/58296721#58296721","title":"Django + django-rest-framework-simplejwt protect view"}],"owner":{"reputation":1558,"user_id":1242827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02766ec440c27a10a29ccb482ffad949?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"RBasniak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1242827/rbasniak"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58296721,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570687151,"creation_date":1570589898,"question_id":58296438,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58296438","body_markdown":"I just installed `django-rest-framework-simplejwt` in a Django project and if I send an invalid `Authentication Bearer &lt;&lt;token&gt;&gt;` header, it blocks my request with 401 code.
