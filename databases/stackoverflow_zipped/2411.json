What I noticed is that on my device at least (Snapdragon 835) ResizeBilinear_2 and ArgMax takes an insane amount of time. If you disable CPU fallback you will see that ResizeBilinear_2 is actually not supported since in the deeplab implementation they used align_corner=true.\r\n\r\nIf you pick ResizeBilinear_1 as the output layer there will be a significant improvement to the inference time with the trade off of you not having the bilinear resize layer and argmax which you will have to implement yourself.\r\n\r\nBut even then using the gpu I was only able to reach around 200 ms runtime. With the DSP I did manage to get around 100 ms.\r\n\r\nAlso be sure that your kit has opencl support in it, otherwise gpu runtime won&#39;t work afaik.\r\n\r\nSide Note: I&#39;m currently still testing stuff with deeplab + snpe as well. I noticed that comparing this and TFLITE gpu delegate theres some differences in the output. While SNPE in general is about twice as fast theres a lot of segmentation artifacts errors which can result in unusable model. Check this out https://developer.qualcomm.com/forum/qdn-forums/software/snapdragon-neural-processing-engine-sdk/34844\r\n\r\nWhat I found out so far is that if you drop the output stride to 16 not only will you get double the inference speed, said artifacts seems to be less visible. Of course you lose some accuracy doing so.

In detail, line 20 `self.prev_agents = deepcopy(self.agents)`:\r\n\r\n1. For each agent in `self.agents`, create a copy.\r\n2. Each agent stores a reference `self.observer`.\r\n3. Because we are doing a deep copy, we need to copy that observer as well.\r\n4. The `observer` has various attributes among which there is `self.prev_agents`.\r\n5. Since we are still computing the right hand side of `self.prev_agents = deepcopy(self.agents)`, `self.prev_agents` is still `None` (line 14).\r\n6. So each of the agent copies now has a reference `self.observer` which is a copy of the original observer and that copy has `self.prev_agents is None`.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s why in the subsequent call to `step` the agent references the wrong observer and thus the error. I don&#39;t see why you would want to copy the observer at all, so using `copy.copy` instead of `copy.deepcopy` should solve the problem.\r\n\r\nSide note: deep copying each agent will also encounter a reference cycle of the form `agent -&gt; observer -&gt; self.agents -&gt; agent` but [`copy.deepcopy`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html#copy.deepcopy) avoids this problem by keeping a memo dict of already copied objects.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963581/implementation-of-agent-based-model/57963979#57963979","title":"Implementation of agent based model"}],"owner":{"reputation":794,"user_id":301175,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e040ed4f71fe26b38811d538e428098?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yorian","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/301175/yorian"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568665597,"creation_date":1568663658,"question_id":57963581,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963581","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to implement an agent based model in python (without using the Mesa package) as practice.

The nested loop goes through all surveys, excluding those unfinished and then another loop goes through all answers for each survey and next loop goes through all results for each answer within each survey. Moreover, the results are given in random order so they need to be sorted, that happens at the end of the nested loop.\r\n\r\nHere is the sample of that JSON: https://jsonblob.com/2bffde45-d8c0-11e9-9ec2-759b3e404be9\r\n\r\n```\r\nlibrary(rjson)\r\n\r\nsurvey.report &lt;- fromJSON(file = &quot;sample.json&quot;)\r\nvalues.df &lt;- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 13, nrow = 0))\r\nlistofitems &lt;- list() \r\n\r\nfor (a in 1:length(surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]])) {\r\n  if (length(surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;answers&quot;]]) == 0) {\r\n    listofitems[i] &lt;- 0\r\n    i &lt;- i + 1\r\n  } else {\r\n    for (o in 1:length(surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;answers&quot;]])) {\r\n      surveyid &lt;- surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;answers&quot;]][[o]][[&quot;item&quot;]]\r\n      i &lt;- i + 1\r\n      listofitems[i] &lt;- surveyid \r\n      for (w in 1:length(surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;answers&quot;]][[o]][[&quot;results&quot;]])) {\r\n        answers &lt;- surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;answers&quot;]][[o]][[&quot;results&quot;]]\r\n      } \r\n      survey = surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;id&quot;]]\r\n      participant = surveytoll[[&quot;surveys&quot;]][[a]][[&quot;participant&quot;]]\r\n      \r\n      list.items &lt;- list()\r\n      list.values &lt;- list()\r\n      list.items &lt;- sapply(answers, function(x) x[[1]])\r\n      list.values &lt;- sapply(answers, function(x) x[[2]])\r\n      lwtt &lt;- t(t(list.values)) \r\n      lpbtt &lt;- t(t(list.items))\r\n      lplw &lt;- cbind.data.frame(lpbtt,lwtt)\r\n      lplw$lwtt &lt;- as.character(lplw$lwtt)\r\n      lplw$lpbtt &lt;- as.character(lplw$lpbtt)\r\n      lplw[order(lplw$lpbtt),]\r\n      value &lt;- t(lplw$lwtt) \r\n      values.row &lt;- cbind(survey,participant,listofitems[i],value)\r\n      values.df &lt;- rbind.data.frame(values.df,values.row) \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nvalues.df\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe loop generates data frame with 13 columns: survey id, participant, item and 10 results.

These are `CCmdTarget` methods and can be accessed using `AfxGetApp()` as well as any `CWnd` derived class.\r\n\r\nNote that using a global variable in a multi-threaded environment with both UI thread and worker threads, depending on how the global is used and accessed by the threads, you may create a race condition.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963545/changing-mouse-cursor-to-wait-cursor-then-starting-worker-thread-and-changing-ba/57964545#57964545","title":"changing mouse cursor to wait cursor then starting worker thread and changing back on thread completion"}],"owner":{"reputation":11443,"user_id":1466970,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGMwA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Chambers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466970/richard-chambers"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11443,"user_id":1466970,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/kGMwA.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Richard Chambers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466970/richard-chambers"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":86,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57964545,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568750411,"creation_date":1568663459,"last_edit_date":1568664461,"question_id":57963545,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963545","body_markdown":"In an older MFC application I have to perform a network connect request to another computer which may take a number of seconds in the case of incorrect computer name before the request times out. So I am starting up a worker thread to make the initial connection so that the user interface is still responsive.\r\n\r\nThe network connect request is triggered by the user selecting a menu item which brings up a dialog to fill in the target computer information. When the user clicks the Ok button on the dialog, the network connection request is processed using the worker thread.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to do is to change the mouse cursor to a wait indicator and then remove the wait indicator once the connection is actually made or the attempt times out.\r\n\r\nWhat I am running into is that the mouse cursor is remaining a pointer and the mouse cursor is not changing to a wait indicator.\r\n\r\nWhat I originally thought was that I could just change the mouse cursor using the `BeginWaitCursor()` function. However that has no effect that I can see.\r\n\r\nFurther reading indicates that I also need to have an override of the `afx_msg BOOL OnSetCursor(CWnd* pWnd, UINT nHitTest, UINT message)` method of the `CScrollView` class however I can&#39;t seem to find anything helpful that describes what I need to do in that method. The `OnSetCursor()` method seems to be called for a variety of reasons and just moving the mouse causes a breakpoint in that method to be triggered.\r\n\r\nIt looks like that in the `OnSetCursor()` method I should detect the current application state and based on that use the `SetCursor()` function to set one of the possible mouse cursor styles which have been previously loaded with `LoadCursor()`. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36170858/prevent-mfc-application-to-change-cursor-back-to-default-icon as well as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6369244/change-cursor-for-the-duration-of-a-thread\r\n\r\nHowever I am unsure at to whether that is how it is actually done and what the parameters that are provided with the `OnSetCursor()` actually mean and how to use them.\r\n\r\nIn the second of the two above SO postings it appears a global is being used to decide if the default `CView::OnSetCursor()` method is being called or not.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963545/changing-mouse-cursor-to-wait-cursor-then-starting-worker-thread-and-changing-ba","title":"changing mouse cursor to wait cursor then starting worker thread and changing back on thread completion"},{"tags":["arrays","bash","slurm"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":29252,"user_id":1763614,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/3nhVJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"damienfrancois","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1763614/damienfrancois"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568721051,"creation_date":1568721051,"answer_id":57973621,"question_id":57963543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57973621","body_markdown":"Your script does not have a [shebang][1] so it is interpreted using the default shell, which can often be `sh` or `dash`, which do not understand that syntax. \r\n\r\nTry adding `#! /usr/bin/env bash` as the first line of your submission script.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963543/bad-substitution-from-slurm-array/57973621#57973621","title":"Bad substitution from SLURM array"}],"owner":{"reputation":35,"user_id":7823398,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b5aeda8fa711f242cf5cf2e17c9a600d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Marion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7823398/marion"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568721051,"creation_date":1568663447,"question_id":57963543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963543","body_markdown":"The following batch script is meant to run a function against an array of files:\r\n\r\n```#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n#SBATCH --job-name=&quot;my_job&quot;\r\n#SBATCH --partition=long\r\n#SBATCH --nodes=2\r\n#SBATCH --ntasks=1\r\n#SBATCH --mem=30G\r\n#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4\r\n#SBATCH --time=3-00:00:00\r\n#SBATCH --export=ALL\r\n#SBATCH --output=array_%A_%a.out  \r\n#SBATCH --error=array_%A_%a.err\r\n\r\nFILE=${FILES[$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID]}\r\nbase=$( basename $1 .fasta)\r\necho ${FILE}\r\nOUTFILE=~/data/${base}.afa\r\n\r\nmnj -in ${${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID}}  \\\r\n-out $OUTFILE\r\n ```\r\n\r\n\r\nIt returns the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/var/lib/slurm-llnl/slurmd/job512763/slurm_script: line 12:\r\n\r\n: bad substitution\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom the command line, `NUMFILES=${#FILES[@]}` returns the appropriate number of files and `echo $FILES` returns the expected output.\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find any SLURM array examples that run through a directory of files without `FILE=${FILES[$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID]}`.

do perfectly  understand you want to use the latest and greatest toolchain  from your prefered, mainstream Linux distribution, but this is not always going well.\r\n\r\nIn my humble opinion, you should:\r\n\r\n -  stick to [Linaro][1] or [ARM][2] gcc toolchains,\r\n -  in the case of your specific cortex-m related project, stick to a gcc toolchain more specifically targeting the cortex-m, i.e. the so called &#39;[GNU Arm Embedded Toolchain][3]&#39;. \r\n\r\nSome remarks:\r\n\r\n - There are probably excellent reasons why ARM itself is providing two specifics toolchains for the two profiles,\r\n - Latest GCC toolchain version available from Linaro is 7.4.1, but if they used to point to it by default on this [page][1], they now pointing to version 7.2.1, which may (or not) ring a bell regarding 7.4.1 - there are no official 9.2 versions available yet.\r\n - Latest GCC toolchain available from ARM is 8.3.1 for cortex-m, and 8.3 for cortex-a - there are no official 9.2 versions available yet.\r\n \r\nBack to your specific issue now: I was able to compile your project using the following steps:\r\n\r\n    wget

For easier compilation, I use containers (both Podman and Docker should be fine):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake image\r\nmake libopencm3\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works just fine and generates a `main.elf` file about 874 kB in size. But that is as long as I fix the `arm-none-eabi-gcc-cs` to `7.4.0` in the Dockerfile.\r\n\r\nIf I remove the specific version or set it to `9.2.0`, then I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\n/usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/9.2.0/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: main.elf section `.text&#39; will not fit in region `rom&#39;\r\n/usr/lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/9.2.0/../../../../arm-none-eabi/bin/ld: region `rom&#39; overflowed by 5288 bytes\r\ncollect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\nmake: *** [opencm3/libopencm3.rules.mk:204: main.elf] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat could have changed between those versions?\r\n\r\nIf I add this line to my Makefile:\r\n\r\n```\r\nLDFLAGS         += -specs=nano.specs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen it compiles just fine with version `9.2.0` and generates a `main.elf` file about 885 kB in size. But I wonder if the performance would be the same (or equivalent) as before.\r\n\r\nUpdate\r\n------\r\n\r\nI am expecting some performance differences, of course, just like I was expecting some differences in the binary size. But I was wondering if I could expect a higher than 20% difference in performance (specially if it could be now 20% slower).\r\n\r\nThe new binary is less than 2% bigger, and I would consider this to be &quot;the same&quot; as before. :-D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963506/section-text-will-not-fit-after-upgrading-arm-none-eabi-gcc","title":"Section `text` will not fit after upgrading `arm-none-eabi-gcc`"},{"tags":["html","css","flask"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":86,"user_id":1086495,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9680f597f92018b362bed3a8ed09eab?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"c0c0b33f","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1086495/c0c0b33f"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568664206,"creation_date":1568664206,"answer_id":57963708,"question_id":57963502,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57963708","body_markdown":"It sounds like your CSS file is cached.

It&#39;s purpose is to decouple the\r\n&gt; command operation from the sending and receiving objects so that\r\n&gt; neither has knowledge of the other.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Wikipedia, [The mediator pattern][2] is described as:\r\n\r\n&gt; With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is\r\n&gt; encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate\r\n&gt; directly with each other, but instead communicate through the\r\n&gt; mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects,\r\n&gt; thereby reducing coupling.\r\n\r\nSo, as my understanding both of them are separating the command form the commander which allow us to decouple from the caller.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve seen some projects on Github that are using the Command Dispatcher Pattern to invoke the desired handler for the requested command while the other ones are using mediator pattern to dispatch the messages.

wrote a macro which as a tiny task on the side also calculates the average of around 39000 different values. I noticed that using WorksheetFunction.Average and calculating the average &quot;step-wise&quot; yield different results, but only at the 15th digit after the decimal point. By calculating &quot;step-wise&quot; I mean adding up each value to a total_sum variable, counting the amount of values in another variable and then dividing the former by the latter.\r\nThe 15th digit after the decimal point might be considered negligible but I find it unsettling nonetheless. Shouldn&#39;t those two values be exactly the same? They are when I use less values and as the macro might be applied on far more values than 39000 (100k+), I&#39;m worried the error might increase.\r\n\r\nSo my questions are: What could cause the difference and more importantly which method is more precise? \r\n\r\nWhat I tried was to declare all variables in the &quot;step-wise&quot; calculation as Variant to avoid using the wrong data type in any of those steps.\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963451/vba-excel-which-average-more-precise-worksheetfunction-or-step-wise","title":"VBA (Excel) which average more precise, worksheetfunction or step-wise"},{"tags":["javascript","async-await"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663244,"post_id":57963445,"comment_id":102338079,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963445/async-function-not-waiting-for-promise-to-be-resolved#comment102338079_57963445"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11924131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72776fc80939a65d5160509e274a174d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alucard_pendragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11924131/alucard-pendragon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663430,"post_id":57963445,"comment_id":102338162,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963445/async-function-not-waiting-for-promise-to-be-resolved#comment102338162_57963445"},{"owner":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568663469,"post_id":57963445,"comment_id":102338172,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963445/async-function-not-waiting-for-promise-to-be-resolved#comment102338172_57963445"},{"owner":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663506,"post_id":57963445,"comment_id":102338190,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963445/async-function-not-waiting-for-promise-to-be-resolved#comment102338190_57963445"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11924131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72776fc80939a65d5160509e274a174d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alucard_pendragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11924131/alucard-pendragon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":411477,"user_id":1048572,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":77,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f2c4de95e8f4f8f5a71c3aaf0ed312a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bergi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1048572/bergi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568663857,"post_id":57963445,"comment_id":102338320,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57963445/async-function-not-waiting-for-promise-to-be-resolved#comment102338320_57963445"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11924131,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/72776fc80939a65d5160509e274a174d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"alucard_pendragon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11924131/alucard-pendragon"},"last_editor":{"reputation":475006,"user_id":1491895,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/82f9e178a16364bf561d0ed4da09a35d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Barmar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1491895/barmar"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568663560,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568663359,"creation_date":1568662956,"last_edit_date":1568663359,"question_id":57963445,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57963445","body_markdown":"I am making a call to the databricks API using Javascript.
