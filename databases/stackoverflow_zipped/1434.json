   ffmpeg -i input -filter_complex &quot;[0]scale=iw/3:-1[pip];[0]convolution,colorbalance[bg];[bg][pip]overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10[v]&quot; -map &quot;[v]&quot; -map 0:a -c:a copy output\r\n\r\nThis is a simplified command. You&#39;ll need to enter your convolution and colorbalance values and integrate it into your batch file.\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n\r\n1. `[0]` refers to the first (and only in this case) input file and is the input for the scale filter. The output from scale is arbitrarily named `[pip]`. You can give it just about any name you prefer. See [Filtering Introduction, Filtergraph description, and Filtergraph syntax][1] for more info. \r\n2. `[0]` is also used as the input for convolution. The output from convolution is fed directly to colorbalance. Linear chains of filters are connected via a comma (see above link). The output from colorbalance is named `[bg]`.\r\n3. overlay needs two inputs which are `[bg]` and `[pip]`. `[pip]` is overlaid on `[bg]`. The output from overlay is named `[v]`.\r\n4. [`-map` option][2] is used to manually select the streams to put into the output. It is generally a good idea to get into the habit to use `-map` unless you fully understand the default [stream selection][3] behavior.\r\n5. I&#39;m assuming the input audio is AAC, so you can stream copy the audio instead of re-encoding it. If not then you can remove `-c:a copy` and a default encoder will be chosen depending on your output file format or you can choose a specific encoder.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#Filtering-Introduction\r\n  [2]: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Advanced-options\r\n  [3]: https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html#Stream-selection","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201025/ffmpeg-color-grading-video-material-and-display-original-source-as-picture-in/58209711#58209711","title":"ffmpeg - color-grading video material AND display original source as picture-in-picture, using -filter_complex"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153405,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/197471cf346e7250a9d8a130dc090fe2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"raven","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153405/raven"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12153405,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/197471cf346e7250a9d8a130dc090fe2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"raven","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12153405/raven"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570135865,"last_edit_date":1570135865,"creation_date":1570064498,"answer_id":58211103,"question_id":58201025,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58211103","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a revised (now working) color-grading batch file. \r\n\r\n    [revised code (M$ batch file)]\r\n\r\n    @echo off\r\n    cls\r\n    rem ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n    rem Purpose: color correction, saturation, sharpening for underwater video. \r\n    rem Function: color-grades video, inserts the original video in lower right\r\n    rem corner as a PIP (picture-in-picture) overlay, for comparison\r\n    rem Error handling: basic. \r\n    rem                 Checks for availability of input video (%IN%)\r\n    rem                 Deletes possibly pre-existing output file (%OUTP%) \r\n    rem Inputs: %IN%\r\n    rem Outputs: %OUTP% (with ungraded video as PIP) \r\n    rem Parameters: To be tested with actual GoPro footage (manual 6500K setting) \r\n    rem ------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    ::declarations/defines::\r\n    set &quot;IN=&lt;path-to-movie&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;OUTP=&lt;path-to-movie&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;FFMPG=&lt;path-to-executable&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\n    ::test availability of input file::\r\n    if not exist %IN% (\r\n    echo &quot;Error: No input file (in.mp4) found.

To quicker gauge the effect of my color settings (trial-and-error, as of yet),  would like to see the original input video stream as a PIP (e.g., scaled down to 50% or even 30%), in the bottom-right corner of the converted output movie.\r\n\r\nI have one input movie that is going to be color graded. The PIP should use the original as an input, just a scaled-down version of it. \r\n\r\nI would like to use ffmpeg&#39;s &quot;-filter_complex&quot; option to do the PIP, but all examples I can find on &quot;-filter_complex&quot; would use two already existing movies. Instead, I would like to make the color-corrected stream an on-the-fly input to &quot;-filter_complex&quot;, which then renders the PIP. \r\n\r\nIs that doable, all in one go? \r\n\r\nBoth the individual snippets below work fine, I now would like to combine these and skip the creation of an intermediate color-graded TMP output which then gets combined, with the original, in a final PIP creation process. \r\nYour help combining these two separate steps into one single &quot;-filter_complex&quot; action is greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nraven. \r\n\r\n\r\n    [existing code snippets (M$ batch files)]\r\n\r\n    ::declarations/defines::\r\n    set &quot;INPUT=&lt;path-to-movie&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;TMP=&lt;path-to-intermediate-output-movie&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;OUTPUT=&lt;path-to-movie&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;FFMPG=&lt;path-to-executable&gt;&quot;\r\n    set &quot;QU=9&quot; :: quality settings\r\n\r\n    set &quot;CONV=&#39;&quot;0 -1 0 -1 5 -1 0 -1 0:0 -1 0 -1 5 -1 0 -1 0:0 -1 0 -1 5 -1 \r\n    0 -1 0:0 -1 0 -1 5 -1 0 -1 0&#39;&quot;&quot; :: sharpening convolution filter\r\n\r\n    ::color-grading part::\r\n    %FFMPG% -i %INPUT% -vf convolution=%CONV%,colorbalance=rs=%rs%:gs=%gs%:bs=%bs%:rm=%rm%:gm=%gm%:bm=%bm%:rh=%rh%:gh=%gh%:bh=%bh% -q:v %QU% -codec:v mpeg4 %TMP%\r\n\r\n    ::PIP part::\r\n    %FFMPG% -i %TMP% -i %INPUT% -filter_complex &quot;[1]scale=iw/3:ih/3 \r\n    [pip]; [0][pip] overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10&quot; -q:v \r\n    %QU% -codec:v mpeg4 %OUTPUT%\r\n    \r\n    [/existing code]","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201025/ffmpeg-color-grading-video-material-and-display-original-source-as-picture-in","title":"ffmpeg - color-grading video material AND display original source as picture-in-picture, using -filter_complex"},{"tags":["laravel","mailchimp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":482,"user_id":4421206,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100002776560181/picture?type=large","display_name":"Junaid Ahmad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4421206/junaid-ahmad"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017601,"post_id":58201017,"comment_id":102779989,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201017/laravel-invalid-mailchimp-api-key-supplied#comment102779989_58201017"},{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":11014627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f95bf4bd3c21cb41648e02e46013795?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"I.

Fold 1 (inner) -&gt; calculate top 5 features with filter -&gt; calculate model performance\r\n1. Fold 2 (inner) -&gt; calculate top 5 features with filter -&gt; calculate model performance\r\n1.

You are basically asking &quot;give me the top 5 features according to the filter from the inner loop and only train the model on these in the outer fold&quot;.

Since observations are different from the ones of the inner folds in the nested resampling (case 1), your Lasso learner will come up with different filter scores (the model fitting happens with different observations) and possibly a different ranking.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIIUC your thinking is that the filter values are generated again for each outer fold in the nested resampling setting. This is not the case and also would not have any benefit as the features to fit the model with have already been chosen during optimization in the inner folds.\r\n\r\nFor the outer folds, the model is only trained with the selected features suggested from the inner loop. The same logic would apply to tuning: &quot;Give me the best hyperparameters across all folds from the inner loop (I&#39;ll tell you how to do so) and then fit a model on the outer fold using these settings&quot;. \r\n\r\nMaybe it helps to transfer this logic to tuning: You also would not call `tuneParams()` standalone on each outer fold and assume that you get the same hyperparameters returned as your inner nested resampling optimization would have come up with, wouldn&#39;t you?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58201011/mlr-unexpected-result-when-comparing-output-from-getfilteredfeatures-and-genera/58215171#58215171","title":"mlr: Unexpected result when comparing output from getFilteredFeatures and generateFilterValuesData"}],"owner":{"reputation":349,"user_id":7843296,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9524a5753d18c6c63612f8e8f1958ae4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"panda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7843296/panda"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58215171,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570091336,"creation_date":1570017383,"question_id":58201011,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58201011","body_markdown":"I am using two different methods to get the features selected by a filter. I expected these methods to return the same values but they are not doing so and I do not understand why. The reason for using the second method is so that I can access the scores that were used to select the features, not just the names of the selected features.\r\n\r\nThe filter is a univariate model score filter using the Cox model to measure performance, and selecting the top 5 features. I create a resample instance, so that both methods are using the same samples in each fold.\r\n\r\nThe first method is the usual one - using makeFilterWrapper to wrap the filter around a Lasso model, and calling getFilteredFeatures via the extract option of resample. My understanding is that getFilteredFeatures returns the features that were selected by the filter,before being passed to the Lasso model.\r\n\r\nIn the second method, I use subsetTask to create the same sub-task that getFilteredFeatures would be using in each CV fold, and then I call generateFilterValuesData to get the values the filter generated.

There&#39;s a TCP server written using Netty.  \r\n2. There are multiple clients establishing a connection to the server.  \r\n3. After establishing the connection, messages can be sent in the two direction.  \r\n\r\nTo be able to deliver messages to correct recipients I need to maintain channel outside of handlers. I&#39;m aware of `ChannelGroup` which let me easily implement a broadcast server (one message to all clients).  \r\n\r\nNow the requirement is how to write to specific channel.  \r\nI&#39;m thinking to have a `ChannelGroup` and enrich it with client-specific id map (with a `Map&lt;ClientId, ChannelId&gt;` mapping client-id to channel-id).

The main problem I wanted to solve was to avoid deleting my `QNetworkReply*` object manually, instead I wanted it to be automatically destroyed when an instance of `NetworkRequest` is deleted. In order to achieve this, I used a `std::unique_ptr` as a private member of my `NetworkRequest` class so when the class is destroyed, the `unique_ptr` automatically cleans the object in memory. Furthermore, by default `std::unique_ptr` deletes the object it hold upon reassignment, so whenever I call the `send` function in my, I can assign a new object to the smart pointer and the previous object in memory will get deleted automatically. One thing to notice, was the Qt docs recommend that `QNetworkReply*` should be deleted using `QObject::deleteLater()` (it is not fully clear to me why this is the case), in order to do this one can just use a custom deleter.\r\nSo in my code, I declared a private member as following:\r\n```\r\nprivate:\r\n    struct deleteLaterDeletor\r\n    {\r\n        void operator()(QObject *object) const\r\n        {\r\n            if(object) {\r\n                object-&gt;deleteLater();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    };\r\n\r\n    using ReplyPointer = std::unique_ptr&lt;QNetworkReply, deleteLaterDeletor&gt;;\r\n\r\n    ReplyPointer m_reply;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in my `send` function:\r\n```\r\n        m_reply = ReplyPointer(mNetManager-&gt;get(netRequest));\r\n```\r\nObviously, in the signature of signal and slots I have to pass the raw pointer (`m_reply.get()`). \r\n\r\n(`QSharedPointer` can also be used instead of `std::unique_ptr`)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200997/smart-pointers-and-avoid-manual-memory-management-when-using-qnetworkaccessmanag/58204803#58204803","title":"Smart pointers and avoid manual memory management when using QNetworkAccessManager"}],"owner":{"reputation":206,"user_id":1466885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f3dbc479f96b0133eb624336e7842c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"daljit97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466885/daljit97"},"last_editor":{"reputation":206,"user_id":1466885,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f3dbc479f96b0133eb624336e7842c9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"daljit97","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1466885/daljit97"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570030565,"creation_date":1570017314,"last_edit_date":1570017696,"question_id":58200997,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200997","body_markdown":"I have the following class which calls some HTTP API request to a server:\r\n```\r\nclass NetworkRequest : public QObject {\r\n\r\npublic:\r\n    NetworkRequest(QNetworkAccessManager* netManager):\r\n        m_netManager(netManager){}\r\n\r\n    void send(QUrl const &amp;url){\r\n        QNetworkRequest request(url);\r\n        auto reply = m_netManager-&gt;get(request);\r\n        connect(reply, &amp;QNetworkReply::finished, [this, reply](){\r\n            // do some stuff with reply (like if url is redirected)\r\n            if(isRedirected(reply)){\r\n                // we have to delete the reply and send a new one\r\n                QUrl newUrl;\r\n                // somehow get the new url;\r\n                reply-&gt;deleteLater();\r\n                send(newUrl);\r\n            }\r\n            else{\r\n                reply-&gt;setParent(this); // so that it will be deleted when an instance of this class is deleted\r\n                emit completed(reply);\r\n            }\r\n        });\r\n    }\r\n\r\nsignals:\r\n    void completed(QNetworkReply* reply);\r\n\r\nprivate:\r\n    QNetworkAccessManager* m_netManager;\r\n    bool isRedirected(QNetworkReply * reply){\r\n        bool yes = false;\r\n\r\n        /* process the process reply and determine yes is true or false\r\n        ....\r\n        **/\r\n        return yes;\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use the class in this way:\r\n```\r\nauto req = new NetworkRequest(nm);\r\nreq-&gt;send(&quot;http://someurl.com&quot;);\r\nconnect(req, &amp;NetworkRequest::completed, randomClass, &amp;RandomClass::slot);\r\n\r\n// in RandomClass::slot I call NetworkRequest::deleteLater() when I finished with the network data\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this clearly involves some manual memory management and I have to be careful to not forget deleting the raw pointers. I was wondering if the code above could be written using `QSharedPointer`  (or even `std::shared_ptr`) and replacing:\r\n```\r\n        auto reply = m_netManager-&gt;get(request);\r\n```\r\nwith:\r\n```\r\n        auto smartReply = QSharedPointer&lt;QNetworkReply&gt;(m_netManager-&gt;get(request));\r\n```\r\nthen replace all instances of `reply` with `smartReply.get()` and then forget about manually deleting reply objects. However, it is unclear to me if the shared pointer will automatically  delete the objects because between the time frame that I call `send()` and the signal `QNetworkReply::finished`, would the smart pointer know that the raw pointer is still in use? Also when I delete an instance of `NetworkRequest` will the shared pointer automatically delete the `QNetworkReply` it owns?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200997/smart-pointers-and-avoid-manual-memory-management-when-using-qnetworkaccessmanag","title":"Smart pointers and avoid manual memory management when using QNetworkAccessManager"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":17531,"user_id":402037,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8fc3b3667c918504550fd656ac50b87f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/402037/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017942,"post_id":58200996,"comment_id":102780185,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200996/conceptual-problem-in-pushing-an-object-in-an-array#comment102780185_58200996"},{"owner":{"reputation":12679,"user_id":2875348,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZYAH1.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ravibagul91","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2875348/ravibagul91"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019795,"post_id":58200996,"comment_id":102781186,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200996/conceptual-problem-in-pushing-an-object-in-an-array#comment102781186_58200996"},{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":11387990,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fEzsEntsFgY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABrg/uirzJeTivuk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hardik Aswal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11387990/hardik-aswal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570038360,"post_id":58200996,"comment_id":102791444,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200996/conceptual-problem-in-pushing-an-object-in-an-array#comment102791444_58200996"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":39,"user_id":11387990,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-fEzsEntsFgY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABrg/uirzJeTivuk/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Hardik Aswal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11387990/hardik-aswal"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570018668,"post_id":58201119,"comment_id":102780583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200996/conceptual-problem-in-pushing-an-object-in-an-array/58201119#comment102780583_58201119"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":10333865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0e3fe2913ea623d345c2c3f436d49ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Iqbal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10333865/iqbal"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570017775,"creation_date":1570017775,"answer_id":58201119,"question_id":58200996,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201119","body_markdown":"You are setting the state the wrong way.. you should set the state in a callback function. \r\n```\r\nconst newProduct ={...};\r\nthis.setstate(st =&gt;

Consider instead using higher order mapping operators.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n\r\n      selectedProductSuppliers$ = this.selectedProduct$\r\n        .pipe(\r\n          filter(selectedProduct =&gt; Boolean(selectedProduct)),\r\n          switchMap(selectedProduct =&gt;\r\n            forkJoin(selectedProduct.supplierIds.map(supplierId =&gt; this.http.get&lt;Supplier&gt;(`${this.suppliersUrl}/${supplierId}`)))\r\n          )\r\n        );\r\n\r\nWhen the first Observable (this.selectedProduct$) emits, it filters out any nulls (no product was selected). Then it uses switchMap (a higher-order mapping operator) to handle the inner subscription.\r\n\r\nSo your code would look something more like this:\r\n\r\n    getUsersDataObs().pipe(\r\n       switchMap(data =&gt; sendMailObs(data))\r\n    )\r\n    .subscribe()\r\n\r\nI have a stackblitz example that gets a user and then gets the user&#39;s todos here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-todos-deborahk-switchmap\r\n\r\n    this.todosForUser$ = this.http.get&lt;User[]&gt;(url)\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        switchMap(user =&gt;\r\n          this.http.get&lt;ToDo[]&gt;(`${this.todoUrl}?userId=${this.currentUserId}`)\r\n        )\r\n      );","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200988/fire-and-forget-in-an-observable-chain-with-rxjs/58209571#58209571","title":"Fire and forget in an Observable chain with RxJS"}],"owner":{"reputation":6418,"user_id":5699993,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5428464065272667ef39b9415d8e8722?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Picci","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5699993/picci"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58202650,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570051872,"creation_date":1570017270,"question_id":58200988,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200988","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s say I have 2 functions which return an Observable each\r\n\r\n - `getUsersDataObs()`: the returned Observable calls an http endpoint to get some data related to the user of the app, this Observable emits when the data is received \r\n - `sendMailObs`: the returned Observable calls a mail server to send an email, this Observable emits when the mail server responds with an acknowledgment\r\n\r\nI need the user data to create the mail, so I need to call first `getUsersDataObs` and then `sendMailObs`.

issue is the condition\r\n\r\n&gt;```py\r\n&gt;if (ballX &gt;= mouseX or ballX &lt;= mouseX) and (ballX + ballSize &lt;= mouseX + PaddleW/2 and ballX + ballSize &gt;= mouseX - PaddleW/2):\r\n&gt;```\r\n\r\nThe result of the 1st condition (`(ballX &gt;= mouseX or ballX &lt;= mouseX) `) is always `True` and the 2nd condition is screwed up.\r\n\r\nIf you have a range for `x1` to `x1+w1` and a 2nd range from `x2` to `x2+w2`, then the 2 ranges are overlapping if\r\n\r\n```py\r\nx1 &lt;= x2+w and x2 &lt;= x1+w1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nSo the collisiton test has to be:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif ballY &lt;= PaddleY + PaddleH and PaddleY &lt;= ballY + ballSize:\r\n    if ballX &lt;= mouseX + PaddleW/2 and mouseX - PaddleW/2 &lt;= ballX + ballSize:\r\n        ballMoveY = -ballMoveY\r\n        score += 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway I recommend to use [`pygame.Rect`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html) objects and the method [`.colliderect()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/rect.html#pygame.Rect.colliderect). e.g:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nball_rect   = pygame.Rect(ballX, ballY, ballSize, ballSize)\r\npaddle_rect = pygame.Rect(mouseX-PaddleW/2, PaddleY, PaddleW, PaddleH)\r\nif ball_rect.colliderect(paddle_rect):\r\n    ballMoveY = -ballMoveY\r\n    score += 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSince your objects are [`Sprites`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Sprite), I recommend to to keep the `.rect` attribute up to date.e.g:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Ball(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\r\n    # [...]\r\n\r\n    def move(self, x, y):\r\n        self.rect.topleft = (x, y)\r\n        self.posx, self.posy = self.rect.topleft\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\nclass Paddle(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\r\n    # [...]\r\n\r\n    def move(self, x):\r\n        self.rect.centerx = x\r\n        self.posx = self.rect.left\r\n ``` \r\n\r\n Now you can use the `.rect` attributes of the objects for the collision test:\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif ball.rect.colliderect(player.rect):\r\n    ballMoveY = -ballMoveY\r\n    score += 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince both objects are sprites it is rcommend tor use [`pygame.sprite.collide_rect()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.collide_rect):\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif pygame.sprite.collide_rect(ball, player):\r\n    ballMoveY = -ballMoveY\r\n    score += 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNote, a collision of a `Sprite` object and a [`Group`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.Group) or event 2 `Group`s can be found by [`pygame.sprite.spritecollide()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.spritecollide) respectively [`pygame.sprite.groupcollide()`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/sprite.html#pygame.sprite.groupcollide). e.g.:\r\n\r\n``` py\r\nblocks = pygame.sprite.Group()\r\nblocks.add(block.Block(10,block1Y,blockW, blockH, blockColor))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\nif pygame.sprite.spritecollide(ball, blocks, False):\r\n    ballMoveY = -ballMoveY\r\n    score += 10\r\n```\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfor block in blocks:\r\n    block.draw(Display)\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200974/pygame-spritecollide-giving-me-iterable-error/58206590#58206590","title":"Pygame spritecollide giving me iterable

The model takes (large) images for classification in standard numpy formatting.\r\n\r\nIt seems, I&#39;m hitting a HTTP request size limit on the server side. Requests to the model succeeds with PNG images of a size in the 8-9mb range and fails with images of the 15mb+ size. Specifically, it fails with 413 Request Entity Too Large.\r\n\r\nI assume, the limit is set in Nginx in the Docker image being build, as part of the deployment process. My question: *Given that the issue is due to the HTTP request size limit, is there any way to increase this limit in the azureml API?*\r\n\r\n**Deployment process**\r\n\r\nThe deployment process succeeds as expected.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom azureml.core import Workspace\r\nfrom azureml.core.model import InferenceConfig, Model\r\nfrom azureml.core.webservice import AciWebservice, Webservice\r\nfrom azureml.exceptions import WebserviceException\r\nfrom pathlib import Path\r\n\r\nPATH = Path(&#39;/data/home/azureuser/my_project&#39;)\r\n\r\nws = Workspace.from_config()\r\nmodel = ws.models[&#39;my_pytorch_model&#39;]\r\n\r\ninference_config = InferenceConfig(source_directory=PATH/&#39;src&#39;,\r\n                                   runtime=&#39;python&#39;,\r\n                                   entry_script=&#39;deployment/scoring/scoring.py&#39;,\r\n                                   conda_file=&#39;deployment/environment/env.yml&#39;)\r\n\r\ndeployment_config = AciWebservice.deploy_configuration(cpu_cores=2, memory_gb=4)\r\naci_service_name = &#39;azure-model&#39;\r\n\r\ntry:\r\n    service = Webservice(ws, name=aci_service_name)\r\n    if service:\r\n        service.delete()\r\nexcept WebserviceException as e:\r\n    print()\r\n\r\nservice = Model.deploy(ws, aci_service_name, [model], inference_config, deployment_config)\r\n\r\nservice.wait_for_deployment(True)\r\nprint(service.state)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Testing via `requests`**\r\n\r\nA simple test using requests:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport os\r\nimport json\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nimport requests\r\nfrom PIL import Image as PilImage\r\n\r\ntest_data = np.array(PilImage.open(PATH/&#39;src/deployment/test/test_image.png&#39;)).tolist()\r\ntest_sample = json.dumps({&#39;raw_data&#39;: \r\n    test_data\r\n})\r\ntest_sample_encoded = bytes(test_sample, encoding=&#39;utf8&#39;)\r\n\r\nheaders = {\r\n    &#39;Content-Type&#39;: &#39;application/json&#39;\r\n}\r\n\r\nresponse = requests.post(\r\n    service.scoring_uri,\r\n    data=test_sample_encoded,\r\n    headers=headers,\r\n    verify=True,\r\n    timeout=10\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nProduces the following error in `requests` for larger files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nConnectionError: (&#39;Connection aborted.&#39;, BrokenPipeError(32, &#39;Broken pipe&#39;))\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I guess is a known error in requests, when a connection is closed from the server before data upload is completed.\r\n\r\n**Testing via `pycurl`**\r\n\r\nUsing the curl wrapper, I get a more interpretable response.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pycurl\r\nfrom io import BytesIO\r\n\r\nc = pycurl.Curl()\r\nb = BytesIO()\r\n\r\nc.setopt(c.URL, service.scoring_uri)\r\nc.setopt(c.POST, True)\r\nc.setopt(c.HTTPHEADER,[&#39;Content-Type: application/json&#39;])\r\nc.setopt(pycurl.WRITEFUNCTION, b.write)\r\nc.setopt(c.POSTFIELDS, test_sample)\r\nc.setopt(c.VERBOSE, True)\r\nc.perform()\r\n\r\nout = b.getvalue()\r\n\r\nb.close()\r\nc.close()\r\n\r\nprint(out)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor large files, this yields the following error:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n&lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;title&gt;\r\n            413 Request Entity Too Large\r\n        &lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body bgcolor=&quot;white&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;center&gt;\r\n            &lt;h1&gt;\r\n                413 Request Entity Too Large\r\n            &lt;/h1&gt;\r\n        &lt;/center&gt;\r\n        &lt;hr&gt;\r\n        &lt;center&gt;\r\n                nginx/1.10.3 (Ubuntu)\r\n        &lt;/center&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n&lt;/html&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nLeading me to believe this is an issue in the Nginx configuration. Specifically, I guess that client_max_body_size is set to 10mb.\r\n\r\n**Question summarised**\r\n\r\nGiven that I am indeed hitting an issue with the Nginx configuration, can I change it somehow? If not using the Azure Machine Learning Service SDK, then maybe by overwriting the `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` file?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200953/post-request-fails-with-large-data-send-to-model-deployed-on-azure-container","title":"POST request fails with large data send to model deployed on Azure Container"},{"tags":["java","spring-boot","aop","spring-aop","spring-annotations"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37,"user_id":8099293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88f5b5aa861b40b85339bfb5326df241?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theNoobProgrammer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8099293/thenoobprogrammer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017789,"post_id":58201008,"comment_id":102780103,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200952/aop-pointcut-is-only-working-for-methods-which-are-annotated/58201008#comment102780103_58201008"},{"owner":{"reputation":644,"user_id":6499760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/712011925568089/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alexey  Usharovski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6499760/alexey-usharovski"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":37,"user_id":8099293,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/88f5b5aa861b40b85339bfb5326df241?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"theNoobProgrammer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8099293/thenoobprogrammer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570018999,"post_id":58201008,"comment_id":102780775,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200952/aop-pointcut-is-only-working-for-methods-which-are-annotated/58201008#comment102780775_58201008"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":644,"user_id":6499760,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/712011925568089/picture?type=large","display_name":"Alexey  Usharovski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6499760/alexey-usharovski"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570017377,"creation_date":1570017377,"answer_id":58201008,"question_id":58200952,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201008","body_markdown":"Spring AOP is working only for Spring beans (Spring beans could be created also by annotating the class).

Shouldn’t make any further difference behind what HTTP/2 did. It closes one edge-case of that (lost packets can make HTTP/2 slower on HTTP/2 than HTTP/1.1) and also potentially brings some performance improvements to the initial connection setup. If not move to, or optimised for, HTTP/2 then may wish to consider that in preparation. Priorities are also due to get a rethink in HTTP/3 but not decided how yet. At the end of the day it’s a transport layer change and the basic semantics of HTTP/2 doesn’t change so to higher level apps it should be fairly seamless - like HTTP/2 was.\n\n2. It’s UDP based (with fallback to TCP-based HTTP/2 and/or HTTP/1.1) which will be fun to enable and setup! Also [TLS libraries need to change to support it][1] so could be a while before we see it in some servers. CDNs are already leading the way and will be easiest way of getting this. Like HTTP/2, it’s probably most important to have it on your edge server and then down grade to HTTP/2 or even HTTP/1.1 for internal traffic beyond that. It’s also more fully encrypted which will make it difficult to sniff and reroute traffic as less information is readable to middle boxes than was in TCP.\n\n3. See answer 2 above which will make it more difficult to sniff traffic. Also it’s **very new** (not even fully finished and approved at this time of writing) so there may be implementation bugs like there were for HTTP/2 ([for example][2]), and some products will not support it initially. On plus side it’s only available over HTTPS which is good for security.\n\n\n  [1]: https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/01/21/quic-and-missing-apis/\n  [2]: https://blog.cloudflare.com/on-the-recent-http-2-dos-attacks/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200951/http-3-and-its-impact/58209064#58209064","title":"HTTP/3 and its impact"}],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":2332632,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5f5a7d69ffd1c11d4c99d43d16357f7b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Yogesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2332632/yogesh"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":68,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58209064,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570081334,"creation_date":1570017118,"question_id":58200951,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200951","body_markdown":"Recently Chrome, Firefox, cURL etc announced their support for HTTP/3 ( it was earlier termed as HTTP-over-QUIC ). \r\n\r\nHow do you see its adaptation impact from perspective of changes in - \r\n\r\n1) Applications (web-based, mobile, pure socket based etc )\r\n\r\n2) Hosting infrastructures ( web/app servers, firewalls, loadbalancers, CDNs, router, switches etc ) &amp; ISPs etc.\r\n\r\n3) Security ( new threats, vulnerabilities, landscape of VAPT tools etc etc )","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200951/http-3-and-its-impact","title":"HTTP/3 and its impact"},{"tags":["cassandra","janusgraph","scylla"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1075,"user_id":6114888,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208661162904754/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jim Wartnick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6114888/jim-wartnick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1075,"user_id":6114888,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":43,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208661162904754/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jim Wartnick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6114888/jim-wartnick"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570018938,"last_edit_date":1570018938,"creation_date":1570018577,"answer_id":58201337,"question_id":58200949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201337","body_markdown":"Cassandra can be backed up a few ways. One way is called a &quot;snapshot&quot;. You can issue this via &quot;nodetool snapshot&quot; command. What cassandra will do is to create a &quot;snapshots&quot; sub-directory, if it doesn&#39;t already exist, under each table that&#39;s being &quot;backed up&quot; (each table has its own directory where it stores its data) and then it will create the specific snapshot directory for this particular occurrence of the snapshot (either you can name the directory with the &quot;nodetool snapshot&quot; parameter or let it default). Cassandra will then create soft links to all of the sstables that exist for that particular table - looping through each table, keyspace or database - depending on your &quot;nodetool snapshot&quot; parameters. It&#39;s very fast as creating soft links takes almost 0 time. You will have to perform this command on each node in the cassandra cluster to back up all of the data. Each node&#39;s data will be backed up to the local host. I know DSE, and possibly Apache, are adding functionality to back up to object storage as well (I don&#39;t know if this is an OpsCenter-only capability or if it can be done via the snapshot command as well). You will have to watch the space consumption on this as there are no processes to clean these up.\r\n\r\nLike many database systems, you can also purchase/use 3rd party software to perform backups (e.g. Cohesity (formally Talena), Rubrik, etc.).  We use one such product in our environments and it works well (graphical interface, easy-to-use point-in-time recoveryt, etc.). They also offer easy-to-use &quot;refresh&quot; capabilities (e.g. refresh your PT environment from, say, production backups).\r\n\r\nThose are probably the two best options.\r\n\r\nGood luck.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200949/how-to-perform-backup-and-restore-of-janusgraph-database-which-is-backed-by-apac/58201337#58201337","title":"How to perform backup and restore of Janusgraph database which is backed by Apache Cassandra?"}],"owner":{"reputation":93,"user_id":3648106,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04ee37f3d65c50b30e6639c5793403f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shr4N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3648106/shr4n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":93,"user_id":3648106,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/04ee37f3d65c50b30e6639c5793403f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Shr4N","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3648106/shr4n"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570018938,"creation_date":1570017114,"last_edit_date":1570017664,"question_id":58200949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200949","body_markdown":"I&#39;m having trouble in figuring out on how to take the backup of **Janusgraph database** which is backed by persistent storage **Apache Cassandra**.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m looking for correct methodology on how to perform **backup** and **restore** tasks.

I have an application which writes to a folder structure underneath the CommonAppFolder (set as C:\\ProgramData).  NLog is configured to generate a new log file each day.  The intention is that the logfile be machine specific.  Multiple OS users can login to the machine and all activity relevant to the application will get written to the daily log file dependent on the specified logging level in Nlog.Config.\r\n\r\nWhen run on my development machine to which I have Admin access the application successfully writes to the log file as intended for multiple application users.  However when we deploy the application to the VM, it appears that Admin users who run the application successfully write to the log file, but non-admin user activity is not logged.  Curiously the applicaiton does not fail, its just that the user application activity is not logged, or if it is being logged elsewhere we have so far not been able to locate it.\r\n\r\nThe ProgramData folder is what is delivered to me when I query the CommonAppData folder environment variable from within Visual Studio, specifically C:\\ProgramData.  I then use this in the Install pack which is built using WIX to construct the application folder structure beneath this in the following form:\r\n\r\n     C:\\programData\\Customer Name\\Application Name\\Config\r\n     C:\\programData\\Customer Name\\Application Name\\Logs\r\n\r\nThe Config folder holds the Nlog.Config file, I hold the nlog config here in order to allow the config folder to be writable.  I hold an incremental number (LogId) for identifying log entries.  This is a workaround to overcome restrictions of our corporate desktop model which does not allow the application to write the Program Files folder.\r\n\r\n\r\nKind Regards\r\nPaul J.\r\n

Be sure that the specific dependencies for puppeteer are all installed on the linux server. They won&#39;t always install with npm i. the command to check for dependencies not installed: \r\n`ldd chrome | grep not` \r\nand you might find this useful for installing them all at once: \r\n``` \r\nsudo apt-get install gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils wget \r\n```\r\nAgain, yours may be slightly different since you&#39;re running a different system, but definitely be sure your dependencies are installed with whatever the equivalent procedure for your system is. \r\n\r\n2. If that&#39;s all good, you will want to check the portion of your code that looks like this: \r\n`await page.goto(&#39;https://google.com&#39;, {waitUntil: &#39;networkidle2&#39;});` and be sure that the waitUntil value is waiting for networkidle2. Check the docs on this value. \r\n\r\n3. You can also run puppeteer in slowMo to get a better idea of what&#39;s happening. This option will delay the operations by a specified number of milliseconds.  \r\n``` \r\nconst browser = await puppeteer.launch({\r\n   headless: false,\r\n   slowMo: 250 // slow down by 250ms\r\n }); ```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200940/puppeteer-page-javascript-wont-load-when-running-on-linux-server/58203322#58203322","title":"Puppeteer page javascript won&#39;t load when running on linux server"}],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":10333865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0e3fe2913ea623d345c2c3f436d49ee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Iqbal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10333865/iqbal"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570025625,"creation_date":1570017080,"question_id":58200940,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58200940","body_markdown":"I am making a script in javascript to scrape product information from a particular website.

Normaly when you open the site you have keep scrolling down untill all products are loaded on the page. for that I&#39;m using the following code:\r\n```\r\n    await page.evaluate(async () =&gt; {\r\n      await new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n        let totalHeight = 0;\r\n        const distance = 100;\r\n        const timer = setInterval(() =&gt; {\r\n          const scrollHeight = document.body.scrollHeight;\r\n          window.scrollBy(0, distance);\r\n          totalHeight += distance;\r\n          if (totalHeight &gt;= scrollHeight) {\r\n            clearInterval(timer);\r\n            resolve();\r\n          }\r\n        }, 300);\r\n      });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow this works like a charm on my local computer having Windows 10.

There are many jobs, each job class is annotated with `@DisallowConcurrentExecution`. We have a problem - sometimes 2 jobs (instances of one job class) run simultaneously, but they shouldn&#39;t.\r\n\r\nInstances are running with Spring boot, and for the intervals setting `@Cron` annotation on beans is used. A job may work 1-2 hours, the interval between job calls is also around 1-2 hours, hence there is high probability that a new job instance might be called before a previous instance is finished. Sometimes it happens: on the other scheduler a new job instance is started, while previous job instance on different scheduler has not finished yet. \r\nI couldn&#39;t reproduce this problem, I tried on my machine running 2 instances of application with test database using the same quartz config, and with the job that takes 1 hour to finish, and calling interval set to 10 seconds, everything works fine. I managed to reproduce the problem only when I set the Quartz property `isClustered` to `false`.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur job configurations:\r\n```\r\n@Bean\r\n@CronTrigger(\r\n    cronExpression = &quot;0 0 0/2 ? * *&quot;,\r\n    description = &quot;Update category stats from indexer&quot;\r\n)\r\npublic UpdateStatsJob updateStatsJob(){\r\n    return new UpdateStatsJob(...);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOur Quartz properties:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# main\r\norg.quartz.scheduler.instanceName=QuartzScheduler\r\norg.quartz.scheduler.instanceId=AUTO\r\norg.quartz.scheduler.skipUpdateCheck=true\r\n\r\n# storage\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.class=org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.JobStoreTX\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.driverDelegateClass = org.quartz.impl.jdbcjobstore.PostgreSQLDelegate\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.dataSource=abc\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.tablePrefix=abc.qrtz_\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.useProperties=true\r\norg.quartz.jobStore.isClustered=true\r\n\r\n# jdbc\r\norg.quartz.dataSource.abc.driver=${project.db.driver.class.name}\r\n....\r\n\r\n# threads\r\norg.quartz.threadPool.class=org.quartz.simpl.SimpleThreadPool\r\norg.quartz.threadPool.threadCount=10\r\norg.quartz.threadPool.threadNamePrefix=ProjectJobThread\r\n```\r\n\r\nConcurrent execution of these jobs leads to racing conditions, making the jobs crash.\r\n\r\nAre there any setups or properties that may produce this behavior?\r\n\r\nMaybe it depends on &quot;if the Quartz doesn&#39;t know for sure whether that the job execution is hung on another machine and it should be restarted&quot;

It has been created\r\n&gt; to make possible construction of any lists with XML layouts as an item\r\n&gt; which can be customized vastly while improving on the efficiency of\r\n&gt; ListViews and GridViews.

I wrote a custom adapter to add CardViews to my ListView:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class CardAdapter extends BaseAdapter {\r\n\r\n    private final ArrayList&lt;CardView&gt; cards = new ArrayList&lt;CardView&gt;();\r\n    private Context context;\r\n\r\n    public CardAdapter( Context context ) {\r\n        this.context = context;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public void add( CardView view ) {\r\n        cards.add( view );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getCount() {\r\n        return cards.size();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getViewTypeCount() {\r\n        return getCount();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public int getItemViewType(int position) {\r\n        return position;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public Object getItem(int i) {\r\n        if( i &gt;= cards.size() || i &lt; 0 )\r\n            return null;\r\n        return cards.get( i );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public long getItemId(int i) {\r\n        return cards.get(i).getId();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    public View getView(int position, View view, ViewGroup viewGroup) {\r\n        if( view == null ) {\r\n            view = (CardView) getItem( position );\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return view;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe MainActivity is something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {\r\n\r\n    @Override\r\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\r\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\r\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\r\n\r\n        ListView list = findViewById(R.id.notesList);\r\n        CardAdapter adapter = new CardAdapter(getBaseContext());\r\n        adapter.add( makeCard() );\r\n        // repeat making cards however many times...\r\n        list.setAdapter(adapter);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private CardView makeCard() {\r\n        CardView card = new CardView(this);\r\n        // Do some things to customize the CardView\r\n        return card;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow it seems like Android is trying to recycle the views, but is doing a lousy job of it. Initially the page looks fine, but as soon as I begin scrolling, the cards start to move all over the screen, the spacing changes, the cards begin to overlap, etc. [![This is what the ListView looks like before scrolling][1]][1] [![and this is what it looks like after scrolling][2]][2].\r\n\r\nNote that I only scrolled for a couple seconds, this was not a gradual change, the cards were kind of &#39;jumping&#39; around the screen. The only solution I have come up with so far is changing my `getView` to be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    @Override\r\n    public View getView(int position, View view, ViewGroup viewGroup) {\r\n        return (CardView) getItem(position);\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this works, but even loading ~10 items is very slow, and the scrolling lags.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/8kbAr.png\r\n

few points:\r\n\r\n1. If you want to get updates even when the beacon stays present, you must use ranging APIs in addition to RegionBootstrap.  Start ranging by calling `startRangingBeaconsInRegion(...)` in the `didDetermineStateForRegion` callback.\r\n\r\n2. You should not put any background code in an Activity class as Android may kill the Activity if not visible.  The simplest place to put this code is in the custom Application class where you use RegionBootastrap (or in a custom class that is initialized and accessed from the custom Application class).\r\n\r\nYou also likely to need a foreground service to keep your app running more than 10 minutes in the background on Android 8+.  The library makes it easy to add this without programming a foreground service of your own.  See the library docs here: https://altbeacon.github.io/android-beacon-library/foreground-service.html\r\n\r\nIf you see detections stop in the background after a period of time on Android 7+ (causing a region exit event), you may need to add code to force long period background scanning: https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/pull/529\r\n\r\nFinally, be careful of custom app killers on Chinese OEMs which may make it impossible to satisfy your requirements on phones made by these manufacturers.

Does the RegionBootstrap suits in this case?\r\n\r\nRight now, the didEnterRegion is triggered once and after 30~ seconds the onExitRegion is triggered, even though the BLE beacon is transmitting which is confusing for me.\r\n\r\n2)if synchronizeBleWithTheApp() which is inside the custom Application class uses code in an Activity MainActivity class, does it mean I need the app to open that MainActivity? can I still trigger the synchronization in the background?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200879/using-beacons-to-synchronise-an-android-app-and-a-ble-in-the-background","title":"Using Beacons to synchronise an Android app and a BLE in the background"},{"tags":["laravel","storage","filepath","ziparchive","laravel-storage"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11916702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce5cf0ccced78d630f1926fe113c144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Commander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11916702/commander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570017598,"post_id":58201013,"comment_id":102779987,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200875/how-to-set-a-dynamic-path-for-ziparchive-addfile/58201013#comment102779987_58201013"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10048590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MRTVzhhuoDg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/UiCahGXTxmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"PHPanchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10048590/phpanchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11916702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce5cf0ccced78d630f1926fe113c144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Commander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11916702/commander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570018411,"post_id":58201013,"comment_id":102780439,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200875/how-to-set-a-dynamic-path-for-ziparchive-addfile/58201013#comment102780439_58201013"},{"owner":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11916702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce5cf0ccced78d630f1926fe113c144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Commander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11916702/commander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019151,"post_id":58201013,"comment_id":102780855,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200875/how-to-set-a-dynamic-path-for-ziparchive-addfile/58201013#comment102780855_58201013"},{"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10048590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MRTVzhhuoDg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/UiCahGXTxmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"PHPanchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10048590/phpanchal"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":66,"user_id":11916702,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4ce5cf0ccced78d630f1926fe113c144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Commander","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11916702/commander"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570019950,"post_id":58201013,"comment_id":102781265,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200875/how-to-set-a-dynamic-path-for-ziparchive-addfile/58201013#comment102781265_58201013"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10048590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MRTVzhhuoDg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/UiCahGXTxmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"PHPanchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10048590/phpanchal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":9,"user_id":10048590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-MRTVzhhuoDg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAACY/UiCahGXTxmg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"PHPanchal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10048590/phpanchal"},"comment_count":4,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570017861,"last_edit_date":1570017861,"creation_date":1570017396,"answer_id":58201013,"question_id":58200875,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58201013","body_markdown":"- Using the below link setup Zipper package into your laravel project.\r\n  \r\n  https://github.com/Chumper/Zipper\r\n\r\n- after completion of Zipper package setup use the below code into your respected controller.\r\n\r\n    $files = glob($image_dir_media . $file_new_name);\r\n\r\n    $date = new DateTime();\r\n\r\n    $zip = $date-&gt;format(&#39;Y-m-d&#39;) . &#39;_invoices.zip&#39;;\r\n\r\n    \\Zipper::make(public_path() . &#39;/media/&#39;

want something like Modify-Migration after changing something inside the `Migration.cs` file. \r\n\r\n**Already Tried**\r\n\r\nThere are some when I accidentally use the **Annotation** but now I want to **remove that**.  \r\nI have tried to remove  this line:\r\n`.Annotation(&quot;SqlServer:ValueGenerationStrategy&quot;,SqlServerValueGenerationStrategy.IdentityColumn),` from here\r\n\r\n```CSharp\r\nmigrationBuilder.CreateTable(\r\n    name: &quot;LateFine&quot;,\r\n    columns: table =&gt; new\r\n    {\r\n        StudentId = table.Column&lt;int&gt;(nullable: false)\r\n

of my table will look like this:\r\n\r\n`Identity Specification: No`\r\n\r\nI already know that, using `DatabaseGenerated(DatabaseGeneratedOption.None)` will not produce that annotation in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was the previous code\r\n\r\n```C#\r\nclass LateFine\r\n{\r\n    [Key]\r\n    public int StudentId { get; set; }\r\n    public int FineAmount { get; set;

Catch the ERROR (either in WAL or &quot;logical replication worker&quot;)\r\n\r\n2. Find a way to execute some code at &quot;logical replication worker&quot; startup\r\n\r\n3. Use a CRON (at application level, so not native to PSQL) to check if the server is offline (pulsation). If so, then execute the above command manually. Note that this solution may work but I would like to avoid it because there will still be some errors raised if the connexion is lost between two &quot;ticks&quot; of the CRON\r\n\r\nThank you very much for your help, cheers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58200834/how-to-disable-subscription-automatically-on-connexion-lost-postgresql-logical","title":"How to disable subscription automatically on connexion lost (PostgreSQL Logical Replication)?"},{"tags":["python","pytorch"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":143,"user_id":6624101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/18d69f24d2ce2333143778f1c61afa9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hui-Po Wang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6624101/hui-po-wang"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570027020,"creation_date":1570027020,"answer_id":58203778,"question_id":58200833,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58203778","body_markdown":"Yes, it will be correct. \r\n\r\nIf you are not using in-place operations, the gradients will be computed correctly.
