That way, even when your app is closed, your receiver receives `PHONE_STATE` events and can fire off your logic.\r\n\r\n    &lt;receiver\r\n        android:name=&quot;.CallBarring&quot;\r\n        android:exported=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;intent-filter&gt;\r\n            &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE&quot; /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/intent-filter&gt;\r\n    &lt;/receiver&gt;\r\n\r\ndocs: [manifest declared receivers][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.android.com/guide/components/broadcasts#manifest-declared-receivers","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486282/broadcast-receiver-not-working-when-closed-app/58507581#58507581","title":"Broadcast receiver not working when closed app"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12070884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/771b7ff1a303bffa89a7f8093c678b64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Selena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12070884/selena"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12070884,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/771b7ff1a303bffa89a7f8093c678b64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Selena","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12070884/selena"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571757890,"creation_date":1571660778,"last_edit_date":1571663269,"question_id":58486282,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486282","body_markdown":"When the incoming call to the phone popup on the screen.

Images converted to base64string have huge RAM footprint in large object heap\r\n\r\nYes, that is obviously true. All images are huge. Compression methods only apply to storage and transfer. But when the Image is loaded into memory - for display or further processing - all compression steps **have** to be undone. This is a common pitfall of people working with them.\r\n\r\n&gt;It then converts them to a Base64 string to upload them into our hosting environment via rest. The environment requires it be done this way, i cannot use URLS. When I do this, they get stored on the large object heap and the program&#39;s RAM usage skyrockets over time.&quot;\r\nBase64 is ineffective, but will not add a lot to this. +25% IIRC.\r\n\r\nThe big questions if you are **really** seeing an issue here, or are only misreading the memory footprint? @CodeCaster figured out that you kept a reference (wich is a real problem and one of the few ways you can get a memory leak in .NET at all), but even if you loose those this string will still stay in memory for some time.\r\n\r\n.NET uses the GarbageCollection Memory Management approach. That approach has one issue: While the GC collects, all other Threads accessing the same managed area have to be paused. As a result the GC is - for lack of a better term - very *lazy* with running. If it only runs once on application closure, that is the ideal situation. The only things that can get it to run earlier are:\r\n\r\n- calls to `GC.Collect();` which should generally not be used in productive code, only for debugging if you got a reference memory leak\r\n- the danger of a OOM Expection\r\n- some of the alternative GC modes, particular stuff like the server one\r\n\r\nAll I can tell you that it will run *eventually*. But I do not think you need to know the exact time necessarily.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486276/memory-usage-and-manipulating-images/58486473#58486473","title":"Memory usage and manipulating images"}],"owner":{"reputation":1261,"user_id":1649043,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4f062d8374c0a164f1edcb4dca7e0d5e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CarComp","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1649043/carcomp"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58486473,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571662359,"creation_date":1571660755,"question_id":58486276,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486276","body_markdown":"TL;DR; Images converted to base64string have huge RAM footprint in large object heap.\r\n\r\nI have some code in a windows service that consumes our product images uploaded by users, standardizes them into a web-grade format (they will upload 10MB bitmaps), and does some other things like resize them into a square and add whitespace padding.\r\n\r\nIt then converts them to a base64 string to upload them into our hosting environment via rest.

VPC DNS issue**\r\n\r\nRegardless of the issue of `OpenVPN` DNS forwarding to the client, we wanted to use the VPC DNS manually, I mean setting it ourselves in the configuration file `/etc/resolv.conf` as follows:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nnameserver &lt;VPC DNS&gt;\r\n&lt;default interface&gt;\r\n```` \r\n\r\nWe tried to set the DNS associated with our VPC which is represented by the field `IPv4 CIDR` and let&#39;s consider it as `10.0.0.0`. Trying with this DNS couldn&#39;t work as we assign an invalid DNS. After a bit more investigation, we found that aThe DNS server provided in the VPC environment is the base of the VPC network range plus 2, so this way it will be =&gt; `10.0.0.2`, or we can use a generic one `169.254.169.253`.\r\n\r\n**Just a reminder**\r\n\r\n-------------------\r\n &gt; (0 to 255 inclusive), of which one is the network address (.0) and the other is the network broadcast address (.255).\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThis way, if we check if our client recognizes the DNS, we run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvagrant@manager:~$ nslookup 172.*.*.2\r\n2.0.31.172.in-addr.arpa name = ip-172-*-*-2.us-east-2.compute.internal.\r\n\r\nAuthoritative answers can be found from:\r\n\r\nvagrant@manager:~$ \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also run `dig` for the API Endpoint hostname to check the returned IPs. In this case, it should return 3 IPs, 1 for each subnet we associated with the endpoint.\r\n```\r\nvagrant@manager:~$ dig pwcc7wokgi.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\r\n\r\n; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.11.3-1ubuntu1.9-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; pwcc7wokgi.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com        \r\n;; global options: +cmd\r\n;; Got answer:\r\n;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 17511\r\n;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1\r\n\r\n;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:\r\n; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096;; QUESTION SECTION:\r\n;pwcc7wokgi.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com.

Forwarding DNS to OpenVPN client**\r\n\r\nTo do so we have to add the following lines in the server configuration file.\r\n```\r\npush &quot;redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp&quot;\r\npush &quot;dhcp-option DNS 169.254.169.253&quot;\r\npush &quot;dhcp-option DNS 172.*.*.2&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first line it&#39;s necessary not only in the case of DNS forwarding but to redirect all the traffic coming from the agent to go through the server.\r\n\r\nThe lines with `dhcp-option DNS` correspond to the DNSs we want to add to the client, 1 of them would be sufficient.\r\n\r\n**2.1 Issues**\r\n\r\nWe faced some issues when the client could not get updated by the server or by the client itself. the DNS config. file `/etc/resolv.conf` got overwritten always by the default value:\r\n``` \r\nnameserver 127.0.0.53\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is not our case. after some debugging we found that:\r\n\r\n1.  **We didn&#39;t have `resolveconf` library installed as it&#39;s essential for `OpenVPN` when forwarding DNSs.** `OpenVPN` uses two configuration file which uses the script `/sbin/resolveconf` to override the file `/etc/resolv.conf` when connecting or disconnecting from the VPN if needed.\r\n\r\nIn the client config. file\r\n```\r\nscript-security 2\r\nup /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\r\ndown /etc/openvpn/update-resolv-conf\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. **`dnsmasq` also could override `/etc/resolv.conf` by default values - `Not a fixed case`**\r\nIn our case, I needed to disable `dnsmasq` when connecting to the VPN so OpenVPN could not forward the DNSs as `/etc/resolv.conf` always overwritten it.\r\n\r\n3.  **It&#39;s recommended to restart `network-manager` if changes are made to `dnsmasq`.**\r\n\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n**Valid Log Message**\r\n```\r\nTue Oct 22 17:17:16 2019 PUSH: Received control message: &#39;PUSH_REPLY,redirect-gateway def1 bypass-dhcp,dhcp-option DNS 169.254.169.253,dhcp-option DNS 10.0.0.2,route 10.8.0.1,topology net30,ping 10,ping-restart 120,ifconfig 10.8.0.6 10.8.0.5,peer-id 0,cipher AES-256-GCM&#39;\r\n\r\ndhcp-option DNS 169.254.169.253\r\ndhcp-option DNS 10.0.0.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nRshad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486268/openvpn-is-not-resolving-http-s-requests-cant-reach-aws-private-api-gateways/58520223#58520223","title":"OpenVPN is not resolving HTTP/s requests - Can&#39;t reach AWS private API Gateway&#39;s endpoint when connected to an authorized VPN"}],"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":7611357,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/j97o7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Rshad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7611357/rshad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58520223,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571824657,"creation_date":1571660727,"question_id":58486268,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486268","body_markdown":"OpenVPN is not resolving HTTP/s correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nI created a private API gateway to which I want to access through a privated DNS configured in an `execute-api` Endpoint created in the same VPC as the API Gateway. \r\n\r\nI can reach it from other resources created in the same VPC.

Why lock 3 rows instead of 1?\r\n\r\nand the sql\r\n```\r\nupdate game_ticket set delete_time=null, is_deleted=0, update_time=&#39;2019-10-21 03:13:14.557&#39;,

somewhere while I checked because i don&#39;t have any UPDATE method look like this (not this long) &lt;br/&gt;\r\nI figured those two statement have the same **aws_match_id**, which is an index of table, is why DEADLOCK happens. &lt;br/&gt;\r\nAfter innodb retry the transaction the process went just fine, but I am very much like to solve the DEADLOCK problem. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\r\nIn code, this is where I update the only two TICKETs&#39; ranking whose aws_match_id is the same\r\n```\r\n    public List&lt;Ticket&gt; batchUpdateTicketRankingAndStatus(List&lt;Ticket&gt; tickets) {\r\n        if (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(tickets)) {\r\n            return tickets;\r\n        }\r\n        tickets.forEach(ticket -&gt; ticketRepository.updateTicketRankingAndStatusById(ticket.getId(),

I know you are supposed to link the header files for the compiler to create a .o file and then supply the library files to the linker so it can create the executable. The explanations i found about g++ syntax went a bit over my head so i was hoping for a concrete example of how to compile a .cpp file using external libraries. \r\n\r\n\r\nmain.cpp looks like this:\r\n\r\n    #include &quot;GLFW/glfw3.h&quot;\r\n    #include &lt;thread&gt;\r\n\r\n    int main() \r\n    { \r\n    glfwInit(); \r\n    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(1)); \r\n    glfwTerminate(); \r\n    }\r\n\r\nthe full path to glfw3.h is `C:\\C++\\glfw\\include\\GLFW\\glfw3.h`\r\n\r\nThe **compilers** .bat file looks like this:\r\n\r\n    @echo off\r\n    g++ -std=c++11^\r\n     -I\\C:\\C++\\glfw\\include\\^\r\n     -c main.cpp^\r\n     -o main.o\r\n    pause\r\n\r\n\r\nThe **linker** .bat file:\r\n\r\n    @echo off\r\n    g++ -L\\C:\\C++\\glfw\\lib-mingw\\libglfw3.a^\r\n     -L\\C:\\C++\\glfw\\lib-mingw\\libglfw3dll.a^\r\n     -c main.o^\r\n     -o main.exe\r\n    pause\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the compiler .bat to produce a main.o file which i can later use the linker to make a main.exe file, but instead i get the following error message: &lt;br/&gt;\r\n`main.cpp:1:24: fatal error: GLFW/glfw3.h: No such file or

I import this header page to other parts of my code.

I import this header page with my ID to a billion different places in the code, so It would be ideal to have the AJAX call be tied to this import, instead of going arround and copy pasting the ajax call to all the views in my website! Does anyone have any idea what Im doing wrong? Can I even use the `&lt;script&gt;` tag in imports?

Mike Walton has stated, the XML is incomplete (which prevents others from readily reproducing the NULLs that the OP is asking about). If we close the open XML elements, the issue with the NULL from the XMLGET is that &quot;clinical_study&quot; is the **root node**... XMLGET retrieves elements **within** the root node. In order to return the contents of the root node, you can use an expression of:\r\n\r\n```src_xml:&quot;$&quot; AS clinical_study_contents```\r\n\r\nHere is a simple test harness to demonstrate this, as well as a valid use of XMLGET (to extract the contents of the &quot;id_info&quot; element):\r\n```\r\nWITH STG_XML AS (\r\n  SELECT PARSE_XML($1) AS src_xml\r\n    FROM VALUES\r\n           ($$\r\n&lt;clinical_study&gt;\r\n &lt;!-- This xml conforms to an XML Schema at:\r\n  https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/html/images/info/public.xsd --&gt;\r\n &lt;required_header&gt;\r\n  &lt;download_date&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov processed this data on September 13, 2019&lt;/download_date&gt;\r\n  &lt;link_text&gt;Link to the current ClinicalTrials.gov record.&lt;/link_text&gt;\r\n  &lt;url&gt;https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00010010&lt;/url&gt;\r\n &lt;/required_header&gt;\r\n &lt;id_info&gt;\r\n  &lt;org_study_id&gt;CDR0000068431&lt;/org_study_id&gt;\r\n  &lt;secondary_id&gt;NYU-0004&lt;/secondary_id&gt;\r\n  &lt;secondary_id&gt;P-UPJOHN-NYU-0004&lt;/secondary_id&gt;\r\n  &lt;secondary_id&gt;NCI-G00-1906&lt;/secondary_id&gt;\r\n &lt;/id_info&gt;\r\n&lt;/clinical_study&gt;\r\n$$)\r\n)\r\nSELECT src_xml:&quot;$&quot;

What I would like to do is that **no matter how many subscribers it has, it only runs the use case whenever the user logs in**.\r\n\r\nI have tried the `share()` operator with no success as follows:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nget(): Observable&lt;State&gt; {\r\n    return this.loginStore\r\n      .get()\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        switchMap(() =&gt; from(this.getActiveInstallationUseCase.execute()).pipe(map(x =&gt; ({ activeInstallation: x })))),\r\n        share()\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nget(): Observable&lt;State&gt; {\r\n    return this.loginStore\r\n      .get()\r\n      .pipe(\r\n        switchMap(() =&gt; from(this.getActiveInstallationUseCase.execute()).pipe(map(x =&gt; ({ activeInstallation: x }))), share()),\r\n\r\n      )\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it still runs twice. I have checked that `this.loginStore.get()` emits an event only once and have tried to replace `share` with `shareReplay` but with no luck.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have replicated the issue [here](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-q5y4fz). It&#39;s calling the promise 4 times, while I would like it to be executed only twice. Adding the `share()` operator makes it work, however in my code is not, why?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486200/how-to-avoid-executing-a-promise-inside-an-observable-twice-when-subscribed-to-a","title":"How to avoid executing a promise inside an observable twice when subscribed to a BehaviourSubject?"},{"tags":["jenkins","svn","continuous-integration"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":611,"user_id":8895640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5035808eeb27263e02babf673044595f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dibakar Aditya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895640/dibakar-aditya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571670800,"post_id":58486197,"comment_id":103308795,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486197/jenkinsfile-not-found-on-multibranch-pipeline#comment103308795_58486197"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":3272170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4cc14c085162ffb1f98a85c3871711c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3272170","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3272170/user3272170"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":611,"user_id":8895640,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5035808eeb27263e02babf673044595f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dibakar Aditya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8895640/dibakar-aditya"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571676353,"post_id":58486197,"comment_id":103311591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486197/jenkinsfile-not-found-on-multibranch-pipeline#comment103311591_58486197"},{"owner":{"reputation":802,"user_id":9217817,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c0b8da87699cc74854dfcaa95301336?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user_9090","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9217817/user-9090"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571733891,"post_id":58486197,"comment_id":103329490,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486197/jenkinsfile-not-found-on-multibranch-pipeline#comment103329490_58486197"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":3272170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4cc14c085162ffb1f98a85c3871711c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3272170","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3272170/user3272170"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571752556,"post_id":58486197,"comment_id":103340007,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486197/jenkinsfile-not-found-on-multibranch-pipeline#comment103340007_58486197"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":3272170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4cc14c085162ffb1f98a85c3871711c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3272170","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3272170/user3272170"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":3272170,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e4cc14c085162ffb1f98a85c3871711c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3272170","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3272170/user3272170"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571676530,"creation_date":1571660484,"last_edit_date":1571676530,"question_id":58486197,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486197","body_markdown":"We moved a repository within our SVN and after adjusting that path accordingly in the Jenkins configuration it&#39;s unable to recognize any branches.\r\n\r\nI checked that the Jenkinsfiles are indeed there, have no extensions and there is no issue with case-sensitivity.

The urls.py and models.py don&#39;t need changing, since this does work, and it shows in the admin interface and all, however I don&#39;t know how to display it in my HTML\r\n```html\r\n{% for comment in post.comments.all %}\r\n  \r\n  {% if user.is_authenticated or comment.approved_comment %}\r\n  &lt;p&gt;Posted by: &lt;strong&gt;{{ comment.author }}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \r\n  &lt;p id=&quot;comment-text&quot;&gt;{{ comment.text|safe|linebreaks }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  &lt;p&gt;{{ comment.created_date|timesince }} ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n{% endif %}\r\n\r\n{% for reply in comment.replys %}\r\n      &lt;p&gt;Posted by: &lt;strong&gt;{{ reply.author }}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; \r\n      &lt;p id=&quot;comment-text&quot;&gt;{{ reply.text|safe|linebreaks }}&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;{{ reply.created_date|timesince }} ago&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n      {% endfor %}\r\n  {% empty %}\r\n      &lt;p&gt;No comments posted.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n  {% endfor %}\r\n```\r\nSo the actual parent comment is getting displayed no problem, but then it gets to the `for reply in comment.replys`. I don&#39;t know what I am doing wrong here. I feel like it has to do with something about the `in comment.replys`, but I don&#39;t know what.\r\n\r\nI have tried changing `replys` to `replies`, however I got an error, I changed it simply to `reply`, and it still didn&#39;t work. I then changed it to `post.comment.reply`, however again, this did not work. I have tried heaps and heaps, but nothing is working.\r\n\r\nSo what I want is for the reply to be displayed underneath the comment, and it should be working, except it isn&#39;t; I don&#39;t know where I am going wrong, so any help would be good\r\n\r\nEDIT: Here are the models\r\n```python\r\nclass Comment(models.Model):\r\n    post = models.ForeignKey(&#39;mainapp.Post&#39;,related_name=&#39;comments&#39;,on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    #...\r\n    \r\n    def get_absolute_url(self):\r\n        return reverse(&#39;post_list&#39;)\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return self.text\r\n\r\nclass Reply(models.Model):\r\n    comment = models.ForeignKey(&#39;mainapp.Comment&#39;,related_name=&#39;replies&#39;,on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    #...\r\n\r\n    class Meta:\r\n        verbose_name_plural = &quot;replies&quot;\r\n\r\n    def get_absolute_url(self):\r\n        return reverse(&#39;post_list&#39;)\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return self.text\r\n```\r\nI took out the fields, since they&#39;re not important","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486192/how-am-i-able-to-display-my-comment-replies-in-django","title":"How am I able to display my comment replies in Django"},{"tags":["typescript","visual-studio-code","tsc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3307,"user_id":1891625,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fa90a359777096c15258e207b3cb8b6c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vandesh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1891625/vandesh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571664697,"post_id":58486191,"comment_id":103305485,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486191/passing-arguments-to-tsc-using-tsconfig-json-or-tasks-json#comment103305485_58486191"}],"owner":{"reputation":327,"user_id":6691051,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0sNYSTvrlfo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZo/xf67s9oYNtU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Toivo S&#228;w&#233;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6691051/toivo-s%c3%a4w%c3%a9n"},"last_editor":{"reputation":327,"user_id":6691051,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0sNYSTvrlfo/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAZo/xf67s9oYNtU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Toivo S&#228;w&#233;n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6691051/toivo-s%c3%a4w%c3%a9n"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571663653,"creation_date":1571660467,"last_edit_date":1571663653,"question_id":58486191,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486191","body_markdown":"I would like to pass the `-b --clean` argument to `tsc` according to the instructions in [this question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57344104/6691051).

Here is my `tasks.json` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558 \r\n    // for the documentation about the tasks.json format\r\n    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0.0&quot;,\r\n    &quot;tasks&quot;: [\r\n        {\r\n            &quot;type&quot;: &quot;typescript&quot;,\r\n            &quot;tsconfig&quot;: &quot;tsconfig.json&quot;,\r\n            &quot;problemMatcher&quot;: [\r\n                &quot;$tsc&quot;\r\n            ],\r\n            &quot;group&quot;: {\r\n                &quot;kind&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;isDefault&quot;: true\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486191/passing-arguments-to-tsc-using-tsconfig-json-or-tasks-json","title":"Passing arguments to tsc using tsconfig.json or tasks.json"},{"tags":["mongodb"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":4680919,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10152870392078458/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jack Dos Santos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4680919/jack-dos-santos"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":8,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571660457,"creation_date":1571660457,"question_id":58486188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486188","body_markdown":"I signed up for MongoDb on their cloud and now need to connect to the DB. \r\nI can&#39;t get Mongo Shell installed on my localhost\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486188/install-mongo-shell-on-ubuntu-18-04","title":"Install Mongo Shell on Ubuntu 18.04"},{"tags":["javascript","jquery","asp.net"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8494879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSnW-FHha6Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADE/NuA-WUr91Tg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anand Raj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8494879/anand-raj"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571665021,"creation_date":1571665021,"answer_id":58487524,"question_id":58486184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58487524","body_markdown":"I put the asp.net button and the input textboxes inside a content template of update panel and now the button is making the server call fine.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486184/getting-error-msg-as-webresource-axdd-xxxxxxx-uncaught-typeerror-cannot-set-pr/58487524#58487524","title":"Getting error msg as WebResource.axd?d=xxxxxxx Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property &#39;value&#39; of undefined"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8494879,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZSnW-FHha6Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAADE/NuA-WUr91Tg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Anand Raj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8494879/anand-raj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":21220,"user_id":3082296,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/EmdM0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"adiga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3082296/adiga"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571665021,"creation_date":1571660453,"last_edit_date":1571660521,"question_id":58486184,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486184","body_markdown":"I am working in asp.net and while clicking on a asp.net Button I am getting an error messsage of     \r\n   \r\n\r\n     WebResource.axd?d=xxxxx \r\n        Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property &#39;value&#39; of undefined\r\n            at HTMLFormElement.WebForm_SaveScrollPositionSubmit [as submit] (WebResource.axd?d=xxxxx\r\n            at Sys$WebForms$PageRequestManager.__doPostBack [as _originalDoPostBack] (COMGeneration.aspx:46)\r\n            at Sys$WebForms$PageRequestManager$_doPostBack [as _doPostBack]\r\n    \r\nwhile trying to click a `asp:button` in the console and the server call is not made.

The `widget.child` has to wrap its content, otherwise:\r\n   `Vertical viewport was given unbounded height`. I tried wrapping `widget.child` with `Wrap` or `IntrinsicHeight` but it doesn&#39;t work. The only thing I could do is make an `assert` if `widget.child` doesn&#39;t have `shrinkWrap: true`. \r\n - The `widget.child` doesn&#39;t have to scroll, otherwise the custom widget won&#39;t scroll because `widget.child` is wrapped with a `ListView`. I tried wrapping `widget.child` with `IgnorePointer` or `GestureDetector` but I won&#39;t be able to tap on the items. The only thing I could do is make an `assert` if the `widget.child` `phyisics` aren&#39;t `NeverScrollableScrollPhysics`.\r\n - If `widget.child` has a `controller`, since `widget.child` shouldn&#39;t be scrollable, I have to pass that `controller` to the parent `ListView` but I would get: `ScrollController attached to multiple scroll views`. The only thing I could do is allow the custom widget to receive a `controller` and make an `assert` if `widget.child` has a `controller`. \r\n\r\n**Questions**\r\n\r\n - How can I solve these problems?\r\n - Is this a good approach?\r\n - What other approaches could I take?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486152/flutter-how-to-make-a-custom-widget-that-adds-a-footer-to-a-received-scrollabl","title":"Flutter - How to make a custom widget that adds a footer to a received scrollable widget?"},{"tags":["arrays","matlab","matrix","vectorization"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":806,"user_id":760030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db322c4805c7f040c83d54f1a0140114?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Irreducible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/760030/irreducible"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571662567,"post_id":58486149,"comment_id":103304204,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486149/vectorisation-of-code-for-insertion-of-n-x-n-matrices-in-a-3d-array-along-the-di#comment103304204_58486149"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9301195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/287030d7930f3e01cd1732f85ff95d6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jason Tracey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9301195/jason-tracey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":806,"user_id":760030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db322c4805c7f040c83d54f1a0140114?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Irreducible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/760030/irreducible"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571663146,"post_id":58486149,"comment_id":103304516,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486149/vectorisation-of-code-for-insertion-of-n-x-n-matrices-in-a-3d-array-along-the-di#comment103304516_58486149"},{"owner":{"reputation":806,"user_id":760030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db322c4805c7f040c83d54f1a0140114?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Irreducible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/760030/irreducible"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571663364,"post_id":58486149,"comment_id":103304673,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486149/vectorisation-of-code-for-insertion-of-n-x-n-matrices-in-a-3d-array-along-the-di#comment103304673_58486149"},{"owner":{"reputation":24,"user_id":9301195,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/287030d7930f3e01cd1732f85ff95d6f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jason Tracey","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9301195/jason-tracey"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":806,"user_id":760030,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/db322c4805c7f040c83d54f1a0140114?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Irreducible","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/760030/irreducible"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571663891,"post_id":58486149,"comment_id":103305011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486149/vectorisation-of-code-for-insertion-of-n-x-n-matrices-in-a-3d-array-along-the-di#comment103305011_58486149"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":97677,"user_id":2586922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFMSx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Luis Mendo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2586922/luis-mendo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":97677,"user_id":2586922,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFMSx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Luis Mendo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2586922/luis-mendo"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571665148,"last_edit_date":1571665148,"creation_date":1571664842,"answer_id":58487471,"question_id":58486149,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58487471","body_markdown":"This makes use of [implicit expansion](https://blogs.mathworks.com/loren/2016/10/24/matlab-arithmetic-expands-in-r2016b/), as well as [`sparse`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/sparse.html) to add values at coincident indices, and [`(:)` indexing](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/colon.html) to linearize a matrix in the usual [column-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order).\r\n\r\n    ind1 = repmat((1:n).&#39;, n, 1) + (0:N-n);

could be done with AVX2, as tagged.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this work out properly, I recommend `vector&lt;uint16_t&gt;` for the counts. Adding into the counts is the biggest problem, and the more we need to widen, the bigger the problem. `uint16_t` is enough to count one page, so you can count one page at the time and add the counters into a set of wider counters for the totals. That is some overhead, but much less than having to widen more in the main loop.\r\n\r\nThe big-endian ordering of the counts is very annoying, introducing even more shuffles to get it right. So I recommend getting it *wrong* and reordering the counts later (maybe during summing them into the totals?). The order of &quot;right shift by 7 first, then 6, then 5&quot; can be maintained for free, because we get to choose the shift counts for the 64bit blocks any way we want. So in the code below, the actual order of counts is:\r\n\r\n - Bit 7 of the least significant byte,\r\n - Bit 7 of the second byte \r\n - ...\r\n - Bit 7 of the most significant byte,\r\n - Bit 6 of the least significant byte,\r\n - ...\r\n\r\nSo every group of 8 is reversed. (at least this is what I intended to do, AVX2 [unpacks](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/unpack.php?f=punpcklbw) are confusing)\r\n\r\nCode (not tested):\r\n\r\n    while( counter &gt; 0 )\r\n    {\r\n        __m256i data = _mm256_set1_epi64x(*ptr_data);        \r\n        __m256i data1 = _mm256_srlv_epi64(data, _mm256_set_epi64x(4, 6, 5, 7));\r\n        __m256i data2 = _mm256_srlv_epi64(data, _mm256_set_epi64x(0, 2, 1, 3));\r\n        data1 = _mm256_and_si256(data1, _mm256_set1_epi8(1));\r\n        data2 = _mm256_and_si256(data2, _mm256_set1_epi8(1));\r\n\r\n        __m256i zero = _mm256_setzero_si256();\r\n\r\n        __m256i c = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[0]);\r\n        c = _mm256_add_epi16(_mm256_unpacklo_epi8(data1, zero), c);\r\n        _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[0], c);\r\n\r\n        c = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[16]);\r\n        c = _mm256_add_epi16(_mm256_unpackhi_epi8(data1, zero), c);\r\n        _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[16], c);\r\n\r\n        c = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[32]);\r\n        c = _mm256_add_epi16(_mm256_unpacklo_epi8(data2, zero), c);\r\n        _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[32], c);\r\n\r\n        c = _mm256_loadu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[48]);\r\n        c = _mm256_add_epi16(_mm256_unpackhi_epi8(data2, zero), c);\r\n        _mm256_storeu_si256((__m256i*)&amp;ptr_dot_counts[48], c);\r\n\r\n        ptr_dot_counts += 64;\r\n        ++ptr_data;\r\n        --counter;\r\n        if( ++line_count &gt;= 218 )\r\n        {\r\n            ptr_dot_counts = dot_counts.data( );\r\n            line_count = 0;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis can be further unrolled, handling multiple rows at once. That is good because, as mentioned earlier, summing into the counters is the biggest problem, and unrolling by rows would do less of that and more plain summing in registers.\r\n\r\nSomme intrinsics used:\r\n\r\n - `_mm256_set1_epi64x`, copies one `int64_t` to all 4 of the 64bit elements of the vector. Also fine for `uint64_t`.\r\n - `_mm256_set_epi64x`, turns 4 64bit values into a vector.\r\n - [`_mm256_srlv_epi64`](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/binop.php?f=vpsrlvq), shift right logical, with variable count (can be a different count for each element).\r\n - `_mm256_and_si256`, just bitwise AND.\r\n - [`_mm256_add_epi16`](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/binop.php?f=paddw), addition, works on 16bit elements.\r\n - [`_mm256_unpacklo_epi8`](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/unpack.php?f=punpcklbw) and [`_mm256_unpackhi_epi8`](https://www.officedaytime.com/simd512e/simdimg/unpack.php?f=punpckhbw), probably best explained by the diagrams on that page\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s possible to sum &quot;vertically&quot;, using one `uint64_t` to hold all the 0th bits of the 64 individual sums, an other `uint64_t` to hold all the 1st bits of the sums etc. The addition can be done by emulating full adders (the circuit component) with bitwise arithmetic. Then instead of adding just 0 or 1 to the counters, bigger numbers are added all at once.\r\n\r\nThe vertical sums can also be vectorized, but that would significantly inflate the code that adds the vertical sums to the column sums, so I didn&#39;t do that here. It should help, but it&#39;s just a lot of code.\r\n\r\nExample (not tested):\r\n\r\n    size_t y;\r\n    // sum 7 rows at once\r\n    for (y = 0; (y + 6) &lt; 15125; y += 7) {\r\n        ptr_dot_counts = dot_counts.data( );\r\n        ptr_data = ripped_pdf_data.data( ) + y * 218;\r\n        for (size_t x = 0;

The total size of the resulting ripped data can be calculated by multiplying the length (height) of the `PDF` in pixels by the width in bytes. The ripped data is `1 bit == 1 pixel`. So the size of a ripped page in bytes is `(13952 / 8) * 15125`.\r\n\r\nNote that the width is always a multiple of `64 bits`.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ll have to count the set bits for each column in each page of a `PDF` (which could be tens of thousands of pages) after being ripped.\r\n\r\nI first approached the problem with a basic solution of just looping through each byte and counting the number of set bits and placing the results in a `vector`. I&#39;ve since whittled down the algorithm to whats shown below.

The `dot_counts` `vector` should contain `15125` for each `element` after the test has completed. \r\n\r\nI&#39;m hoping some folks here can help me in getting the algorithms average execution time below 100ms.\r\nI do not care what-so-ever about portability here. \r\n\r\n - The target machine&#39;s CPU: `Xeon E5-2680 v4 - Intel`\r\n - Compiler: `MSVC++ 14.23`\r\n - OS: `Windows 10`\r\n - C++ Version: `C++17`\r\n - Compiler flags: `/O2` `/arch:AVX2`\r\n\r\nA very similar question was asked ~8 years ago:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/7793997/how-to-quickly-count-bits-into-separate-bins-in-a-series-of-ints-on-sandy-bridge\r\n\r\n(Editor&#39;s note: perhaps you missed https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55081525/count-each-bit-position-separately-over-many-64-bit-bitmasks-with-avx-but-not-a which has some more recent faster answers, at least for going down a column instead of along a row in contiguous memory.  Maybe you can go 1 or 2 cache-lines wide down a column so you can keep your counters hot in SIMD registers.)\r\n\r\nWhen I compare what I have thus far to the accepted answer I&#39;m fairly close. I was already processing in chunks of `uint64` instead of `uint8`. I&#39;m just wondering if there is more I can do, whether that be with intrinsics, assembly, or something simple like changing what data structures I&#39;m using.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486138/avx2-column-population-count-algorithm-over-each-bit-column-separately","title":"AVX2 column population count algorithm over each bit-column separately"},{"tags":["r","tidyverse"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11790507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6a7d28aa19fb14f867461a3dad72978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nikolai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11790507/nikolai"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":336,"user_id":10357383,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95da279b36eac9828256ee0b31971caa?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"caldwellst","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10357383/caldwellst"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571663373,"post_id":58486135,"comment_id":103304680,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486135/is-there-an-r-function-to-convert-columns-to-given-types#comment103304680_58486135"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1107,"user_id":7816482,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4372b3b66bb535ed836757b9c033794a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"davsjob","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7816482/davsjob"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571663979,"creation_date":1571663979,"answer_id":58487190,"question_id":58486135,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58487190","body_markdown":"There is a simple solution in the package `hablar`\r\n\r\n    library(hablar)\r\n    library(dplyr)\r\n    df &lt;- data.frame(x=&quot;1&quot;, y=&quot;2&quot;, z = &quot;4&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    df %&gt;% \r\n      convert(int(x, z),\r\n              chr(y))\r\n\r\nYou can simply put multiple column names to convert multiple columns, e.g. z and z to integer as in the example above.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486135/is-there-an-r-function-to-convert-columns-to-given-types/58487190#58487190","title":"Is there an R function to convert columns to given types?"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11790507,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d6a7d28aa19fb14f867461a3dad72978?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Nikolai","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11790507/nikolai"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571669439,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571663979,"creation_date":1571660267,"question_id":58486135,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486135","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for an R function that would do type conversion conversion for a data frame using the list of desired column types as an argument, i.e. something like\r\n\r\n    df = data.frame(x=&quot;1&quot;, y=&quot;2&quot;)\r\n    df2 = convert(df, col.types=c(&quot;integer&quot;, &quot;character&quot;))\r\n\r\nwhere df2 columns would have the specified types.

working on identifying and reversing the CRC for a Hex code that I have. \r\nThe hex code contains certain information that I have identified already, but I can&#39;t seem to be able to find the CRC and therefore reverse it so I can make changes to the file which is important for me. \r\nI have a few files of the same type with minor to major changes between them and have been trying to use that to find where the CRC might be located.\r\nI got it down to a few possible locations, however when I put the remainder in a calculator to get the CRC to verify it doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nI have a hunch that CRC-CCITT was used, but no calculator and no variation of the code seems to identify that. \r\n\r\nIs there any other way to identify and reverse the CRC?\r\n\r\nI thought about writing code for this, but I&#39;m not sure that will help since I&#39;m not absolutely sure which CRC is being used.\r\n\r\nI created an XOR file that shows me the differences. It helped me verify that I&#39;m looking for a 16-bit CRC, but not exactly what the Polynomial might be, also it might be in 2 different places.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;m having trouble identifying that start-to-end addresses from which the CRC is calculated. The Hex code I have is 18H lines*16 bytes, 25D lines*16 bytes, each line so it&#39;s very time consuming to try every variation in a calculator hoping I find the CRC. Is there any way to identify the start-to-end addresses?\r\n\r\nHere is the XOR file for reference:\r\n\r\n    00000000000001710000000000000005\r\n    00100d0032b100000000000000000000\r\n    0000000000000000000000007fc90000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    0171000000000000000500100d000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000a00\r\n    0c400000003900000000000000090000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000001a00000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    00000000000000000000000000000000\r\n    000000000000\r\n\r\n\r\nThe locations that are possible for the CRC could be:\r\n\r\n    02C and 02D = 7FC9\r\n\r\n    014 and 015 = 32B1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58486096/identifying-and-reverse-engineering-crc-from-hex","title":"Identifying and Reverse engineering CRC from Hex"},{"tags":["php","symfony","symfony-3.4"],"owner":{"reputation":1106,"user_id":1587715,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":54,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8d7f2db7a85962070e0ae1f9c433cfb8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"imclickingmaniac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1587715/imclickingmaniac"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571660080,"creation_date":1571660080,"question_id":58486094,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58486094","body_markdown":"I have private repository downloaded into `vendor/some-provider/some-repo`.\r\nThis is not a bundle.\r\n`some-repo` contains `src` directory with quite a lot of files (mostly .jar) witch I want to put in `web/some-repo/` so it can be accessed for public.\r\n\r\nIf some-repo contain bundle and `resources/public` directory I can use `bin/console assets:install`.
