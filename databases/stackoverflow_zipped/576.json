You might find that authentication (which we require) will not work with the Access-Control-Allow-Headers. We do this intentionally to forbid sending messages from front-end applications because in many cases users would hard-code their API keys and thereby expose their authentication information publicly to the Internet._","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403735/sending-email-using-axios-post-request-to-mailgun-api","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Sending email using axios post request to mailgun API"},{"tags":["c#","msbuild","csproj"],"owner":{"reputation":334,"user_id":617425,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":61,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a3f26520605b3ab6926c0433180635f9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/617425/mary"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571181515,"creation_date":1571181515,"question_id":58403734,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403734","body_markdown":"I want to create conditional compilation of a .NET framework web forms project because I want to have to build the project in two different ways.\r\nI wanted to create something like this:\r\n\r\n    #if X\r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;executeCodeX&quot;);\r\n    #else\r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;executeCodeY&quot;);\r\n    #endif\r\nwhere X should be defined in the msbuild file as a property so I can have the option to build as X or build as Y.\r\nI thought of the following two solutions:\r\n1) create a new build configuration for example buildX, and in msbuild call the msbuild command using buildX configration.

Or must I arrange the writes to my `ByteBuf` to happen on the event loop as well?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403725/although-bytebuf-is-not-guaranteed-to-be-thread-safe-will-this-use-case-be-ok","title":"Although ByteBuf is not guaranteed to be thread-safe, will this use case be OK?"},{"tags":["java","android","c++","arduino","bluetooth"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10665228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da14000e711d50bac79b5273170f5a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bartusiak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665228/bartusiak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571235543,"post_id":58410944,"comment_id":103173850,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403722/sending-data-from-ultrasonic-sensor-from-arduino-to-android-via-bluetooth/58410944#comment103173850_58410944"},{"owner":{"reputation":1254,"user_id":3535408,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/289ea239b6ee021a1789c400532aa7ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mackovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3535408/mackovich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10665228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da14000e711d50bac79b5273170f5a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bartusiak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665228/bartusiak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571299740,"post_id":58410944,"comment_id":103196737,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403722/sending-data-from-ultrasonic-sensor-from-arduino-to-android-via-bluetooth/58410944#comment103196737_58410944"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10665228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da14000e711d50bac79b5273170f5a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bartusiak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665228/bartusiak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571353808,"post_id":58410944,"comment_id":103223091,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403722/sending-data-from-ultrasonic-sensor-from-arduino-to-android-via-bluetooth/58410944#comment103223091_58410944"},{"owner":{"reputation":1254,"user_id":3535408,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/289ea239b6ee021a1789c400532aa7ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mackovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3535408/mackovich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10665228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da14000e711d50bac79b5273170f5a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bartusiak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665228/bartusiak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571499827,"post_id":58410944,"comment_id":103265512,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403722/sending-data-from-ultrasonic-sensor-from-arduino-to-android-via-bluetooth/58410944#comment103265512_58410944"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":10665228,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da14000e711d50bac79b5273170f5a49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Bartusiak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10665228/bartusiak"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571743119,"post_id":58410944,"comment_id":103334611,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403722/sending-data-from-ultrasonic-sensor-from-arduino-to-android-via-bluetooth/58410944#comment103334611_58410944"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1254,"user_id":3535408,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":24,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/289ea239b6ee021a1789c400532aa7ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mackovich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3535408/mackovich"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571221007,"creation_date":1571221007,"answer_id":58410944,"question_id":58403722,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58410944","body_markdown":"You clearly seem to have threading issue.\r\n\r\nIn your `HomeActivity` you have commented out the code that allows to open a Bluetooth Server on your Phone so that your Arduino device may connect to it, supplying the relevant `UUID` and other relevant parameters in RFCOM mode.\r\n\r\nThat code, however, is network-related and blocking and therefore should **never** be executed on the app **UI Thread** which is responsible to handle all UI tasks such as displaying views, monitoring user interactions (touch events) etc.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why your phone displays a white screen with lag.\r\n\r\nSo you should definitely execute the Bluetooth logic on a separate thread.\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;d propose the following class to handle all bluetooth-related logic.

This timer is supposed to start and stop when it is tapped, which it does, however all of the TouchTimer components I add to a page will start and stop whenever any of them are tapped, rather than only affecting the tapped component.\r\n\r\nBelow is a snippet of my component:\r\n###TouchTimer.tsx\r\n```\r\nexport class TouchTimer extends React.Component&lt;TouchTimerProps&gt;

am trying to find the average time complexity for the Fibonacci series using mathematical approach.\r\n\r\nThe best case is `O(1)`, while the worst case is `O(2^n)`. The Average case can be found by dividing the sum of times of all cases by the number of cases.\r\n\r\nSo, I believe that the average case can be found like this(using the sum of geometric series):\r\n\r\n&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\\frac{1&amp;plus;2&amp;plus;4&amp;plus;...&amp;plus;2^{n}}{n}=\\frac{\\frac{1*(1-2^{n})}{1-2}}{n}=\\frac{2^{n}-1}{n}=2^{n-1}-\\frac{1}{n}&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\\frac{1&amp;plus;2&amp;plus;4&amp;plus;...&amp;plus;2^{n}}{n}=\\frac{\\frac{1*(1-2^{n})}{1-2}}{n}=\\frac{2^{n}-1}{n}=2^{n-1}-\\frac{1}{n}&quot; title=&quot;\\frac{1+2+4+...+2^{n}}{n}=\\frac{\\frac{1*(1-2^{n})}{1-2}}{n}=\\frac{2^{n}-1}{n}=2^{n-1}-\\frac{1}{n}&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n\r\nThus, it should be still `O(2^n)` . Can you please tell me if my calculations and approach are correct?\r\n\r\nThe sample code for the `Fibonacci()` is shown below.\r\n```python\r\ndef Fibonacci(n): \r\n    if n==1: \r\n        return

v9)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy csv files have around 15k lines so you can imagine this takes quite a while. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to consolidate the queries so inserting these values takes a shorter amount of time?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403672/mysql-efficiently-importing-large-data-lists","title":"MySQL Efficiently importing large data

Unfortunately, I was not able to find resolution using the solution offered with my own issue.\r\n\r\nI am using a single line of code to adjust the height and width of an image.\r\n\r\n\r\n&gt;  $(&quot;#myImage&quot;).animate({height: &quot;+=15px&quot;,width: &quot;+=20px&quot;});\r\n\r\n\r\nThis works exactly as I want it to work from the animation standpoint but as soon as the mouse crosses the boundary of what would be the original dimensions, the image snaps back to that starting size. I have tried some variations of the solution described in the thread below for reference but am coming up short. If I replace the image with just a simple shape it is fine - it seems to only affect images.\r\n\r\n[Similar Thread][1]\r\n\r\nI am open to some additional suggestions on this one. I must be missing something or not applying it correctly.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n**Edit -\r\nA little more context...**\r\n\r\nI apologize for not offering a bit more context to begin with - I am really a rookie who loves dabbling in this stuff and who loves learning more. I had hoped there was something simple that I might have been overlooking. \r\n\r\nThe request for more code may be a little tougher than you might expect, but it did force me to write this small action out in a very small file with simple HTML and the JQuery animate line which works perfect and no snapbacks. (my re-write offered below)\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt; \r\n    &lt;script&gt;\r\n    function grow() {\r\n    $(&quot;#grass&quot;).animate({height: &quot;+=15px&quot;,width: &quot;+=20px&quot;});\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/script&gt;    \r\n    &lt;img src=&quot;http://www.thirdleveltraining.com/images/grass.jpg&quot; id=&quot;grass&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; height=&quot;250&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/br&gt;\r\n    &lt;/br&gt;\r\n    &lt;button id=&quot;myBtn&quot; onclick=&quot;grow()&quot;&gt;Grow!&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nHowever, the problem is that I am working in the realm of another program (Adobe Captivate) which publishes everything out as HTML5 and JavaScript but everything published out is so crazy dense and cryptic that it is difficult to find exactly what is going on.\r\n\r\nWhen I place an image on the stage and name it &#39;grass&#39; for example and create a button for the user to click on, I place the line of jQuery highlighted above in an area to execute it when the user clicks the button. The result is that the image expands - which works. In this environment, though - it snaps back.\r\n\r\nThe image with the name of &#39;grass&#39; seems to be referenced in the code that Adobe generates in three different places. Two are divs and one is a canvas tag. One div is given an id of &#39;re-grassc&#39;, one keeps the original name &#39;grass&#39; and the canvas tag gets an id of &#39;grassc&#39;. I have tried animating all these components thinking they maybe had to stay together but that didn&#39;t seem to help either. Pic below of the three instances.\r\n\r\n[References to image][2]\r\n\r\nI believe my issue has to do with how Adobe is packaging all the stuff up when it converts the project to HTML5 so I am not sure how to otherwise find what you might need. Ugh - sorry. I have combed the page with the console to find some sort of clue as to how I might make this work like my simple file.\r\n\r\nHere is a link to a quick published sample of the problem so you can at least see it - if it helps. You&#39;ll need to click the ugly play button after it pops up.

Don&#39;t put the update and drawing codes together. You have a drawing function `dessiner(x, y)` but you also draw in the `hasard()` and `miseAJourTouche(e)` functions. This makes things confusing and doesn&#39;t help debugging.\r\n2. Factorize more: for example, in your `hasard()` function, you makes the calculations `32 +(Math.random() * (400-64));` 6 times. Instead, you could use a function to generate a random number between two values, then initialize your values in an `init()` function. You can initialize all the variables inside as well as load your images. Depending on what you aim to make, you could also use objects, like a `Ghost` object that would initialize its coordinates, with its own `draw()` method, etc. It could be much simpler for the rest.\r\n3. Be consistent: if you put spaces before and after a `+`, then do it all the time. Don&#39;t use multiple languages inside the same code, you used both English and French (and English makes things easier when asking for help). Also, you can use a tool such as your IDE beautifier function or an online one (I used https://beautifier.io/) to make your code more readable or spot typing issues, like missing curly braces.\r\n\r\nI took the liberty of refactoring your code a bit: https://jsfiddle.net/nmerinian/t0c3sh8f/4/\r\n\r\n**Notes**:\r\n\r\n - I didn&#39;t write any condition to prevent the refresh if no key is\r\n   pressed, but it&#39;s easy to add.\r\n - I commented the background drawing part since I don&#39;t have the image.\r\n - I also commented some variables I didn&#39;t use.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403591/animation-and-randomiser-using-html-js/58404644#58404644","title":"Animation and randomiser using html/ js"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12206506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDVOs4UgrWvTl1D-YWGsWNenKofI6lUb3zqMMrmBQ=k-s128","display_name":"Mathew Wizman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12206506/mathew-wizman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12206506,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mDVOs4UgrWvTl1D-YWGsWNenKofI6lUb3zqMMrmBQ=k-s128","display_name":"Mathew Wizman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12206506/mathew-wizman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58404644,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571198903,"creation_date":1571180268,"last_edit_date":1571181038,"question_id":58403591,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403591","body_markdown":"I have a page of code in which i want 3 &quot;ghost.png&quot; to be displayed onto a canvas with random coordinates using math.random at a press of a button.

Upgrade your database to a later version that does not demonstrate this issue;\r\n 2. Contact [My Oracle Support](https://support.oracle.com/keystone/) and see if it is a known bug and if they have a resolution for the issue or what they could do to support you;\r\n 3. Parse XML data in a different way; however, on [testing](https://dbfiddle.uk/?rdbms=oracle_11.2&amp;fiddle=fbcd7c43c64b6c9b6c6808c4892ae059) `XMLTABLE`, `XMLQUERY` and `EXTRACTVALUE` all suffer from the same issue so a pure SQL solution does not appear to be available. You could embed a Java function into the database to handle parsing XML but this is going to be less performant and seems like an overreaction to the issue; or\r\n 4. Build a custom solution to test the 39,999th character for this issue and militate for it (this is probably not a viable option but is included for completeness).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403587/why-is-the-40-000th-char-of-an-xml-document-skipped-when-loading-to-an-xmltable/58427123#58427123","title":"Why is the 40,000th

Given a list of `n` points `(x_1, y_1)..(x_n, y_n)`, the algorithm finds a cubic polynomial `p_k` between `(x_k, y_k)` and `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})` with the following constraints:\r\n\r\n- polynomials `p_k` and `p_{k+1}` passes through the point `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})`;\r\n- polynomials `p_k` and `p_{k+1}` have the same first derivative at `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})`;\r\n- polynomials `p_k` and `p_{k+1}` have the same second derivative at `(x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})`.\r\n\r\nAlso, there are some boundary conditions, defined for the first and the last polynomial. I have used `natural`, which forces the second derivative to zero at the end of the curves.\r\n\r\nThe steps that you could apply are:\r\n\r\n1. Interpolate the first 10 points using the Cubic Spline.\r\n2. Assign the first derivative value at `p_10` to a variable `d`.\r\n3. Run the Cubic Spline for `p_10` and `p_11`, enforcing that the first derivative at `p_10` is `d` and the second derivative at `p_11` is zero.\r\n\r\nFrom there, you can repeat the same steps for the following points.\r\n\r\nThis code will generate a interpolation for all points:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom scipy.interpolate import CubicSpline\r\n\r\nheight=4\r\nn = 20\r\nx = np.arange(n)\r\nxs = np.arange(-0.1,n+0.1,0.1)\r\ny = np.random.uniform(low=0, high=height, size=n)\r\n\r\nplt.plot(x, y, &#39;o&#39;, label=&#39;data&#39;)\r\ncs = CubicSpline(x, y)\r\nplt.plot(xs, cs(xs), color=&#39;orange&#39;)\r\nplt.ylim([0, height+1])\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![Interpolation for 20 points][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, this code will interpolate the first 10 points, followed by another interpolation between points 10 and 11:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nk = 10\r\ndelta = 0.001\r\n\r\nplt.plot(x, y, &#39;o&#39;, label=&#39;data&#39;)\r\nxs = np.arange(x[0], x[k-1]+delta, delta)\r\ncs = CubicSpline(x[0:k], y[0:k])\r\nplt.plot(xs, cs(xs), color=&#39;red&#39;)\r\n\r\nd = cs(x[k-1], 1)\r\n\r\nxs2 = np.arange(x[k-1], x[k]+delta, delta)\r\ncs2 = CubicSpline(x[k-1:k+1], y[k-1:k+1], bc_type=((1, d), &#39;natural&#39;))\r\nplt.plot(xs2, cs2(xs2), color=&#39;blue&#39;)\r\n\r\nplt.ylim([0, height+1])\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/tclos.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/J1yJu.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403578/algorithm-for-generating-smooth-curves-from-incoming-data-points/58404337#58404337","title":"Algorithm for generating smooth curves from incoming data points"}],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":12223194,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d09da0047ad3e9a570a0397609a73337?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Whisper","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12223194/whisper"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58404337,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571204858,"creation_date":1571180127,"question_id":58403578,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58403578","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for an algorithm that smoothly interpolates points as they come in *live*. \r\n\r\nFor example, say I start with an array of 10 (x,y) pairs.

array that cab e accomplished like this:\r\n\r\n`a :=` the biggest number in the array.  \r\n`b :=` the smallest negative number in the array.\r\n\r\n`bits := 2 * max(a,-b)`\r\n\r\nLet `m` be an

After trying and failing to make that icon clickable, I thought about creating a transparent/invisible button and placing it right on top of that icon. The .css looks like this:\r\n```\r\n#hilfeBtn {\r\n        background-color:Transparent;\r\n\r\n  -webkit-border-radius: 60;\r\n  -moz-border-radius: 60;\r\n  border-radius: 60px;\r\n  font-family: Arial;\r\n  color: #ffffff;\r\n  font-size: 20px;\r\n  padding: 12px 12px 12px 12px;\r\n  border: solid #1f628d 0px;\r\n  text-decoration: none;\r\n      position:absolute;\r\n    top: 22%;\r\n    left: 5%;\r\n}\r\n\r\n##hilfeBtn:hover {\r\n  background: #3cb0fd;\r\n  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(top, #3cb0fd, #3498db);\r\n  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(top, #3cb0fd, #3498db);\r\n  background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(top, #3cb0fd, #3498db);\r\n  background-image: -o-linear-gradient(top, #3cb0fd, #3498db);\r\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #3cb0fd, #3498db);\r\n  text-decoration: none;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBut probably my plan was stupid. Because now i can&#39;t really add an eventlistener to the above icon &quot;Angebothilfe&quot; without the eventlistener ignoring the invisible button on top of it. My eventlistener looks like this:\r\n```  \r\nformElements[i].addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function(event) {\r\n        focusFunction(event);\r\n    });\r\n\r\nfunction focusFunction(event) {\r\n      console.log(&quot;clickedOn,&quot; +event.target.id+&quot;,&quot;+ Date.now())\r\n```\r\n Is there another way of doing this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403548/html-how-to-make-the-clicklistener-ignore-an-invisible-button-placed-on-an-icon","title":"HTML: How to make the clicklistener ignore an invisible button placed on an icon"},{"tags":["javascript","if-statement"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1875,"user_id":2958452,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/100001234907405/picture?type=large","display_name":"AngelSalazar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2958452/angelsalazar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571180642,"post_id":58403546,"comment_id":103152236,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403546/how-to-block-someone-from-placing-in-the-same-spot-tic-tac-toe#comment103152236_58403546"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1267,"user_id":1836461,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZHYf4.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"computercarguy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836461/computercarguy"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571181644,"creation_date":1571181644,"answer_id":58403748,"question_id":58403546,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58403748","body_markdown":"What I would normally do is have an array of values to store the moves already taken.

There&#39;s a lot of other improvements I could suggest, but I won&#39;t go into any of them either. I would basically be rewriting your game for you, so you probably wouldn&#39;t learn anything anyway. Since you are still learning, that&#39;s not a good way to teach you.\r\n\r\nIf you want to be real basic with this, put your global variable assignments (Nobmre1-9 &amp; Nombreup1-9) in a method and call it for each game, then you can give them an invalid number when someone uses the spot. Since this is a ASCII number from the keyboard, you can make the invalid number -1.

Otherwise...\r\n\r\nIMO, here are the biggest problems with `scanf`:\r\n\r\n - **Risk of buffer overflow** - if you do not specify a field width for the `%s` and `%[` conversion specifiers, you risk a buffer overflow (trying to read more input than a buffer is sized to hold).  Unfortunately, there&#39;s no good way to specify that as an argument (as with `printf`) - you have to either hardcode it as part of the conversion specifier or do some macro shenanigans.  \r\n\r\n - **Accepts inputs that *should* be rejected** - If you&#39;re reading an input with the `%d` conversion specifier and you type something like `12w4`, you would *expect* `scanf` to reject that input, but it doesn&#39;t - it successfully converts and assigns the `12`, leaving `w4` in the input stream to foul up the next read.\r\n\r\nSo, what should you use instead?\r\n\r\nI usually recommend reading *all* interactive input as text using `fgets` - it allows you to specify a maximum number of characters to read at a time, so you can easily prevent buffer overflow:\r\n\r\n    char input[100];\r\n    if ( !fgets( input, sizeof input, stdin ) )\r\n    {\r\n      // error reading from input stream, handle as appropriate\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n      // process input buffer\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOne quirk of `fgets` is that it will store the trailing newline in the buffer if there&#39;s room, so you can do an easy check to see if someone typed in more input than you were expecting:\r\n\r\n    char *newline = strchr( input, &#39;\\n&#39; );\r\n    if ( !newline )\r\n    {\r\n      // input longer than we expected\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHow you deal with that is up to you - you can either reject the whole input out of hand, and slurp up any remaining input with `getchar`:\r\n\r\n    while ( getchar() != &#39;\\n&#39; ) \r\n      ; // empty loop\r\n\r\nOr you can process the input you got so far and read again.  It depends on the problem you&#39;re trying to solve.\r\n\r\nTo *tokenize* the input (split it up based on one or more delimiters), you can use `strtok`, but beware - `strtok` modifies its input (it overwrites delimiters with the string terminator), and you can&#39;t preserve its state (i.e., you can&#39;t partially tokenize one string, then start to tokenize another, then pick up where you left off in the original string).  There&#39;s a variant, `strtok_s`, that preserves the state of the tokenizer, but AFAIK its implementation is optional (you&#39;ll need to check that `__STDC_LIB_EXT1__` is defined to see if it&#39;s available).  \r\n\r\nOnce you&#39;ve tokenized your input, if you need to convert strings to numbers (i.e., `&quot;1234&quot;` =&gt; `1234`), you have options.  `strtol` and `strtod` will convert string representations of integers and real numbers to their respective types.  They also allow you to catch the `12w4` issue I mentioned above - one of their arguments is a pointer to the first character *not* converted in the string:\r\n\r\n    char *text = &quot;12w4&quot;;\r\n    char *chk;\r\n    long val;\r\n    long tmp = strtol( text, &amp;chk, 10 );\r\n    if ( !isspace( *chk ) &amp;&amp; *chk != 0 )\r\n      // input is not a valid integer

Why is `scanf` bad?\r\n\r\nThe main problem is that `scanf` was never intended to deal with user input. It&#39;s intended to be used with &quot;perfectly&quot; formatted data. I quoted the word &quot;perfectly&quot; because it&#39;s not completely true. But it is not designed to parse data that are as unreliable as user input. By nature, user input is not predictable. Users misunderstands instructions, makes typos, accidentally press enter before they are done etc. One might reasonably ask why a function that should not be used for user input reads from `stdin`. If you are an experienced *nix user the explanation will not come as a surprise but it might confuse Windows users. In *nix systems, it is very common to build programs that work via piping, which means that you send the output of one program to another by piping the `stdout` of the first program to the `stdin` of the second. This way, you can make sure that the output and input are predictable. During these circumstances, `scanf` actually works well. But when working with unpredictable input, you risk all sorts of trouble.\r\n\r\nSo why aren&#39;t there any easy-to-use standard functions for user input? One can only guess here, but I assume that old hardcore C hackers simply thought that the existing functions were good enough, even though they are very clunky. Also, when you look at typical terminal applications they very rarely read user input from `stdin`. Most often you pass all the user input as command line arguments. Sure, there are exceptions, but for most applications, user input is a very minor thing.\r\n\r\n# So what can you do?\r\n\r\nMy favorite is `fgets` in combination with `sscanf`. I once wrote an answer about that, but I will re-post the complete code. Here is an example with decent (but not perfect) error checking and parsing. It&#39;s good enough for debugging purposes.\r\n\r\n    #define bsize 100\r\n    \r\n    char buffer[bsize];\r\n    int x,y;\r\n    float f, g;\r\n    int r;\r\n    \r\n    printf(&quot;Enter two integers: &quot;);\r\n    fflush(stdout); // Make sure that the printf is executed before reading\r\n    if(! fgets(buffer, bsize, stdin)) {\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;An error occured\\n&quot;);\r\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    if((r = sscanf(buffer, &quot;%d%d&quot;, &amp;x, &amp;y)) != 2) {\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;An error occurred. You entered:\\n%s\\n&quot;, buffer);\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;%d successful conversions&quot;, r);\r\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    printf(&quot;Enter two floats: &quot;);\r\n    fflush(stdout);\r\n    if(! fgets(buffer, bsize, stdin)) {\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;An error occurred\\n&quot;);\r\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    if((r = sscanf(buffer, &quot;%f%f&quot;, &amp;f, &amp;g)) != 2) {\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;An error occurred. You entered:\\n%s\\n&quot;, buffer);\r\n            fprintf(stderr, &quot;%d successful conversions&quot;, r );\r\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;You entered %d %d %f %f\\n&quot;, x, y, f, g);\r\n\r\nDoing like this will eliminate a common problem, which is the trailing newline that can mess with the nest input. But it has another issue, which is if the line is longer than `bsize`. You can check that with `if(buffer[strlen(buffer)-1] != &#39;\\n&#39;)`. If you want to remove the newline, you can do that with `buffer[strcspn(buffer, &quot;\\n&quot;)] = 0`.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would advise to not expect the user to enter input in some weird format that you should parse to different variables. If you want to assign the variables `height` and `width`, don&#39;t ask for both at the same time. Allow the user to press enter between them. Also, this approach is very natural in one sense. You will never get the input from `stdin` until you hit enter, so why not always read the whole line? Of course this can still lead to issues if the line is longer than the buffer. Did I remember to mention that user input is clunky in C? :)\r\n\r\nTo avoid problems with lines longer than the buffer you can use a function that automatically allocates a buffer of appropriate size, you can use `getline()`. The drawback is that you will need to `free` the result afterwards.\r\n\r\n# Stepping up the game\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re serious about creating programs in C with user input, I would recommend having a look at a library like `ncurses`. Because then you likely also want to create applications with some terminal graphics. Unfortunately, you will lose some portability if you do that, but it gives you far better control of user input. For instance, it gives you the ability to read a key press instantly instead of waiting for the user to press enter.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403537/what-can-i-use-for-input-conversion-instead-of-scanf/58403955#58403955","title":"What can I use for input conversion instead of scanf?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":17322,"user_id":559737,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f5de249db6565b87a2699e131974268a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brendan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/559737/brendan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":89738,"user_id":2410359,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pIl9T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410359/chux"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1571199110,"last_edit_date":1571199110,"creation_date":1571196395,"answer_id":58405311,"question_id":58403537,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58405311","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s state the requirements of parsing as:\r\n\r\n- valid input must be accepted (and converted into some other form)\r\n\r\n- invalid input must be rejected\r\n\r\n- **when any input is rejected, it is necessary to provide the user with a descriptive message that explains (in clear &quot;easily understood by normal people who are not programmers&quot; language) why it was rejected (so that people can figure out how to fix the problem)**\r\n\r\nTo keep things very simple, lets consider parsing a single simple decimal integer (that was typed in by the user) and nothing else. Possible reasons for the user&#39;s input to be rejected are:\r\n\r\n- the input contained unacceptable characters\r\n- the input represents a number that is lower than the accepted minimum\r\n- the input represents a number that is higher than the accepted maximum\r\n- the input represents a number that has a non-zero fractional part\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s also define &quot;input contained unacceptable characters&quot; properly; and say that:\r\n\r\n- leading whitespace and trailing whitespace will be ignored (e.g. &quot;   \r\n  5    &quot; will be treated as &quot;5&quot;)\r\n- zero or one decimal point is allowed (e.g. &quot;1234.&quot; and &quot;1234.000&quot; are both treated the same as &quot;1234&quot;)\r\n- there must be at least one digit (e.g. &quot;.&quot; is rejected)\r\n- no more than one decimal point is allowed (e.g. &quot;1.2.3&quot; is rejected)\r\n- commas that are not between digits will be rejected (e.g. &quot;,1234&quot; is rejected)\r\n- commas that are after a decimal point will be rejected (e.g. &quot;1234.000,000&quot; is rejected)\r\n- commas that are after another comma are rejected (e.g. &quot;1,,234&quot; is rejected)\r\n- all other commas will be ignored (e.g. &quot;1,234&quot; will be treated as &quot;1234&quot;)\r\n- a minus sign that is not the first non-whitespace character is rejected\r\n- a positive sign that is not the first non-whitespace character is rejected\r\n\r\nFrom this we can determine that the following error messages are needed:\r\n\r\n- &quot;Unknown character at start of input&quot;\r\n- &quot;Unknown character at end of input&quot;\r\n- &quot;Unknown character in middle of input&quot;\r\n- &quot;Number is too low (minimum is ....)&quot;\r\n- &quot;Number is too high (maximum is ....)&quot;\r\n- &quot;Number is not an integer&quot;\r\n- &quot;Too many decimal points&quot;\r\n- &quot;No decimal digits&quot;\r\n- &quot;Bad comma at start of number&quot;\r\n- &quot;Bad comma at end of number&quot;\r\n- &quot;Bad comma in middle of number&quot;\r\n- &quot;Bad comma after decimal point&quot;\r\n\r\nFrom this point we can see that a suitable function to convert a string into an integer would need to distinguish between very different types of errors; and that something like &quot;`scanf()`&quot; or &quot;`atoi()`&quot; or &quot;`strtoll()`&quot; is completely and utterly worthless because they fail to give you any indication of what was wrong with the input (and use a completely irrelevant and inappropriate definition of what is/isn&#39;t &quot;valid input&quot;).\r\n\r\nInstead, lets start writing something that isn&#39;t useless:\r\n\r\n    char *convertStringToInteger(int *outValue, char *string, int minValue, int maxValue) {\r\n        return &quot;Code not implemented yet!&quot;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {\r\n        char *errorString;\r\n        int value;\r\n\r\n        if(argc &lt; 2) {\r\n            printf(&quot;ERROR: No command line argument.\\n&quot;);\r\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n        }\r\n        errorString = convertStringToInteger(&amp;value, argv[1], -10, 2000);\r\n        if(errorString != NULL) {\r\n            printf(&quot;ERROR: %s\\n&quot;, errorString);\r\n            return EXIT_FAILURE;\r\n        }\r\n        printf(&quot;SUCCESS: Your number is %d\\n&quot;, value);\r\n        return EXIT_SUCCESS;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**To meet the stated requirements; this `convertStringToInteger()` function is likely to end up being several hundred lines of code all by itself.**\r\n\r\nNow, this was just &quot;parsing a single simple decimal integer&quot;. Imagine if you wanted to parse something complex; like a list of &quot;name, street address, phone number, email address&quot; structures; or maybe like a programming language. For these cases you might need to write thousands of lines of code to create a parse that isn&#39;t a crippled joke.\r\n\r\nIn other words...\r\n\r\n&gt; What can I use to parse input instead of

this answer I&#39;m going to assume that you are reading and\r\ninterpreting *lines of text*.\r\nPerhaps you&#39;re prompting the user, who is typing something and\r\nhitting RETURN.  Or perhaps you&#39;re reading lines of structured\r\ntext from a data file of some kind.\r\n\r\nSince you&#39;re reading lines of text, it makes sense to organize\r\nyour code around a library function that reads, well, a line of\r\ntext.\r\nThe Standard function is `fgets()`, although there are others (including [`getline`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/getline)).  And then the next step is to interpret\r\nthat line of text somehow.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the basic recipe for calling `fgets` to read a line of\r\ntext:\r\n\r\n    char line[512];\r\n    printf(&quot;type something:\\n&quot;);\r\n    fgets(line, 512, stdin);\r\n    printf(&quot;you typed: %s&quot;, line);\r\n\r\nThis simply reads in one line of text and prints it back out.\r\nAs written it has a couple of limitations, which we&#39;ll get to in\r\na minute.  It also has a very great feature: that number 512 we\r\npassed as the second argument to `fgets` is the size of the array\r\n`line` we&#39;re asking `fgets` to read into.  This fact -- that we can\r\ntell `fgets` how much it&#39;s allowed to read -- means that we can\r\nbe sure that `fgets` won&#39;t overflow the array by reading too much\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nSo now we know how to read a line of text, but what if we really\r\nwanted to read an integer, or a floating-point number, or a\r\nsingle character, or a single word?  (That is, what if the\r\n`scanf` call we&#39;re trying to improve on had been using a format\r\nspecifier like `%d`, `%f`, `%c`, or `%s`?)\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s easy to reinterpret a line of text -- a string -- as any of these things.\r\nTo convert a string to an integer, the simplest (though\r\nimperfect) way to do it is to call `atoi()`.\r\nTo convert to a floating-point number, there&#39;s `atof().\r\n(And there are also better ways, as we&#39;ll see in a minute.)\r\nHere&#39;s a very simple example:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;type an integer:\\n&quot;);\r\n    fgets(line, 512, stdin);\r\n    int i = atoi(line);\r\n    printf(&quot;type a floating-point number:\\n&quot;);\r\n    fgets(line, 512, stdin);\r\n    float f = atof(line);\r\n    printf(&quot;you typed %d and %f\\n&quot;, i, f);\r\n\r\nIf you wanted the user to type a single character (perhaps `y` or\r\n`n` as a yes/no response), you can literally just grab the first\r\ncharacter of the line, like this:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;type a character:\\n&quot;);\r\n    fgets(line, 512, stdin);\r\n    char c = line[0];\r\n    printf(&quot;you typed %c\\n&quot;, c);\r\n\r\n(This ignores, of course, the possibility that the user typed a\r\nmulti-character response; it quietly ignores any extra characters\r\nthat were typed.)\r\n\r\nFinally, if you wanted the user to type a string definitely *not* containing\r\nwhitespace, if you wanted to treat the input line\r\n\r\n\thello world!\r\n\r\nas the string `&quot;hello&quot;` followed by something else (which is what\r\nthe `scanf` format `%s` would have done), well, in that case, I\r\nfibbed a little, it&#39;s not quite so easy to reinterpret the line\r\nin that way, after all, so the answer to that part of the question will have\r\nto wait for a bit.\r\n\r\nBut first I want to go back to three things I skipped over.\r\n\r\n(1) We&#39;ve been calling\r\n\r\n    fgets(line, 512, stdin);\r\n\r\nto read into the array `line`, and where 512 is the size of the\r\narray `line` so `fgets` knows not to overflow it.  But to make\r\nsure that 512 is the right number (especially, to check if maybe\r\nsomeone tweaked the program to change the size), you have to read\r\nback to wherever `line` was declared.  That&#39;s a nuisance, so\r\nthere are two much better ways to keep the sizes in sync.\r\n(a) use the preprocessor to make a name for the size:\r\n\r\n    #define MAXLINE 512\r\n    char line[MAXLINE];\r\n    fgets(line, MAXLINE, stdin);\r\n\r\nOr, (b) use C&#39;s `sizeof` operator:\r\n\r\n    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);\r\n\r\n(2) The second problem is that we haven&#39;t been checking for\r\nerror.  When you&#39;re reading input, you should *always* check for\r\nthe possibility of error.  If for whatever reason `fgets` can&#39;t\r\nread the line of text you asked it to, it indicates this by\r\nreturning a null pointer.  So we should have been doing things like\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;type something:\\n&quot;);\r\n    if(fgets(line, 512, stdin) == NULL) {\r\n        printf(&quot;Well, never mind, then.\\n&quot;);\r\n        exit(1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nFinally, there&#39;s the issue that in order to read a line of text,\r\n`fgets` reads characters and fills them into your array until it\r\nfinds the `\\n` character that terminates the line, *and it fills\r\nthe `\\n` character into your array, too*.  You can see this if\r\nyou modify our earlier example slightly:\r\n\r\n    printf(&quot;you typed: \\&quot;%s\\&quot;\\n&quot;, line);\r\n\r\nIf I run this and type &quot;Steve&quot; when it prompts me, it prints out\r\n\r\n    you typed: &quot;Steve\r\n    &quot;\r\n\r\nThat `&quot;` on the second line is because the string it read and\r\nprinted back out was actually `&quot;Steve\\n&quot;`.\r\n\r\nSometimes that extra newline doesn&#39;t matter (like when we called\r\n`atoi` or `atof`, since they both ignore any extra non-numeric\r\ninput after the number), but sometimes it matters a lot.  So\r\noften we&#39;ll want to strip that newline off.  There are several\r\nways to do that, which I&#39;ll get to in a minute.  (I know I&#39;ve been\r\nsaying that a lot.  But I will get back to all those things, I promise.)\r\n\r\nAt this point, you may be thinking: &quot;I thought you said `scanf`\r\nwas no good, and this other way would be so much better.\r\nBut `fgets` is starting to look like a nuisance.\r\nCalling `scanf` was *so easy*!  Can&#39;t I keep using it?&quot;\r\n\r\nSure, you can keep using `scanf`, if you want.  (And for *really*\r\nsimple things, in some ways it is simpler.)  But, please, don&#39;t\r\ncome crying to me when it fails you due to one of its 17 quirks\r\nand foibles, or goes into an infinite loop because of input your\r\ndidn&#39;t expect, or when you can&#39;t figure out how to use it to do\r\nsomething more complicated.  And let&#39;s take a look at `fgets`&#39;s\r\nactual nuisances:\r\n\r\n1. You always have to specify the array size.  Well, of course,\r\nthat&#39;s not a nuisance at all -- that&#39;s a feature, because buffer\r\noverflow is a Really Bad Thing.\r\n\r\n2. You have to check the return value.  Actually, that&#39;s a wash,\r\nbecause to use `scanf` correctly, you have to check its return\r\nvalue, too.\r\n\r\n3. You have to strip the `\\n` back off.  This is, I admit, a true\r\nnuisance.  I wish there were a Standard function I could point\r\nyou to that didn&#39;t have this little problem.  (Please nobody\r\nbring up `gets`.)  But compared to `scanf&#39;s` 17 different\r\nnuisances, I&#39;ll take this one nuisance of `fgets` any day.\r\n\r\nSo how *do* you strip that newline?  Three ways:\r\n\r\n(a) Obvious way:\r\n\r\n    char *p = strchr(line, &#39;\\n&#39;);\r\n    if(p != NULL) *p = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n\r\n(b) Tricky &amp; compact way:\r\n\r\n    strtok(line, &quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this one doesn&#39;t always work.\r\n\r\n(c) Another compact and mildly obscure way:\r\n\r\n    line[strcspn(line, &quot;\\n&quot;)] = &#39;\\0&#39;;\r\n\r\nAnd now that that&#39;s out of the way, we can get back to another\r\nthing I skipped over the imperfections of `atoi()` and `atof()`.\r\nThe problem with those is they don&#39;t give you any useful\r\nindication of success of success or failure: they quietly ignore\r\ntrailing nonnumeric input, and they quietly return 0 if there&#39;s\r\nno numeric input at all.  The preferred alternatives -- which\r\nalso have certain other advantages -- are `strtol` and `strtod`.\r\n`strtol` also lets you use a base other than 10, meaning you can\r\nget the effect of (among other things) `%o` or `%x` with `scanf`.\r\nBut showing how to use these functions correctly is a story in itself,\r\nand would be too much of a distraction from what is already turning\r\ninto a pretty fragmented narrative, so I&#39;m not going to say\r\nanything more about them now.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the main narrative concerns input you might be trying\r\nto parse that&#39;s more complicated than just a single number or\r\ncharacter.  What if you want to read a line containing two\r\nnumbers, or multiple whitespace-separated words, or specific\r\nframing punctuation?  That&#39;s where things get interesting, and\r\nwhere things were probably getting complicated if you were trying\r\nto do things using `scanf`, and where there are vastly more\r\noptions now that you&#39;ve cleanly read one line of text using `fgets`,\r\nalthough the full story on all those options could probably fill\r\na book, so we&#39;re only going to be able to scratch the surface here.\r\n\r\n1. My favorite technique is to break the line up into\r\nwhitespace-separated &quot;words&quot;, then do something further with each\r\n&quot;word&quot;.  One principal Standard function for doing this is\r\n`strtok` (which also has its issues, and which also rates a whole\r\nseparate discussion).  My own preference is a dedicated function\r\nfor constructing an array of pointers to each broken-apart\r\n&quot;word&quot;, a function I describe in\r\n[these course notes](https://www.eskimo.com/~scs/cclass/notes/sx10h.html).\r\nAt any rate, once you&#39;ve got &quot;words&quot;, you can further process\r\neach one, perhaps with the same `atoi`/`atof`/`strtol`/`strtod`\r\nfunctions we&#39;ve already looked at.\r\n\r\n2. Paradoxically, even though we&#39;ve been spending a fair amount of\r\ntime and effort here figuring out how to move away from `scanf`,\r\nanother fine way to deal with the line of text we just read with\r\n`fgets` is to pass it to `sscanf`.  In this way, you end up with\r\nmost of the advantages of `scanf`, but without most of the\r\ndisadvantages.\r\n\r\n3. If your input syntax is particularly complicate, it might be appropriate to use a &quot;regexp&quot; library to parse it.\r\n\r\n4. Finally, you can use whatever *ad hoc* parsing solutions suit\r\nyou.  You can move through the line a character at a time with a\r\n`char *` pointer checking for characters you expect.  Or you can\r\nsearch for specific characters using functions like `strchr` or `strrchr`,\r\nor `strspn` or `strcspn`, or `strpbrk`.  Or you can parse/convert\r\nand skip over groups of digit characters using the `strtol` or\r\n`strtod` functions that we skipped over earlier.\r\n\r\nThere&#39;s obviously much more that could be said, but hopefully\r\nthis introduction will get you started.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403537/what-can-i-use-for-input-conversion-instead-of-scanf/58405726#58405726","title":"What can I use for input conversion instead of scanf?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":89738,"user_id":2410359,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":87,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pIl9T.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"chux","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410359/chux"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":6,"is_accepted":false,"score":6,"last_activity_date":1571200093,"creation_date":1571200093,"answer_id":58405772,"question_id":58403537,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58405772","body_markdown":"&gt; What can I use to parse input instead of scanf?\r\n\r\nInstead of `scanf(some_format, ...)`, consider `fgets()` with `sscanf(buffer, some_format_and %n, ...)`\r\n\r\nBy using `&quot; %n&quot;`, code can simply detect if _all_ the format was successfully scanned and that no extra non-white-space junk was at the end.\r\n\r\n    // scanf(&quot;%d %f fred&quot;, &amp;some_int, &amp;some_float);\r\n    #define EXPECTED_LINE_MAX 100\r\n    char buffer[EXPECTED_LINE_MAX * 2];  // Suggest 2x, no real need to be stingy.\r\n\r\n    if (fgets(buffer, sizeof buffer, stdin)) {\r\n      int n = 0;\r\n      // add -------------&gt;    &quot; %n&quot; \r\n      sscanf(buffer, &quot;%d %f fred %n&quot;, &amp;some_int, &amp;some_float, &amp;n);\r\n      // Did scan complete, and to the end?\r\n      if (n &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; buffer[n] == &#39;\\0&#39;) {\r\n        // success, use `some_int, some_float`\r\n      } else {\r\n        ; // Report bad input and handle desired.\r\n      }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403537/what-can-i-use-for-input-conversion-instead-of-scanf/58405772#58405772","title":"What can I use for input conversion instead of scanf?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571345334,"post_id":58414919,"comment_id":103220735,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403537/what-can-i-use-for-input-conversion-instead-of-scanf/58414919#comment103220735_58414919"},{"owner":{"reputation":177,"user_id":4406754,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/280c38f4cc343f0f3be19b35d2195c91?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jamesqf","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4406754/jamesqf"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571366375,"post_id":58414919,"comment_id":103225536,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58403537/what-can-i-use-for-input-conversion-instead-of-scanf/58414919#comment103225536_58414919"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7,"user_id":12226978,"user_type":"unregistered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c9c9c02c05c8913372c1cddea9d09a55?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"PMar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12226978/pmar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6171,"user_id":10795151,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-my1mKtNGgmM/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AGDgw-jGmseUXWZpbHB5MdEWNzHrxX4sxQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"JL2210","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10795151/jl2210"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":5,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571323303,"last_edit_date":1571323303,"creation_date":1571233683,"answer_id":58414919,"question_id":58403537,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58414919","body_markdown":"Other answers give the right low-level details, so I&#39;ll limit myself to a higher-level: First, analyse *what you expect* each input line to look like.

If a regular grammar suffices, then you can code up a *finite-state machine* which recognizes and interprets each command-line one character at a time.  Your code will then read a line (as explained in other replies), then scan the chars in the buffer through the state-machine.

You want to create new file only when the file could be deleted.\r\n- You don&#39;t want to stop the script even when the file couldn&#39;t be deleted.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is correct, how about this answer? Please think of this as just one of several answers.\r\n\r\n### Modification points:\r\n- In your script, I think that the if statement of `if(existing.hasNext()) {}` is required to be modified.\r\n- `muteHttpExceptions: true` is used for the request. So even if the status code is not 200, the script is not stopped.\r\n- When you want to create new file only when the file could be deleted, how about adding `if (status == 200)`?\r\n\r\n### Modified script:\r\nWhen your script is modified, please modify he if statement of `if(existing.hasNext()) {}` of your script.\r\n\r\n\tif(existing.hasNext()) {\r\n\t  var duplicate = existing.next();\r\n\t  \r\n\t  var durl = &#39;https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/&#39;+duplicate.getId();\r\n\t  var dres = UrlFetchApp.fetch(durl,{\r\n\t    method: &#39;delete&#39;,\r\n\t    muteHttpExceptions: true,\r\n\t    headers: {&#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Bearer &#39;+token}\r\n\t  });\r\n\t  var status = dres.getResponseCode();

// Added\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n- In this modification, please remove `folder.createFile(pdfBlob).setName(fileName);` at the last line of your script in your question.\r\n\r\n### Note:\r\n- As other pattern, at first, if the owner of the file is checked, how about the following modified script?\r\n\r\n\t\tif(existing.hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t  var duplicate = existing.next();\r\n\t\t  if (duplicate.getOwner().getEmail() == Session.getActiveUser().getEmail()) { // Added\r\n\t\t    var durl = &#39;https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3/files/&#39;+duplicate.getId();\r\n\t\t    var dres = UrlFetchApp.fetch(durl,{\r\n\t\t      method: &#39;delete&#39;,\r\n\t\t      muteHttpExceptions: true,\r\n\t\t      headers: {&#39;Authorization&#39;: &#39;Bearer &#39;+token}\r\n\t\t    });\r\n\t\t    var status = dres.getResponseCode();

This can not happen.**\r\n\r\n**And I need it not to give an error message if it can&#39;t save, because there are more lines below it that need to keep running until the end of the script if it doesn&#39;t save the file because there is already one with the same name.**\r\n\r\nI tried using the IF method, but it causes an error that makes the script stop, the base I tried to use

One of those fields must be cleared when I type (keyup) the `Enter` key. I know I can handle this field as a controlled field (meaning listening on `keyup` and maintain a copy of the field), or alternatively use two-way binding, but in my use case I can&#39;t do the latter, and I&#39;d rather not do the former. My question is thus, how can I force rendering of a Svelte Component?\r\n\r\nTypically, the form is displayed with `&lt;Component field=&quot;value&quot; /&gt;`, the user modifies the field and clicks the `Enter` key, and I would like `app.set(field, value)` to reset the field to `value`, even and when, to Svelte&#39;s eyes, the `field` property has not changed. Is that possible?\r\n\r\nA turn around I tried unsucessfully consists in updating the property **inside** the Svelte component, with the hope that when `app.set(field, value)`, Svelte will see two different values for the `field` property and update the component.
