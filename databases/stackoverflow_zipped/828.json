`Circle`, `Square`, `Triangle` (which are all `Shape`s) and their respective inputs `CircleInput`, `SquareInput`, and `TriangleInput` (which are disjoint) are already well-defined in this system?

But I am unable to say `ShapeInput&lt;CircleInput | TriangleInput&gt;` and enforcing this behavior requires runtime checks.\r\n\r\n**Option 2**\r\n\r\nI could use inheritance on `Shape` directly:\r\n\r\n    public abstract class AbstractShape implements Shape {\r\n    \r\n      protected final Shape shapeImpl;\r\n    \r\n      public AbstractShape(CircleInput input) {\r\n

This is commonly referred as [AJAX][1] or Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. This API enables you to manually send requests to the server and there are multiple implementations.\r\n\r\nBecause you are using jQuery I will recommend you to use the [$.ajax][2] function which is included in the jQuery library. \r\n\r\nDown here I&#39;ve made a very basic example of how to send a HTTP request to a server with the `GET` method to retrieve some data.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$.ajax({\r\n  url: &#39;https://yourdomain.com&#39;, // Where to send the request to. Can also be a file.\r\n  method: &#39;GET&#39;, // What method of request it uses.\r\n  success: function(data) { // When a response is succesfully received.\r\n    // Do something with the received data.\r\n    console.log(data); // Show what the data looks like in the console.\r\n  },\r\n  error: function(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown) { // When an error occurs while making a request.\r\n    console.log(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown); // Show the error in the console.\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\nIn your case the `url` property value might be the URL of a PHP file in which you query the database and return the result, as you mentioned you are able to do.\r\n\r\nThe response of the AJAX function (which is stored in the `data` variable in the `success` method) can be text, as in a `string`, or even JSON if you want to send structured data.\r\n\r\n**Beware** of the Asynchronous part. This means that the AJAX code does not stop the execution of the rest of your JavaScript code, but simply continues and comes back whenever the HTTP request has been completed.\r\n\r\nI hope that this is enough to get you started. Good luck and don&#39;t hesitate to ask questions.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started\r\n  [2]: https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345486/jquery-tabledit-dropdown-is-it-possible-to-retrieve-values-from-mysql-database/58345867#58345867","title":"jquery tabledit dropdown: is it possible to retrieve values from mysql database?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12202174,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9938da5cdec9734cc4808a42ba483872?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"nucelar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12202174/nucelar"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1046,"user_id":11619647,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ojE2e4_sPbQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAKc/rH6JNSNvsLU/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Emiel Zuurbier","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11619647/emiel-zuurbier"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570825096,"creation_date":1570812453,"last_edit_date":1570825096,"question_id":58345486,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58345486","body_markdown":"I&#39;m using the [jquery tabledit][1] plug-in to update a database.

I want to pass trigger an ECS instance when a file is uploaded to a\r\n&gt; bucket in s3 and process the uploaded file\r\n\r\nFirst thing, Environment variable load at the boot time of application while the event is not known at the start of application.\r\n\r\nSo the best way to handle this is [SNS or SQS notification on s3 put event][1]. You need\r\n\r\n - Put the file on S3\r\n - Event notification sent to SNS (data enters S3, notification of new data is sent to SNS)\r\n - SNS will trigger HTTP endpoint of your ECS container ( I assume that you already expose endpoint to process SNS topic.\r\n - Get the Name of the object and S3 bucket Name from SNS topic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also use SQS with SNS but HTTP endpoint seems good,A high-level architecture will look like\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\nOr details diagram\r\n\r\n\r\n[![End to end diagram][3]][3]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

I have an event which happens once a year on the `release_Date` (which I have tried to best replicate using the stock data below). I measure this event with a `score` denoted in the `score` column.\r\n\r\nUltimately what I want to do is rebalance the portfolios each month and compute the returns for each portfolio. \r\n\r\nEach month I want to apply the rolling function to look at the `score` and assign a `1` if its in the top `ntile` or `2` if its in the bottom `ntile` That is, I want to use `ntile` in somewhat the following way but for each month `df_monthly %&gt;%\r\n  mutate(rank = ntile(score, 2))`.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty I am having is that I want to compute the portfolio returns for all assets in `rank = 1` and the portfolio returns for all assets in `rank = 2` at each month. An assets score can fall out of `rank = 1` and into `rank = 2` from one month to the next depending on new `score`&#39;s coming into the function.\r\n\r\nThat is, in month 1, `GOOG`, `MSFT` and `AMZN` might be in `rank = 1` and `WAL`, `MMM` and `HOG` might be in `rank = 2`. In month 2 the rankings might change because new scores have entered the function and `rank = 1` might now look like: `HOG`, `GOOG`, `MMM`.\r\n\r\nI would like to try and set the lag period, i.e. compute the `ntiles` using the last 3 months of `score`&#39;s - only considering the companies who have experienced the event in the past 3 months.\r\n\r\nAny pointers in the right direction would be useful. If I am not clear in some place, let me know and I will re-word some parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe data looks like:\r\n\r\n    # A tibble: 2,717 x 6\r\n       symbol  year date       monthly.returns

If the claim has been progressed through all five stages of its life through final release into A/P, then the only way that the form can be fully refreshed so that this pair of custom fields are finally populated from the employee record is to click the Refresh button on the toolbar of the expense claim receipt details grid displayed in the lower section of the expense claim form. I have been searching exhaustively online for a way of forcing the form to auto-refresh whenever it is opened, most especially for an existing claim versus a new one, but have not yet been able to make any code based refresh solutions I have tried to employ successfully compile and become embedded within the customization. Ideally, what I would really like to be able to code and implement is an automatic execution at form opening of the Refresh button located on the toolbar of the expense claim receipt details grid.

second routine is printing only two values because it is calling `isPrime`, but never doing anything conditional on the value returned, but rather incrementing `count` regardless. And since you’re printing only if `count` is `&lt;= 1`, that will happen only for the first two values of `n`.\r\n\r\nBut let’s say you were trying to print the prime numbers up to a certain number, you could do:\r\n\r\n    func printPrimes(upTo n: Int) {\r\n        for x in 1...n {\r\n            if isPrime(x) {\r\n                print(x)\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(As a matter of convention, in Swift, when we say “through `n`”, we’d iterate `1...n`, and if someone said “up to `n`”, we’d iterate `1..&lt;n`. But because your original code snippet uses `upTo` in conjunction with `1...n`, I’ll use that here, but just note that this isn’t very consistent with standard Swift API patterns.)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `isPrime` is not correct, either. So you’ll have to fix that first. For example, consider 25. That is not divisible by 2 or 3, but isn’t prime, either.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the original `printPrimes` that was provided, what it effectively does is say “by how many whole integers less than `x` is `x` divisible ... if only divisible by one other number (namely `1`), then it’s a prime.” That logic, although not efficient, is correct. You should go ahead and use that inside your `isPrime` routine. But that “is divisible by 2 or 3” logic is not correct.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345433/how-to-properly-call-another-function-within-a-function-in-swift/58345919#58345919","title":"How to properly call another function within a function in swift?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":5431699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZQ_LWmVt8oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/XDAsLifbKNw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kamanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5431699/kamanda"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570818608,"post_id":58346031,"comment_id":103048422,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345433/how-to-properly-call-another-function-within-a-function-in-swift/58346031#comment103048422_58346031"},{"owner":{"reputation":172,"user_id":11559619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEDJt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NicolasElPapu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11559619/nicolaselpapu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":78,"user_id":5431699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZQ_LWmVt8oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/XDAsLifbKNw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kamanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5431699/kamanda"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570818736,"post_id":58346031,"comment_id":103048485,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345433/how-to-properly-call-another-function-within-a-function-in-swift/58346031#comment103048485_58346031"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":172,"user_id":11559619,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/vEDJt.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"NicolasElPapu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11559619/nicolaselpapu"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570815138,"creation_date":1570815138,"answer_id":58346031,"question_id":58345433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58346031","body_markdown":"You can do it this way, in your printPrimes you can loop up to the number you want and just check if the number is prime by calling the function with the number.

Your printPrimes should only do what its name says (print the prime numbers up to n) and all the logic to check if the number is prime should be on your isPrime function.\r\nAlso its a good practice to use camelCase on functions, you should rename your function to printPrimes instead of PrintPrimes.\r\n```\r\nfunc printPrimes(upTo n: Int) {\r\n    for x in 1...n {\r\n        if isPrime(x) {\r\n            print(x)\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345433/how-to-properly-call-another-function-within-a-function-in-swift/58346031#58346031","title":"How to properly call another function within a function in swift?"}],"owner":{"reputation":78,"user_id":5431699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZQ_LWmVt8oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/XDAsLifbKNw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kamanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5431699/kamanda"},"last_editor":{"reputation":78,"user_id":5431699,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ZQ_LWmVt8oc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/XDAsLifbKNw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kamanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5431699/kamanda"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":59,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58345919,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570816756,"creation_date":1570812207,"last_edit_date":1570814697,"question_id":58345433,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58345433","body_markdown":"I&#39;m learning an swift and I&#39;ve written two functions and have tried them on their own they both work well.

Hence the error. Here&#39;s a workaround with lambdas and `std::functional`:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n   Foo () {}\r\n\r\n   void DoTheThing1 (std::function&lt;void()&gt;&amp; theThing) {\r\n      theThing();\r\n   }\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar {\r\npublic:\r\n   Foo* foo = new Foo();\r\n\r\n   Bar () {\r\n      foo-&gt;DoTheThing1([this](){ DoTheThing2(); });\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   void DoTheThing2 () {\r\n      // Something happens.\r\n   }\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf `std::functional` proves to be a bottleneck, you can use a templated function instead:\r\n\r\n```C++\r\n#include &lt;functional&gt;\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n   Foo () {}\r\n\r\n   template &lt;typename Callable&gt; \r\n   void DoTheThing1 (Callable&amp;&amp; theThing) {\r\n      theThing();\r\n   }\r\n};\r\n\r\nclass Bar {\r\npublic:\r\n   Foo* foo = new Foo();\r\n\r\n   Bar () {\r\n      foo-&gt;DoTheThing1([this](){ DoTheThing2(); });\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   void DoTheThing2 () {\r\n      // Something happens.\r\n   }\r\n\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nIf you want to store a pointer to a member function, you also need an instance of that class in order to be able to call it later.

I bought a blank phone for this purpose, so no data is at risk. After following the steps on the XDA guide, I only got so before things did not work as they described. If I reboot my phone, I get this blue Moto G6 bootscreen and the phone never boots. I can get TWRP running on the phone though.  Right now, my phone is not being recognized by either adb or fastboot. The guide I&#39;ve been following is at\r\n\r\nhttps://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g6/how-to/guide-twrp-root-magisk-installation-t3816569\r\n\r\n```\r\nc:\\Software\\MotoG6&gt;adb shell\r\nerror: no devices/emulators found\r\nc:\\Software\\MotoG6&gt;fastboot devices\r\n\r\nc:\\Software\\MotoG6&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have the latest Moto G6 drivers installed, but I don&#39;t think they apply anymore. If I unplug and replug in the USB cable into my Windows machine, it says it does not recognize the device.\r\n\r\nThe firmware I saw on the device when it did boot was OPSS27.82-87\r\n\r\n***  I do not know how to go back to stock because it won&#39;t recognize the device enough for me to push the stock image to it. ***\r\n\r\n*** FWIW, even on step 3 of that guide, it would say the boot image was not signed or corrupt. This happened when I tried to do \r\n```\r\nfastboot flash boot &lt;insert-boot-image-name-here&gt;.img\r\n```\r\nsomeone else had that problem and the recommendation was to ignore the message and reboot to recovery. \r\n\r\n(https://forum.xda-developers.com/moto-g4-plus/development/wip-twrp-3-0-2-2-recovery-moto-g4-plus-t3386586/page2)\r\n\r\nFor those who would say, &quot;Read the **** manual&quot;, bear in mind that I did read the manual. No manual said where to get the firmware information they asked for. Also, many of the image links were bad. They did not say how to handle the case where the image did not install as they said it would.  Somehow these manufacturers make each phone just enough different, and each firmware is different that it&#39;s impossible to predict what a phone will say ahead of time with certainty.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345410/moto-g6-device-not-found-after-rooting-process","title":"Moto G6 device not found after rooting process"},{"tags":["python","django","django-models","django-rest-framework","django-serializer"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11029572,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e827988a6d0e84c0cfd781fe6701673e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Siddharth Rakholiya","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11029572/siddharth-rakholiya"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1062,"user_id":5763627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/941560632625951/picture?type=large","display_name":"Divyanshu Rawat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5763627/divyanshu-rawat"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570866202,"last_edit_date":1570866202,"creation_date":1570856754,"answer_id":58351034,"question_id":58345409,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58351034","body_markdown":"Your Serializer class must contain model **MealDate**, create custom **post** method by using APIVIEW.\r\nFirst of all, create **UserFoodHistory** instance, and after that create a bulk entry in **MealDate** with passing that instance in **user_food_history** field.\r\n\r\nIn post API pass old and new id and from request and in APIVIEW delete old entries(if exist) in **MealDate** and create a new one.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345409/creating-updating-model-with-multiple-manytomany-and-through-relationships/58351034#58351034","title":"Creating/Updating Model with Multiple &quot;ManyToMany&quot; and &quot;through&quot; Relationships"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12115154,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/08a5cc2d396832218f7560a93790cd3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"papoj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12115154/papoj"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1285,"user_id":5178801,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/exq4J.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"J.

am trying to design a WPF app in which the user can create objects of class &quot;Process&quot; by typing in object name and attributes, then add them to a List of Processes. The list is then serialized into an XML document with a button click event.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to declare several Processes (with attributes), add them to a list and store the list as a single XML document.\r\n\r\nHowever, the &quot;add Process to List&quot; command only works for the first instance of the object. When another object is added, it replaces the first object in the list and adds a copy of itself, instead of being written under it.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\nFirst step, input of process name and attributes:\r\n\r\n     \r\n        List&lt;Process&gt; PList = new List&lt;Process&gt;();\r\n        Process Procx = new Process();\r\n        List&lt;Process.PParameter&gt; Listnew = new List&lt;Process.PParameter&gt;(); \r\n\r\n        private void AddNewProcessBTN_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            Process tempProc = new Process();     \r\n            string tempPID = PIDTB.Text;\r\n            tempProc.PID = Int32.Parse(PIDTB.Text);\r\n            tempProc.PName = PNameTB.Text;\r\n            tempProc.PType = PTypeTB.Text;\r\n            string tempPstation = PIDTB.Text;\r\n            tempProc.PStation = Int32.Parse(PStationTB.Text);\r\n            DataGridXAML.Items.Add(tempProc);\r\n\r\n            Procx.PID= Int32.Parse(PIDTB.Text);\r\n            Procx.PName= PNameTB.Text;\r\n            Procx.PType = PTypeTB.Text;\r\n            Procx.PStation = Int32.Parse(PStationTB.Text);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    \r\nStep 2: Adding the &quot;Process&quot; to the list (where the problem is)\r\n    \r\n\r\n        private void Add2ListBTN_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            Process tempp = new Process();\r\n            tempp = Procx;\r\n\r\n            tempp.Ps = Listnew;\r\n\r\n            PList.Add(tempp);          \r\n        }\r\n    \r\nStep 3: serialization\r\n    \r\n\r\n        private void SerializeProcessBTN_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)\r\n        {\r\n            using (Stream serp2 = new FileStream(@&quot;C:\\Users\\solda\\CsharpData\\Plist.xml&quot;, FileMode.Create,\r\n            FileAccess.Write, FileShare.None))\r\n            {\r\n                XmlSerializer serializer2 = new XmlSerializer(typeof(List&lt;Process&gt;));\r\n                serializer2.Serialize(serp2, PList);\r\n            }\r\n            PList = null;\r\n        }    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I fix this?

I setup the app &amp; the volumes &amp; containers are up &amp; running. I can hit the service `api` at port 9000 fine from browser &amp; confirm that the db is populated. However, my `web` service is unable to get the data from the api. &lt;s&gt;How can I confirm that the above assertion is correct &amp; that the web really cannot communicate with the api service.&lt;/s&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd how can I fix this &amp; get the web to receive the data from api. Apologies for the newbie question.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nWhen I run `ping api` from within the `web` container using `docker exec -it [containerID] /bin/sh`, I am recieving a response in the form of :\r\n\r\n  `64 bytes from 172.18.0.4: seq=139 ttl=64 time=0.084 ms`\r\n\r\nSo, clearly, my assertion is incorrect. Why is `web` service unable to get a response from `api` service. When I load the `web` app in browser, I do not get any log display in the terminal of the api being hit.\r\n\r\nEDIT-2 :\r\n\r\nAs per @runwuf question &amp; my response, clearly, the &#39;web&#39; is able to communicate with the &#39;api&#39; service. So, something else is wrong. Here are the steps, we follow to setup the stack on our systems. I use a Linux Mint 19.2 OS, while the team uses Macs.

However, as soon as an `iframe` is loaded into the page with a **PDF** as the `src` and you refresh the page, the print dialog will no longer be shown when clicking on the button that should execute the `window.print()` function.\r\n\r\nThe issue does not happen in MS Edge, neither in Firefox... Only the latest version of **Google Chrome (77.0.3865.120)** seems to be affected. Is this a Chrome bug?\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the bug\r\n==========================\r\n1. Drop the below code in an html file and put it on a webserver (e.g. WampServer)\r\n2. Navigate in Chrome to index.html\r\n3. Click [Open print dialog]          ==&gt; Ok\r\n4. Click [Create iframe]              ==&gt; Ok\r\n5. Refresh index.html\r\n6. Click [Open print dialog]          ==&gt; Not ok! Will not open the print dialog\r\n7.

want to use the Linux GPIO API to receive a signal when the level of a GPIO changes.\r\n\r\nSince `poll()` will receive a `POLLPRI` event, I assumed I could just register a handler for `SIGURG` and use `fcntl()` to make the fd associated with the GPIO send a signal when the event occurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a Raspberry PI with GPIO Pins 13 and 26 connected, the following code should print the current level followed by &quot;rising&quot; or &quot;falling&quot; every second:\r\n\r\n\r\n```C\r\n#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;linux/gpio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;poll.h&gt;\r\n#include

this into a signal?\r\nAnother solution would be to `fork()` and use `poll()` in the child, sending a proper signal to the parent when `poll()` returns - but I&#39;d like to avoid that overhead.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345334/how-to-generate-a-signal-on-a-gpio-event-on-linux","title":"How to generate a signal() on a GPIO event on

onMouseDown={this.handleOnMouseDown} onMouseUp={this.handleOnMouseUp}&gt;\r\n        ...\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nThe state is setting normally but now if I select a text it is not highlighted.\r\n\r\nHow can we propagate the event so that it behave normally but with changing the state?\r\n\r\n**EDIT:**\r\n\r\nWhat I need is just to keep select the text (such as every web-page when you hold the mouse on a text) but also change state.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345330/setting-react-state-in-onmousedown-event-causing-no-text-selection","title":"Setting

The `QueryDosDevice()` method will apparently fail if the trailing backslash is there, so I made a quick code edit:\r\n\r\n```vb.net\r\nDriveLetter = IO.Path.GetPathRoot(PathToTest).Replace(&quot;\\&quot;, &quot;&quot;) &#39; &lt;--Replace ANY/ALL backslashes\r\n```\r\nI again tested with my `SUBST H: D:\\substtest` drive with an existing file/directory structure as above.

After a bit of validation, the &quot;encapsulating&quot; method converts the string to a UNC or absolute path, depending on the path that&#39;s passed in, to return elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA couple of examples:\r\n\r\n* For drive `U:\\` mapped to `\\\\SERVERNAME\\Share`, using the `\\HKCU\\Network\\` key in the Windows Registry to find network drive mappings on the local computer, `U:\\PublicFolder\\SomeFile.txt` becomes `\\\\SERVERNAME\\Share\\PublicFolder\\SomeFile.txt`\r\n\r\n* Alternately, `C:\\SomeFolder\\SomeFile.txt` is left unchanged because (as determined within the method) it&#39;s an absolute path to a local, physical drive.\r\n\r\nSo far, most of this appears to be working well and as expected, but I&#39;m encountering an issue with regards to drives created by the `SUBST` command in Windows 10 (*at least - I haven&#39;t run any tests under another OS at this time because I don&#39;t have another available to me right now*).\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I don&#39;t have much experience with the `SUBST` command and don&#39;t use it very often, so, at first, I was having trouble even getting the drive to show up correctly in Windows. After reading through a discussion on the Microsoft Community page ([Windows 10 issue &quot;Subst&quot; command doesn&#39;t work](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-issue-subst-command-doesnt-work/d38c5130-b2b1-4a85-8ef6-ef1206c3174c)), I was finally able to get the drive set up &quot;properly&quot; (*don&#39;t use an elevated command prompt, BTW*), but the code I&#39;m using to test for a `SUBST`-ed drive - converted to VB.NET from [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37278193/2569697) - was still not resolving the full path correctly.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the converted code I&#39;m using (I intend to do some &quot;tweaking&quot; later once I have everything working, but this is the current state):\r\n\r\n```vb.net\r\n&lt;DllImport(&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;, SetLastError:=True)&gt;\r\nPrivate Shared Function QueryDosDevice(ByVal lpDeviceName As String, ByVal lpTargetPath As System.Text.StringBuilder, ByVal ucchMax As Integer) As UInteger\r\nEnd Function\r\n\r\nPrivate Shared Function IsSubstPath(ByVal pathToTest As String, &lt;Out&gt; ByRef realPath As String) As Boolean\r\n\tDim PathInformation As System.Text.StringBuilder = New System.Text.StringBuilder(260)\r\n\tDim DriveLetter As String = Nothing\r\n\tDim WinApiResult As UInteger = 0\r\n\r\n\trealPath = Nothing\r\n\r\n\tTry\r\n\t\t&#39; Get the drive letter of the path\r\n\t\tDriveLetter = IO.Path.GetPathRoot(pathToTest).Replace(&quot;\\\\&quot;, &quot;&quot;)\r\n\tCatch ex As ArgumentException\r\n\t\tReturn False\r\n\tEnd Try\r\n\r\n\tWinApiResult = QueryDosDevice(DriveLetter, PathInformation, 260)\r\n\r\n\tIf WinApiResult = 0 Then\r\n\t\tDim LastWinError As Integer = Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()\r\n\r\n\t\tReturn False\r\n\tEnd If\r\n\r\n\t&#39; If the drive is SUBST&#39;ed, the result will be in the format of &quot;\\??\\C:\\realPath\\&quot;.\r\n\tIf PathInformation.ToString().StartsWith(&quot;\\??\\&quot;) Then\r\n\t\tDim RealRoot As String = PathInformation.ToString().Remove(0, 4)\r\n\r\n\t\tRealRoot += If(PathInformation.ToString().EndsWith(&quot;\\&quot;), &quot;&quot;, &quot;\\&quot;)\r\n\t\trealPath = IO.Path.Combine(RealRoot, pathToTest.Replace(IO.Path.GetPathRoot(pathToTest), &quot;&quot;))\r\n\r\n\t\tReturn True\r\n\tEnd If\r\n\r\n\trealPath = pathToTest\r\n\tReturn False\r\nEnd Function\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich I call like this for a drive I created using `SUBST H: D:\\substtest`:\r\n\r\n```vb.net\r\nDim TestFile As New IO.FileInfo(&quot;H:\\0984\\CPI.TXT&quot;)\r\nDim SubstPath As String = String.Empty\r\nDim FullPath As String = String.Empty\r\n\r\nIf IsSubstPath(FullPath, SubstPath) Then\r\n    FullPath = SubstPath\r\nEnd If\r\n```\r\nMy expectation is that the `IsSubstPath()` method *should* return `D:\\substtest\\0984\\CPI.TXT` via the `realPath` variable. Executing `SUBST` (without additional parameters) correctly showed the mapping in the command prompt (`H:\\: =&gt; D:\\substtest`). Checking the `TestFile` object while debugging shows that it&#39;s `Exists()` property returns `True`, so the file system does, apparently, know that it&#39;s there.\r\n\r\nAt this point, every time I execute the code, the `QueryDosDevice()` method call returns a value of `0`, although I get varying results from the `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()` call as I continue to try to get this working.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt after getting the `SUBST`-ed drive &quot;properly&quot; set up on my machine resulted in the `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()` returning error code [1008 - ERROR_NO_TOKEN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--1000-1299-) (&quot;*An attempt was made to reference a token that does not exist*&quot;).\r\n\r\nFurther reading in the linked MS community thread indicated that running `SUBST` *twice* - *once* in a normal command prompt, and *again* in an elevated command prompt - *should* make the drive available to either a regular logged on user as well as any elevated user action. I re-ran `SUBST` in an elevated command prompt and tried again using the same testing code as above. This time, `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()` returned error code [6 - ERROR_INVALID_HANDLE](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-) (*&quot;The handle is invalid.&quot;*).\r\n\r\nThinking this particular operation *might* be dependent on the file/path actually existing on the system (as opposed to the .NET `IO.FileInfo` or `IO.DirectoryInfo` objects), I manually created the specific subfolder and file to represent what I was testing for in my code (`H:\\0984\\CPI.TXT`) and tried it once more (again, using the same code as above):\r\n\r\nOnce again, the `QueryDosDevice()` failed to correctly parse the real path (returned `0`), but this time the `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()` method returned a value of [0 - ERROR_SUCCESS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/system-error-codes--0-499-) (*&quot;The operation completed successfully.&quot;*). Thinking that, perhaps there was some &quot;flaw&quot; in the code that might unintentionally be skipping a step or something, I checked the `PathInformation` variable - the `Text.StringBuilder` object that holds the results of the `QueryDosDevice()` - in break mode but, alas it&#39;s also empty.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: I also tried using a directory instead of a file, but `H:\\0984\\` resulted in a `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error()` return value of `0` while `H:\\0984` resulted in a value of `6`. Based on the previous testing, this all makes sense but it nonetheless results in an empty `PathInformation` variable (failure).*\r\n\r\nReading all around the Interwebz, it seems many people are experiencing a variety of issues with `SUBST`-ed drives under Windows 10, so I&#39;m left wondering at this point if *that&#39;s* the reason for these unexpected results. Has anyone else encountered these issues and, if so, have you been able to resolve them in code?\r\n\r\nIn case it matters (as I suppose it certainly might), here are some additional details:\r\n\r\n* I&#39;m using Visual Studio 2017 CE and my project is compiling under .NET Framework 4.7.2\r\n* The physical drive to which I&#39;m creating the `SUBST` path is a RAID 1 pair of drives formatted with NTFS and has plenty of space (178 GB).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n*NOTE: I have also tried creating a `SUBST`-ed path to my OS drive (`C:\\`) for the testing, but this gets the same results as above.*\r\n\r\nIf I&#39;ve left anything out, or if you require further clarification, please let me know in the comments and I&#39;ll update the question as needed.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345316/drive-created-by-subst-windows-10-not-reporting-full-path-to-querydosdevice","title":"Drive created by SUBST (Windows 10) Not Reporting Full Path to QueryDosDevice()"},{"tags":["javascript","android"],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10180180,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ca6490b79ac1aaf4908c65b64f072bdb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"usfaa444","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10180180/usfaa444"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570811636,"creation_date":1570811636,"question_id":58345314,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58345314","body_markdown":"I want to send multiple notification to multiple users.\r\nit is an e-commerce app and i would like whenever a list of product have been paid, notifications are sent to every concerned seller for all of his product that have been paid. but my code is sending only one notification to the first related product and that&#39;s all.\r\n\r\nI have already implement notification code but this was only for sending one notification to one user so that was prety easy.

This leaves leading and trailing whitespace on each line. \r\n\r\n`^\\s+$[\\r\\n]*` is a regex used to strip empty lines from an input string. \r\n\r\n - `^\\s+$` Match a line that contains nothing but whitespace\r\n - `[\\r\\n]*` Match any number of newlines or return characters after this empty line.\r\n\r\nThe second piece of the regex is necessary because otherwise, a pair of newlines between two lines of input would be left in place. Note that a similar effect could be achieved with `^\\s+$\\s*`\r\n\r\n[Demo][1]\r\n\r\n----\r\n```c#\r\n        if (text.Contains(&quot;My Own String:&quot;))\r\n        {\r\n            combinedOutput = Regex.Split(text, &quot;:&quot;)[1].ToString().Trim();\r\n            combinedAuth = true;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the text has been reduced to a single line, those lines are checked to see if they begin with the phrase `My Own String:` - if they do, the phrase is removed via `Regex.Split()` by breaking on the colon. The resulting string is then trimmed to remove leading and trailing whitespace. If the text did NOT begin with `My Own String:`, any leading or trailing whitespace is left intact.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n```c#\r\n        if (!(text == &quot;&quot;) &amp;&amp; !(text == Environment.NewLine) &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot; &quot;) &amp;&amp; text != null &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot;\\r\\n&quot;) &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot;\\n&quot;))\r\n        {\r\n            combinedError = text;\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe text is now examined. If...\r\n\r\n - `!(text == &quot;&quot;)` The string isn&#39;t empty, and...\r\n - `!(text == Environment.NewLine)` The string does not consist of solely a newline (on Unix) or a newline and carriage return (on Windows), and...\r\n - `!(text == &quot; &quot;)` The string does not consist of solely a space, and...\r\n - `text != null` The string is not `null`, and... \r\n - `!(text == &quot;\\r\\n&quot;)` The string does not consist of a carriage return and a newline, and...\r\n - `!(text == &quot;\\n&quot;)` The text does not consist solely of a newline...\r\n\r\n...then `combinedError` is set equal to the processed and checked string. I believe this segment of code could be significantly refactored; checking for `null` is usually the first conditional statement to avoid NullPointerExceptions, and `Environment.NewLine` covers both `\\r\\n` and `\\n`.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://regex101.com/r/DwHBvS/3/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345313/how-to-calculate-this-string-with-regex/58356709#58356709","title":"how to calculate this string with regex?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10625988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/39a68fb5a383abf6e51e04f7260c55f8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dino01","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10625988/dino01"},"last_editor":{"reputation":71612,"user_id":372239,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2twLb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Toto","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/372239/toto"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570901340,"creation_date":1570811631,"last_edit_date":1570812527,"question_id":58345313,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58345313","body_markdown":"```\r\nprivate static void ReceivedEventHandler(object sender, DataReceivedEventArgs e)\r\n{\r\n\tif (e.Data != null)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tstring text = Regex.Replace(e.Data, &quot;^\\\\s+$[\\\\r\\\\n]*&quot;, &quot;&quot;, RegexOptions.Multiline);\r\n\t\tif (text.Contains(&quot;My Own String:&quot;))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tcombinedOutput = Regex.Split(text, &quot;:&quot;)[1].ToString().Trim();\r\n\t\t\tcombinedAuth = true;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\tif (!(text == &quot;&quot;) &amp;&amp; !(text == Environment.NewLine) &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot; &quot;) &amp;&amp; text != null &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot;\\r\\n&quot;) &amp;&amp; !(text == &quot;\\n&quot;))\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\tcombinedError = text;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code I have from the program that does read some strings\r\nfor example, string text contains &quot;1bc4bb7de4c58a7eba6b95b565b21a4b26b5528c2be242b96fe014bf7ff403ca&quot;\r\nand than it replaces/calculates the string with Regular Expressions: ^\\\\s+$[\\\\r\\\\n]* like the code I put above.

Any time I apply this type of filter it causes this crash to occur. \r\n\r\nAny advice is appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345292/swiftui-fails-to-compile-when-attempting-to-filter-data-using-string-comparison","title":"SwiftUI fails to compile when attempting to filter data using string comparison"},{"tags":["time-complexity"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570811963,"post_id":58345289,"comment_id":103045746,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345289/how-many-times-will-be-this-statement-will-be-executed#comment103045746_58345289"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12090559,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/070670fc39b1f342db61c4c5734b5a3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hritik Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12090559/hritik-kumar"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":197263,"user_id":67579,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":81,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BJXub.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Willem Van Onsem","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/67579/willem-van-onsem"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570812030,"post_id":58345289,"comment_id":103045772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345289/how-many-times-will-be-this-statement-will-be-executed#comment103045772_58345289"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12090559,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/070670fc39b1f342db61c4c5734b5a3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hritik Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12090559/hritik-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570817015,"post_id":58346312,"comment_id":103047802,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345289/how-many-times-will-be-this-statement-will-be-executed/58346312#comment103047802_58346312"},{"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12090559,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/070670fc39b1f342db61c4c5734b5a3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hritik Kumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12090559/hritik-kumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570819214,"post_id":58346312,"comment_id":103048675,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345289/how-many-times-will-be-this-statement-will-be-executed/58346312#comment103048675_58346312"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1142,"user_id":6129428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7dab9d0dec9975a9de1237243c42804?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hadi GhahremanNezhad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6129428/hadi-ghahremannezhad"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570819060,"last_edit_date":1570819060,"creation_date":1570816476,"answer_id":58346312,"question_id":58345289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58346312","body_markdown":"In case of time complexity, to be exact:\r\n\r\n - 1 from `p=0;`\r\n - ![dgf](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clceil%7Blogn%7D%5Crceil%20&amp;plus;%201) from the for loop \r\n - ![sgf](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Clceil%7Blogn%7D%5Crceil) from the inside of the loop\r\n\r\nin total it would be:\r\n\r\n![dfh](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2%5Ctimes%5Clceil%7Blogn%7D%5Crceil%20&amp;plus;2)\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nIn case of the value of `p`:\r\n\r\n![fhg](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p%3D%5Clceil%7Blogn%7D%5Crceil)\r\n\r\nto prove this we can say `p` is initially `0` and it is increased as long as `i` is less than `n`.\r\n\r\nIf we assume ![gfh](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?i%3D2%5Ek) , we have `k1` and `k2` before the loop ends:\r\n\r\n![jty](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?2%5E%7Bk1%7D%3Cn%20%5Cleq2%5E%7Bk2%7D)\r\n\r\nso `p` is increased by `1` for `k1` times.

0 : &quot;&quot; );\r\n          }, selector );\r\n          return await this.app.client.setValue( selector, value );\r\n      }\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345266/any-workarounds-for-app-client-setvalue-in-spectron","title":"Any workarounds for app.client.setValue in Spectron?"},{"tags":["java","mongodb","azure-cosmosdb"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11892528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/246b662ab1407252dfc301ffea62d82b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thatgirlwhocodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892528/thatgirlwhocodes"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570818086,"post_id":58345774,"comment_id":103048216,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345263/understanding-mongocollection-updateone/58345774#comment103048216_58345774"},{"owner":{"reputation":1684,"user_id":11717458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n7Wjy36oQKw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reELdECHaKA7ESrLE7eYyYbMnpDxQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SuleymanSah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717458/suleymansah"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11892528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/246b662ab1407252dfc301ffea62d82b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thatgirlwhocodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892528/thatgirlwhocodes"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570818251,"post_id":58345774,"comment_id":103048274,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345263/understanding-mongocollection-updateone/58345774#comment103048274_58345774"},{"owner":{"reputation":1684,"user_id":11717458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n7Wjy36oQKw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reELdECHaKA7ESrLE7eYyYbMnpDxQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SuleymanSah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717458/suleymansah"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11892528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/246b662ab1407252dfc301ffea62d82b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thatgirlwhocodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892528/thatgirlwhocodes"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570818636,"post_id":58345774,"comment_id":103048436,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345263/understanding-mongocollection-updateone/58345774#comment103048436_58345774"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1684,"user_id":11717458,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-n7Wjy36oQKw/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reELdECHaKA7ESrLE7eYyYbMnpDxQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"SuleymanSah","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11717458/suleymansah"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570813883,"creation_date":1570813883,"answer_id":58345774,"question_id":58345263,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58345774","body_markdown":"It finds one document and updates if found, in one hit.\r\n\r\n&gt; db.collection.updateOne() updates the first matching document in the\r\n&gt; collection that matches the filter, using the update instructions to\r\n&gt; apply modifications.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.collection.updateOne/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58345263/understanding-mongocollection-updateone/58345774#58345774","title":"Understanding MongoCollection updateOne"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":11892528,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/246b662ab1407252dfc301ffea62d82b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"thatgirlwhocodes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11892528/thatgirlwhocodes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":744,"user_id":749523,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d509156f201db80c0717771c2eedee1f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Istvan Szasz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/749523/istvan-szasz"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570813883,"creation_date":1570811414,"last_edit_date":1570812970,"question_id":58345263,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58345263","body_markdown":"I have a question regarding `MongoCollection.updateOne(filter,  bson)`. \r\nWhat is the performance of this operation?
