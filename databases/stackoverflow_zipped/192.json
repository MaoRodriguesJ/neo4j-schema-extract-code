Nothing much complicated.\r\n\r\nNow, if I run the server in my local Windows machine, it will start listening to the assigned port and correctly accept requests and send responses.

However, despite following instructions as they are described in the documentation, it seems like the WTOpen call doesn&#39;t set any extension settings.  Using the touch ring after initializing Wintab still triggers the default events, while the default events for pen inputs are suppressed and all pen inputs related to my application instead.\r\n\r\nHere are the relevant segments of code:\r\n```\r\n...\r\n\r\n#include &quot;wintab.h&quot;\r\n#define PACKETDATA (PK_X | PK_Y | PK_Z | PK_NORMAL_PRESSURE | PK_ORIENTATION | PK_TIME | PK_BUTTONS)\r\n#define PACKETMODE 0\r\n#define PACKETTOUCHSTRIP PKEXT_ABSOLUTE\r\n#define PACKETTOUCHRING PKEXT_ABSOLUTE\r\n#include &quot;pktdef.h&quot;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\ninternal b32\r\nInitWinTab(HWND Window, window_mapping *Map)\r\n{\r\n    if(!LoadWintabFunctions())\r\n        return false;\r\n    \r\n    LOGCONTEXT Tablet;\r\n    AXIS TabletX, TabletY, TabletZ, Pressure;\r\n    \r\n    if(!gpWTInfoA(WTI_DEFCONTEXT, 0, &amp;Tablet))\r\n        return false;\r\n    gpWTInfoA(WTI_DEVICES, DVC_X, &amp;TabletX);\r\n    gpWTInfoA(WTI_DEVICES, DVC_Y, &amp;TabletY);\r\n    gpWTInfoA(WTI_DEVICES, DVC_Z, &amp;TabletZ);\r\n    gpWTInfoA(WTI_DEVICES, DVC_NPRESSURE, &amp;Pressure);\r\n    \r\n    UINT TouchStripOffset = 0xFFFF;\r\n    UINT TouchRingOffset = 0xFFFF;\r\n    for(UINT i = 0, ScanTag = 0; gpWTInfoA(WTI_EXTENSIONS + i, EXT_TAG, &amp;ScanTag); i++)\r\n    {\r\n        if (ScanTag == WTX_TOUCHSTRIP)\r\n            TouchStripOffset = i;\r\n        if (ScanTag == WTX_TOUCHRING)\r\n            TouchRingOffset = i;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Tablet.lcOptions |= CXO_MESSAGES;\r\n    Tablet.lcPktData = PACKETDATA;\r\n    Tablet.lcPktMode = PACKETMODE;\r\n    Tablet.lcMoveMask = PACKETDATA;\r\n    Tablet.lcBtnUpMask = Tablet.lcBtnDnMask;\r\n    Tablet.lcInOrgX = 0;\r\n    Tablet.lcInOrgY = 0;\r\n    Tablet.lcInExtX = TabletX.axMax;\r\n    Tablet.lcInExtY = TabletY.axMax;\r\n    \r\n    if(TouchStripOffset != 0xFFFF)\r\n    {\r\n        WTPKT DataMask;\r\n        gpWTInfoA(WTI_EXTENSIONS + TouchStripOffset, EXT_MASK, &amp;DataMask);\r\n        Tablet.lcPktData |= DataMask;\r\n    }\r\n    if(TouchRingOffset != 0xFFFF)\r\n    {\r\n        WTPKT DataMask;\r\n        gpWTInfoA(WTI_EXTENSIONS + TouchRingOffset, EXT_MASK, &amp;DataMask);\r\n        Tablet.lcPktData |= DataMask;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    Map-&gt;AxisMax.x = (r32)TabletX.axMax;\r\n    Map-&gt;AxisMax.y = (r32)TabletY.axMax;\r\n    Map-&gt;AxisMax.z = (r32)TabletZ.axMax;\r\n    Map-&gt;PressureMax = (r32)Pressure.axMax;\r\n    \r\n    if(!gpWTOpenA(Window, &amp;Tablet, TRUE))\r\n        return false;\r\n    \r\n    return(TabletX.axMax &amp;&amp; TabletY.axMax &amp;&amp; TabletZ.axMax &amp;&amp; Pressure.axMax);\r\n}\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\t\tcase WT_PACKET:\r\n        {\r\n            PACKET Packet;\r\n            if(gpWTPacket((HCTX)LParam, (UINT)WParam, &amp;Packet)) \r\n            {\r\n                ...\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t} break;\r\n        \r\n        case WT_PACKETEXT:\r\n        {\r\n            PACKETEXT Packet;\r\n            if(gpWTPacket((HCTX)LParam, (UINT)WParam, &amp;Packet)) \r\n            {\r\n                ...\r\n            }\r\n        } break;\r\n        \r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bitmask for the packet data in the initialization have sensible bits set for both extensions and don&#39;t overlap with the existing bitmask.  No stage of the initialization fails.  WT_PACKET gets called only with valid packet data while WT_PACKETEXT never gets called.  Furthermore, calling WTPacketsGet with a PACKETEXT pointer on the HCTX returned by WTOpen fills the packet with garbage from the regular packet queue.  This leaves me with the conclusion that somehow WTOpen didn&#39;t receive notification that the extensions should be loaded and I&#39;m unable to find what else I should define in the LOGCONTEXT data structure to change that.\r\n\r\nIs there a mistake in my initialization?  Or is there a way to get a better readout to why the extensions didn&#39;t load?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489736/why-i-receive-no-wt-packetext-window-messages-after-initializing-wintab-extensio","title":"Why I receive no WT_PACKETEXT window messages after initializing Wintab extensions?"},{"tags":["javascript","reactjs","react-bootstrap"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6842,"user_id":5734311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7iVq7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chris G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5734311/chris-g"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571672840,"post_id":58489735,"comment_id":103309909,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489735/how-to-halt-rendering-of-dynamic-search-results-in-react#comment103309909_58489735"},{"owner":{"reputation":326,"user_id":5855336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92b648a3d3a88ad6883b626b17b232?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LoF10","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855336/lof10"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6842,"user_id":5734311,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7iVq7.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Chris G","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5734311/chris-g"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571674166,"post_id":58489735,"comment_id":103310591,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489735/how-to-halt-rendering-of-dynamic-search-results-in-react#comment103310591_58489735"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":326,"user_id":5855336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92b648a3d3a88ad6883b626b17b232?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LoF10","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855336/lof10"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571674179,"post_id":58489952,"comment_id":103310600,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489735/how-to-halt-rendering-of-dynamic-search-results-in-react/58489952#comment103310600_58489952"},{"owner":{"reputation":176,"user_id":6939998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d496a4879d9e658734dcf3ca9010fed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mathieu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6939998/mathieu"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":326,"user_id":5855336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92b648a3d3a88ad6883b626b17b232?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LoF10","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855336/lof10"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571674331,"post_id":58489952,"comment_id":103310666,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489735/how-to-halt-rendering-of-dynamic-search-results-in-react/58489952#comment103310666_58489952"},{"owner":{"reputation":326,"user_id":5855336,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bc92b648a3d3a88ad6883b626b17b232?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LoF10","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5855336/lof10"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571675132,"post_id":58489952,"comment_id":103311027,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489735/how-to-halt-rendering-of-dynamic-search-results-in-react/58489952#comment103311027_58489952"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":176,"user_id":6939998,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d496a4879d9e658734dcf3ca9010fed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mathieu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6939998/mathieu"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571673328,"creation_date":1571673328,"answer_id":58489952,"question_id":58489735,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489952","body_markdown":"The simplest way I think you could implement this is in your `handleInputChange`, like so :\r\n```\r\nhandleInputChange = (event) =&gt; {\r\n  event.preventDefault()\r\n  if (event.target.value.length === 0) {\r\n   this.setState({searchInput: &quot;&quot;, showMatches: false, matches: [] })\r\n   return\r\n  }\r\n  this.setState({searchInput: event.target.value })\r\n  this.updateMatches()  \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut what do you mean by &quot;but then as you delete all the way they don&#39;t all go away&quot; ?

That said we can make a change here to help close the file. In your example you never call `a1_filename.close()` so maybe you don&#39;t know that you need to close the file when you are done. To avoid forgetting about this it is best to use a `with open` statement as it will auto close after completion.\r\n\r\nTry this:\r\n\r\n    def return_list():\r\n        a1_filename = &#39;test_file&#39;\r\n        grade = []  # set up main list to be returned before the open statement.\r\n        with open(a1_filename, &#39;r&#39;) as a1_file:  # use with open instead so you properly close file.\r\n            line = a1_file.readline().strip()  # Strip whitespace here before while statement.\r\n            while line != &#39;&#39;:\r\n                temp_list = []  # used to store a list of each word before appending to main list grade.\r\n                for char in line:\r\n                    if char != &#39;\\n&#39;:\r\n                        temp_list.append(char)\r\n                grade.append(temp_list)  # Append temp list to main list.\r\n                line = a1_file.readline()\r\n    \r\n        return grade\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    print(return_list())\r\n\r\nResults:\r\n\r\n    [[&#39;Y&#39;, &#39;o&#39;, &#39;u&#39;, &#39;r&#39;], [&#39;N&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;m&#39;, &#39;e&#39;]]\r\n\r\nIf you would like a short and simple version we can use a fun one liner to clean up the new lines and at the same time generate our list of list.

If you need files to be persisted in scale operations\r\n&gt; or across restarts, you should add this app setting and set it to\r\n&gt; &quot;true&quot;. If you don&#39;t require file persistence, you can set this app\r\n&gt; setting to false.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; The absence of this app setting will result in the setting being\r\n&gt; &quot;true&quot;. In other words, if this app setting does not exist in your\r\n&gt; app, you will see the /home directory mapped to Azure Storage. The app\r\n&gt; setting will be missing if you created your app while Web App for\r\n&gt; Containers was in public preview or if someone has deleted the app\r\n&gt; setting.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Keep in mind that if you enable App Service Storage, when an Azure\r\n&gt; Storage changeover occurs (which does happen periodically), your site\r\n&gt; will restart when the storage volume changes.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Note: If App Service Storage is not enabled, any files written into\r\n&gt; the /home folder will not be persisted across instances (in the case\r\n&gt; of a scale out) or across restarts.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Even if storage persistence is disabled, the /home directory will be\r\n&gt; mapped to Azure Storage in the Kudu (Advanced Tools) container. That\r\n&gt; way, the /home/LogFiles directory will persist between restarts and\r\n&gt; scale out operations in the Kudu container. Therefore, if you need to\r\n&gt; get Docker logs or other logs, always use the Kudu Bash console\r\n&gt; instead of using SSH to access your app&#39;s container.

Then I could do something like\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% assign sorted_posts = paginator.posts | sort: &#39;updated_on&#39; | reverse %}\r\n{% for post in sorted_posts %}\r\n  ... some code here ...\r\n{% endfor %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut I don&#39;t want to go this way since I will have to manually add `updated_on` to each post where it doesn&#39;t already exists.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489689/custom-comparator-for-sorting-arrays-in-liquid-or-jekyll","title":"Custom comparator for sorting arrays in Liquid or Jekyll"},{"tags":["php","jquery","css","ajax"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1059,"user_id":1141944,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4100d16b2367fb136799807312dd9f4e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"tshimkus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1141944/tshimkus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672511,"post_id":58489685,"comment_id":103309744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489685/i-want-to-crop-pdf-file-by-using-php-jquery-ajax#comment103309744_58489685"},{"owner":{"reputation":35290,"user_id":661872,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yqbSi.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Lawrence Cherone","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/661872/lawrence-cherone"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571673292,"post_id":58489685,"comment_id":103310134,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489685/i-want-to-crop-pdf-file-by-using-php-jquery-ajax#comment103310134_58489685"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252431,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Yy078YlJqVU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3red7HuPcyMNSTQfJORJWnGS_L4gtQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Toni Singh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252431/toni-singh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":266712,"user_id":519413,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7839089cd91dc5cc5eb1e0cdbf3312ed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rory McCrossan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/519413/rory-mccrossan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571673768,"answer_count":0,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1571673672,"creation_date":1571672371,"last_edit_date":1571673672,"question_id":58489685,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489685","body_markdown":"I am uploading a PDF file using PHP.

After some googling, I learnt that because of my anaconda installation, it was my .bash_profile that was being used on startup and not .bashrc. This is what my .bash_profile looks like (see below), just adding commands from my .bashrc file (e.g., HISTFILESIZE=100000) to the top of my .bash_profile appears to do nothing.

That&#39;s not enough to reliably interface with blocking code in highly-concurrent system.\r\n\r\n[Documentation states][1] that:\r\n\r\n&gt; Additional threads in this pool are created and are shutdown on\r\n&gt; demand. The number of threads used by this dispatcher is limited by\r\n&gt; the value of “kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism”\r\n&gt; (IO_PARALLELISM_PROPERTY_NAME) system property. It defaults to the\r\n&gt; limit of 64 threads or the number of cores (whichever is larger).\r\n\r\nI want to change `kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism` system property to something else. However, if I just do this:\r\n\r\n    adb shell &quot;setprop kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism 1000&quot;\r\n\r\nthen I get the following result:\r\n\r\n    setprop: failed to set property &#39;kotlinx.coroutines.io.parallelism&#39; to &#39;1000&#39;\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if I want to ship my app, then I&#39;ll need to change this property on users&#39; devices as well, right? Otherwise the app won&#39;t work. However, even assuming that it&#39;s possible, as far as I understand, all apps that change this property will override the setting for one another. This doesn&#39;t sound like a reliable mode of operation.\r\n\r\nSo, I have three questions in this context:\r\n\r\n 1. Is the property implied in documentation is indeed the &quot;system property&quot; that I tried to change?\r\n 2. How to change this property on non-rooted device for all users of my app?\r\n 3. Is there better alternative?\r\n\r\nP.S. I know that if I&#39;d only use coroutines, without blocking code, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem (probably). But let&#39;s just assume that I need to use blocking calls (e.g. legacy Java code).\r\n\r\n  [1]:

Ive tried it with append, but that havent worked for me :-(\r\n\r\n[Here is one exemple signature][1]\r\n\r\n[And here it is how it should looks afterwards with the current date][2]\r\n\r\nIve tried it with this code so far:\r\n\r\n    convert signature.png label:21.10.2019 -gravity West +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\nNow Ive tried it with other order:\r\n\r\n    convert -gravity west label:21.10.2019 signature.png +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\n[But there is only white space before the image added, no text is shown][3]\r\n\r\nIve tried it now with:\r\n\r\n    magick \\( -size 400x -background white -gravity west label:21.10.2019 \\) signature.png +append signature-with-date.png\r\n\r\nStill not working\r\n\r\n[as you can see here][4]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/41gmg.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/YMwE3.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/D9TPO.png\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/1tzDY.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489614/adding-text-before-an-image-using-imagemagick","title":"Adding text before an image using imagemagick"},{"tags":["php","laravel"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2845,"user_id":8034901,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b45dfb2b0d3fc4f241e39ba8bc13ae57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kerbholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8034901/kerbholz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672491,"post_id":58489613,"comment_id":103309731,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel#comment103309731_58489613"},{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10424139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eeb868d5e4cdb706af4433d310a5834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ana bel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10424139/ana-bel"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2845,"user_id":8034901,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b45dfb2b0d3fc4f241e39ba8bc13ae57?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"kerbholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8034901/kerbholz"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672585,"post_id":58489613,"comment_id":103309789,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel#comment103309789_58489613"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10424139,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8eeb868d5e4cdb706af4433d310a5834?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ana bel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10424139/ana-bel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672860,"post_id":58489728,"comment_id":103309928,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489613/question-mark-in-the-url-with-laravel/58489728#comment103309928_58489728"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9438792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EqSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9438792/nick"},"last_editor":{"reputation":64,"user_id":9438792,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/0EqSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9438792/nick"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571672835,"last_edit_date":1571672835,"creation_date":1571672500,"answer_id":58489728,"question_id":58489613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58489728","body_markdown":" You made a mistake in the routing of the template Blade.  \r\n\r\n    {{ route(&#39;blogs_path1&#39;, [&#39;id&#39;

I expect a form with a place to input Buyer Number. As-is, the page works but displays all items and the operator has to manually find each item by buyer number and click the Mark as Paid button. What I need it to do is have an input where it asks for buyer number and only list those items with the mark button at the end. It is a closed-circuit operation so not worried about injections at this time.\r\n\r\nThe line: ``` $sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM consignsold WHERE paid=&#39;n&#39;&quot;; ```\r\nwould be changed to something like: ``` $sql = &quot;SELECT * FROM consignsold WHERE paid=&#39;n&#39; AND buyernumber = &lt;from form input&gt;&quot;;```\r\nSome have asked to clarify. . .

You can rewrite the product router definition like below :\r\n\r\n    const productRouter = [\r\n      {\r\n        path: &#39;:id&#39;,\r\n        name: &#39;ProductDetails&#39;,\r\n        component: ProductDetails\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n\r\nThen, in `ProductList.vue`, you should rewrite your `router-link` as below :\r\n\r\n    &lt;router-link :to=&quot;`/products/${item.id}`&quot;&gt; {{ item.description }} &lt;/router-link&gt;\r\n\r\nFinally, in `ProductPage.vue`, you are missing the `&lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;` needed to render your child routes as explained in the [vue router documentation.][1]. You could rewrite it like below :\r\n\r\n    &lt;template&gt;\r\n      &lt;div id=&quot;productPage&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;h1&gt;This is an Product Page&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;ProductList :items=&quot;products&quot;&gt; &lt;/ProductList&gt;\r\n        &lt;router-view&gt;&lt;/router-view&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/template&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://router.vuejs.org/guide/essentials/nested-routes.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489582/nested-router-with-lazy-load-not-work-propertly/58491269#58491269","title":"nested router with lazy load not work propertly"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":5328540,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/170f13f6878598b276301fa3bc4e8bcf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"john chan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5328540/john-chan"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571678394,"creation_date":1571671995,"question_id":58489582,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58489582","body_markdown":"I am new to Vue and want to navigate `Product` child routes, but it do not work &amp; get `NotFound` page instead. &lt;br&gt;\r\nSo my question is how to make it properly.\r\nOr can someone give some details.

I believe my function could be useful to the community. \r\n\r\nI am trying to sell products that I have in stock, but also allow backorders for the same and other products that my suppliers have in stock. I import the stock qty values for the 2x supplier locations into each product&#39;s custom fields using the Advanced Custom Fields and WP All Import Plugins. \r\n\r\nI then use a maximum quantity plugin to limit how many items can be added to the cart to the combined value of all 3 stock fields. The goal is to not allow adding more to the cart than is available in total.\r\n\r\n    function backorder_autostock($post_id) {\r\n    $stockqty = get_post_meta($post_id, &#39;_stock&#39;, true );\r\n\t$autostocktotal = (get_field(&#39;autostock_cpt&#39;) + get_field(&#39;autostock_jhb&#39;));\r\n\t$maxstockqty = ($stockqty + $autostocktotal);\r\n\tif ( get_field(&#39;autostock_enabled&#39;) == true &amp;&amp; $autostocktotal &gt; 0) {\r\n\t\tupdate_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_wc_max_qty_product&#39;, $maxstockqty);\r\n\t\tupdate_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_backorders&#39;, &#39;notify&#39; );\r\n\t    update_field(&#39;autostock_total&#39;, $autostocktotal, $post_id);\r\n\t}\r\n    else {\r\n        update_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_backorders&#39; , &#39;no&#39; );\r\n\t    update_post_meta($post_id,&#39;_wc_max_qty_product&#39;, &#39;&#39;);\r\n\t     }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    add_action(&#39;acf/save_post&#39;, &#39;backorder_autostock&#39;);\r\n\r\nIts working pretty well, but I have 3 issues: \r\n\r\n1. $stockqty gets reduced when the order is placed, but $autostocktotal (backorder availibility qty) does not get reduced because it is not a native stock qty field.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\n$stockqty = 1 and $autostocktotal = 6. \r\nCustomer orders 2x items. \r\nNow $stockqty = 0 but $autostocktotal still = 6\r\n\r\n2. The _wc_max_qty_product also does not get reduced so the maximum add to cart plugin still allows for all 7 units. (This is because of the function hook only triggering when the product is saved/updated, but not when a order is placed)\r\n\r\n3. Even if I was able to solve the above issues, I will also need the quantities for products in pending orders to be reduced from future updated $stockqty and $autostocktotal values because the system that exports the values to update these fields will not be accurate if the orders are not processed yet.\r\n\r\nIs there a practical way to get around the issues? \r\n\r\nI have been all over the web looking for an out-of-box solution to just have a dedicated field that behaves like _stock , but just for backorder stock.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489581/woocommerce-backorder-stock-manage","title":"Woocommerce Backorder Stock Manage"},{"tags":["java","spring","git","spring-boot","testing"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571672149,"post_id":58489580,"comment_id":103309551,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push#comment103309551_58489580"},{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6304206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bxeU_Wvk3RQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABAE/WUQH4BtsS-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EnzoMolion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6304206/enzomolion"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":59305,"user_id":2541560,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7H9TF.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kayaman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2541560/kayaman"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571673046,"post_id":58489580,"comment_id":103310011,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push#comment103310011_58489580"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":33,"user_id":6304206,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bxeU_Wvk3RQ/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABAE/WUQH4BtsS-I/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"EnzoMolion","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6304206/enzomolion"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571737893,"post_id":58490316,"comment_id":103331826,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58489580/how-to-run-my-spring-tests-before-every-commit-push/58490316#comment103331826_58490316"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":286,"user_id":8045100,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/81f4636246f02f7b275cb3c958c5b768?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Frank Hopkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8045100/frank-hopkins"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571674678,"creation_date":1571674678,"answer_id":58490316,"question_id":58489580,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58490316","body_markdown":"You can use any (bash) script as a git pre-commit or pre-push hook.

am working in a java jpa Hibernate-search application, I know Hibernate-search index automatically every @Id annotation in an entity. The problem is that I have a &quot;master domain&quot; class with contains the @Id annotation, and then I have another class with inherit &quot;master domain&quot;, then seems to be the Hibernate search is not recognizing the @Id field inherited.\r\n\r\nthis is my master domain class.\r\n```\r\n@MappedSuperclass\r\n@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)\r\npublic abstract class MasterDomain&lt;Key extends Object&gt; implements Serializable\r\n{\r\n    @Id\r\n    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)\r\n    private Key id;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have a class &quot;Language&quot; which inherits this class:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@Indexed\r\n@Entity\r\npublic class Language extends MasterDomain&lt;Long&gt;{\r\n\r\n    @Field\r\n    private String name;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally I have another class called &quot;LanguageRelation&quot; which is related with Language class.
