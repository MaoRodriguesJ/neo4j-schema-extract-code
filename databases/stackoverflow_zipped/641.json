However, there is a possible reason for the presented results.\r\n\r\nIf I didn&#39;t miscalculate, you are using a **dense** 1000x300 matrix, which is an array of 300.000 floating-point numbers.\r\n\r\nFrom this line\r\n\r\n~~~ Matlab\r\n2.062  37500000     21         val=grid(i, j);\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nyou can calculate that a single execution takes around 55 nanoseconds (time / calls * 10^9) which is quite a lot for a simple data-access. If you have a 2GHz Processor, a processing cycle takes 0,5 nanoseconds. That would be 110 cycles. However, since you are using a huge dense matrix you are probably facing a lot of cache misses here. To be sure, reduce the matrix size drastically (start with 40x12) and calculate the time per execution. It should get down to around 1-2 nanoseconds if you have a cache miss problem.\r\n\r\nIn case cache misses are truly the problem, I fear there is not really an easy solution to your problem since it requires reorganization of your data in a memory friendly manner. The fact that Matlab is a scripting language doesn&#39;t make it easier because you have no compiler that performs optimizations for you.  You can try switching the inner and outer loop and hope that the memory access pattern gets better.\r\n\r\nGreetings","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388944/access-matrix-element-in-condition/58390238#58390238","title":"Access matrix element in condition"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":312,"user_id":3616601,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9dbe1da7416f8fa9b0cf1d0974269e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Phantom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3616601/phantom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571208382,"post_id":58398402,"comment_id":103158569,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388944/access-matrix-element-in-condition/58398402#comment103158569_58398402"},{"owner":{"reputation":30015,"user_id":7328782,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/treJu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cris Luengo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328782/cris-luengo"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":312,"user_id":3616601,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9dbe1da7416f8fa9b0cf1d0974269e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Phantom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3616601/phantom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571209200,"post_id":58398402,"comment_id":103158963,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388944/access-matrix-element-in-condition/58398402#comment103158963_58398402"},{"owner":{"reputation":312,"user_id":3616601,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":89,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9dbe1da7416f8fa9b0cf1d0974269e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Phantom","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3616601/phantom"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571209381,"post_id":58398402,"comment_id":103159063,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388944/access-matrix-element-in-condition/58398402#comment103159063_58398402"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30015,"user_id":7328782,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/treJu.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Cris Luengo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7328782/cris-luengo"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571154278,"creation_date":1571154278,"answer_id":58398402,"question_id":58388944,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58398402","body_markdown":"&gt; getting the value of the cell take as much time as getting it twice and compare it to two values.

For this I use the [MatLab profiler][1].\r\n\r\nIn some functions I was in the same situation. I loop over a grid (a 2D matrix) and I test if each cell has (or not) some values (two each time). And the condition takes a long time. Most of the time spends in those functions.\r\n\r\nHere is an example from my code:\r\n\r\n      time      Calls    line\r\n                          16   function tGrid=some_compute(grid, tGrid, trans)\r\n      0.005       125     17     global depth width tWidth \r\n                          18\r\n    &lt; 0.001       125     19     for i=1:depth \r\n      0.022    125000     20       for j=1:width \r\n      2.270  37500000     21         if (grid(i, j)~=0 &amp;&amp; grid(i, j)~=1) \r\n                          22\r\n                          23           % Get the transformed coordinates of the current cell\r\n      0.864     79997     24           [x, y]=get_trans(trans, i, j); \r\n                          25\r\n      0.006     79997     26           if (x~=-1 &amp;&amp; y~=-1) \r\n      0.006     79992     27             tGrid(x, y)=grid(i, j); \r\n      0.004     79992     28           end % If x~=-1 &amp;&amp; y~=-1 \r\n      0.004     79997     29         end % If grid~=0 &amp;&amp; grid~=1 \r\n      1.933  37500000     30       end % For j=width \r\n      0.008    125000     31     end % For i=depth \r\n                          32\r\n    &lt; 0.001       125     33   end\r\n\r\n\r\nThis function takes a total of 5.24s for 125 calls.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, it&#39;s the line 21 who take the more time to execute. While the the `grid(i, j)` is accessed twice in the condition, and is also used in line 27, I guessed by storing it in a variable before, it will speed-up my code.\r\n\r\nSo, I did this simple modification:\r\n\r\n      time      Calls    line\r\n                          16   function tGrid=some_compute(grid, tGrid, trans)\r\n      0.005       125     17     global depth width tWidth\r\n                          18\r\n    &lt; 0.001       125     19     for i=1:depth\r\n      0.021    125000     20       for j=1:width\r\n      2.062  37500000     21         val=grid(i, j);\r\n      1.681  37500000     22         if (val~=0 &amp;&amp; val~=1)\r\n                          23\r\n                          24           % Get the transformed coordinates of the current cell\r\n      0.793     79997     25           [x, y]=get_trans(trans, i, j);\r\n                          26\r\n      0.005     79997     27           if (x~=-1 &amp;&amp; y~=-1)\r\n      0.005     79992     28             tGrid(x, y)=val;\r\n      0.004     79992     29           end % If x~=-1 &amp;&amp; y~=-1\r\n      0.004     79997     30         end % If grid~=0 &amp;&amp; grid~=1\r\n      1.731  37500000     31       end % For j=width\r\n      0.007    125000     32     end % For i=depth\r\n                          33\r\n    &lt; 0.001       125     34   end\r\n\r\nAnd now, this function takes a total of 6.32s for 125 calls.\r\n\r\nAs we can see, getting the value of the cell take as much time as getting it twice and compare it to two values. And the if, line 22, is as much slow as in the first version.

After digging on the internet, I came to know that I need to change this port on &quot;rabbitmq.config&quot; file. But the problem is, that I was unable to find this file anywhere on my mac.\r\n\r\nSo, for Plan B, I stopped Active MQ, and was able to start Rabbit MQ successfully. And then, I changed the following ports in &lt;activemq-install-dir&gt;/conf/activemq.xml,\r\n\r\n    &lt;transportConnectors&gt;\r\n                    &lt;!-- DOS protection, limit concurrent

61617;\r\nfor amqp, changed port from 5672 to 5673;\r\nfor stomp, changed port from 61613 to 61615\r\n\r\nNow when I try to start Active MQ, I get the following,\r\n\r\n    Rishavs-MacBook-Pro:bin

about Auth in Firebase Real-time Database\r\n\r\nHello everyone, in these days I made my first app in flutter that reads from a real-time Firebase database a list of data (cars info, because it’s a car catalog read from the main website).\r\nIn this moment database is in test mode, so read and write are set to true. \r\nI want that who downloaded app can read all cars list without sign in, so in this case I have to leave the read property with true value and the write one with false value ?\r\nOr there is another better way to authorise people to read list without sign in, maybe with a key or other I don’t know.\r\nThank you very much who read all the message ☺️","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388903/info-about-auth-in-firebase-realtime-database","title":"Info about Auth in

I create direct byte buffer in jni using NewDirectByteBuffer function, I found it&#39;s time-consuming. I print a flame graph:\r\n[![NewDirectByteBuffer flame graph][1]][1]\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Ju7P3.png\r\n\r\nThis is unacceptable in my situation, I need to call it frequently in a streaming data processing scene. In order to avoid this overhead, I pass a DirectByteBuffer to jni, and set address/capacity fields in jni.\r\nHere&#39;s simplified code:\r\n\r\nJava:\r\n```\r\n  public ByteBuffer getBuffer() {\r\n    ByteBuffer buf = buffer.duplicate();\r\n    getBufferNative(nativePtr, buf);\r\n    buf.clear(); // set position to 0, limit to capacity\r\n    return buf;\r\n  }\r\n  private ByteBuffer buffer = Platform.wrapDirectBuffer(0, 0);// time-consuming with reflection\r\n  private native void getBufferNative(long nativePtr, ByteBuffer buffer);\r\n```\r\nJNI:\r\n```\r\nJNIEXPORT void JNICALL\r\nJava_ReaderImpl_getBufferNative(\r\n    JNIEnv *env, jobject, jlong nativePtr, jobject direct_buffer) {\r\n    // get buffer from network\r\n  Buffer &amp;buffer = ...\r\n  env-&gt;SetLongField(direct_buffer, java_direct_buffer_address,\r\n                    reinterpret_cast&lt;jlong&gt;(buffer.Data()));\r\n  env-&gt;SetIntField(direct_buffer, java_direct_buffer_capacity, buffer.Size());\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has better performance, but still three jni calls.

just started with HTML and CSS and am obviously still learning the basics. I am running into an issue I do not understand and hope you can provide me with some insight:\r\n\r\nThe problem I have is that any element I create in HTML / CSS always are rendered at the top left of the screen, in this example I created 2 &lt;div&gt;s and assigned them a size of 200 x 200 px in CSS, display: block. I specified no other values other than a background color to make them visible. \r\n\r\nMy expected outcome is that div 1 would be in the top left corner of the screen with div 2 beginning just underneath div 1. However, both occupy t5he same space. \r\n\r\nHowever I understood that a block-level element always starts on a new line. So what am I missing?\r\n\r\nI know I can enter a custom position div 2 but I also know that shouldn&#39;t be necessary: it should automatically start a new line without any further inputs. \r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what I have, the most basic experiment:\r\n\r\nHTML \r\n\r\n    `&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\r\n    &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;./test.css&quot;&gt;\r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container2&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/body&gt;\r\n    &lt;/html&gt;`\r\n\r\nCSS\r\n\r\n    .container1 {\r\n    display: block;\r\n    height: 200px;\r\n    width: 200px;\r\n    background-color: blue;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .container1 {\r\n    display: block;\r\n    height: 200px;\r\n    width: 200px;\r\n    background-color: crimson;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI understand that by default both divs should be assigned the block attribute by default and with that, each block should start in a new line. \r\nBut they do not. Container2 will overlap container1.

Just go with the Native stuff. \r\n\r\n  - It is much better for the user as stuff are the same through all the apps and it is easier. \r\n  - When something is custom it means more code. More code means more time. More code means more bugs. More code means more something that you need to read and manage in the future. Like Winnie the Pooh would say: More is more and less is less. In our case: More code is more headache. \r\n  - When something is not custom, it means that you are using the Android API which is evolving. Which means that your app will always be new and it will not get old, because the Android Project updates their code and we as developers need to change the version of the API. If something that looks cool was implemented by us, in 1 year it might not look that cool and the only way to change it is by reimplementing it. \r\n  - The same problems arises if we try to reuse code by using some external library on Github. In short term it will work well as we are &quot;reusing code&quot;, which in programming is good, but in 3 years, the library will be deprecated and you will have to use something else. At the moment I am deleting such libraries from my project. \r\n \r\n\r\nSo what you can do:\r\n\r\n - Learn the good design principles for each platform and try to reuse what is out of the box. Then if you really want something else you should really be aware what is the price of it! \r\n - When you try to evaluate the price, please look where are you working. Yes, everybody wants this amazing design, but are your company really willing to pay for it? Really? What resources it has? If the app has shitty functionality the looks won&#39;t matter. If you take too much time of the developers to create custom things it will affect the code. Also custom thins which will be hard to support long term. \r\n - Also developers tend to think that the UI people are in general idiots who just don&#39;t understand their needs and tend to whatever they want. Don&#39;t be the idiot. Stand your ground if you think you are right, but don&#39;t you ever agree on something with the developer and then do something else in the mockups.\r\n\r\nAlso maybe you can look a little bit through the API yourself.

Basically, the principle is to lock an global object before printing and release it when you finish with printing, so that other thread can access it and successively lock it and do the printing itself. Here&#39;s one of the examples (taken from [bogotobogo.com][1]):\r\n\r\n    import threading\r\n    import time\r\n    import logging\r\n    import random\r\n    \r\n    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,\r\n                        format=&#39;(%(threadName)-9s) %(message)s&#39;,)\r\n                        \r\n    class Counter(object):\r\n        def __init__(self, start = 0):\r\n            self.lock = threading.Lock()\r\n            self.value = start\r\n        def increment(self):\r\n            logging.debug(&#39;Waiting for a lock&#39;)\r\n            self.lock.acquire()\r\n            try:\r\n                logging.debug(&#39;Acquired a lock&#39;)\r\n                self.value = self.value + 1\r\n            finally:\r\n                logging.debug(&#39;Released a lock&#39;)\r\n                self.lock.release()\r\n    \r\n    def worker(c):\r\n        for i in range(2):\r\n            r = random.random()\r\n            logging.debug(&#39;Sleeping %0.02f&#39;, r)\r\n            time.sleep(r)\r\n            c.increment()\r\n        logging.debug(&#39;Done&#39;)\r\n    \r\n    if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;:\r\n        counter = Counter()\r\n        for i in range(2):\r\n            t = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(counter,))\r\n            t.start()\r\n    \r\n        logging.debug(&#39;Waiting for worker threads&#39;)\r\n        main_thread = threading.currentThread()\r\n        for t in threading.enumerate():\r\n            if t is not main_thread:\r\n                t.join()\r\n        logging.debug(&#39;Counter: %d&#39;, counter.value)\r\n\r\nUPDATE:\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you are not asking about locking threads, then actually manipulating the output of two independent scripts, concept is quite the same, except you can use lock file for that purpose. Lets say you have two pretty similar scripts:\r\nFirst one:\r\n\r\n    import os.path\r\n    \r\n    while(os.path.exists(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;)):\r\n            continue\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    f = open(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.write(&quot;Hi2\\n&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.write(&quot;There2\\n&quot;)\r\n    f.close()\r\n    os.remove(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.close()\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd another one:\r\n \r\n\r\n    import os.path\r\n    \r\n    while(os.path.exists(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;)):\r\n            continue\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    f = open(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;, &quot;w+&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output = open(&quot;output.txt&quot;, &quot;a&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.write(&quot;Hi1\\n&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.write(&quot;There1\\n&quot;)\r\n    f.close()\r\n    os.remove(&quot;lock.LCK&quot;)\r\n    file_for_output.close()\r\n\r\nIf you would run those 2 files at a same time, 1 would have to wait until other one finishes the writing, because of the lock file protection in dead while loop. Please note that this is only basic example how this issue can be handled. If you would like to implement this in the real code, I really advise setting up the timeout limit for the dead loop and proper exceptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/Multithread/python_multithreading_Synchronization_Lock_Objects_Acquire_Release.php","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388849/how-to-force-python-commands-to-run-together-before-context-switch/58389031#58389031","title":"How to force python commands to run together before context switch?"}],"owner":{"reputation":7347,"user_id":3512538,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Om7A.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CIsForCookies","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3512538/cisforcookies"},"last_editor":{"reputation":7347,"user_id":3512538,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6Om7A.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"CIsForCookies","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3512538/cisforcookies"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":40,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571128655,"creation_date":1571122522,"last_edit_date":1571122826,"question_id":58388849,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58388849","body_markdown":"I have 2 processes running, and each is printing a config file it owns.

Proc ??: print_conf()\r\n\r\nHow can I combine the prints, so I will see the print(proc_name) and immediately after the print_conf?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388849/how-to-force-python-commands-to-run-together-before-context-switch","title":"How to force python commands to run together before context switch?"},{"tags":["laravel","symlink"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":174,"user_id":1882752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cc76f24183982b76932ae7b68be033b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1882752","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1882752/user1882752"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571123408,"post_id":58389063,"comment_id":103124883,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388848/laravel-trying-to-access-storage-gives-forbidden-error/58389063#comment103124883_58389063"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":30,"user_id":10321719,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mF_qhzPSxb0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAoc/Hpki-2U-jzY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Kneegrows","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10321719/kneegrows"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571123352,"creation_date":1571123352,"answer_id":58389063,"question_id":58388848,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58389063","body_markdown":"Did you check what directory permissions you have in there? make sure its 755 or 777.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388848/laravel-trying-to-access-storage-gives-forbidden-error/58389063#58389063","title":"Laravel - trying to access storage gives forbidden error"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":174,"user_id":1882752,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3cc76f24183982b76932ae7b68be033b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1882752","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1882752/user1882752"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571135216,"creation_date":1571135216,"answer_id":58392515,"question_id":58388848,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58392515","body_markdown":"Stupid me.

The jQuery I&#39;m using to loop through the data is as below (Placed comments against relavent statements below):\r\n\r\n````\r\njQuery(&#39;.divResult table tbody tr td&#39;).each(function ($) {\r\n    if (jQuery(this).text() == &#39;Options&#39;) jQuery(this).nextAll(&quot;td&quot;).each(function () {\r\n        var data = jQuery(this).text();\r\n        var Options = data.split(&#39;/&#39;);\r\n\r\n        function HowToReach(data) {\r\n            var html = &#39;&lt;table class=&quot;InnerTable&quot;&gt;&#39;;\r\n            jQuery.each(Options, function(index, value){\r\n                var OptionNumber = value.split(&#39;-&#39;)[0];\r\n                var OptionData = value.split(&#39;-&#39;)[1];\r\n                var OptionColor = OptionData.split(&#39;,&#39;)[0];\r\n                var OptionTransport = OptionData.split(&#39;,&#39;)[1];\r\n                var OptionTransportArray = OptionTransport.split(&#39;&amp;&#39;); // &lt;-- Splitting the transport options\r\n                \r\n                for (i=0; i&lt;OptionTransportArray.length; i++){\r\n                  var OptionTransportEach = OptionTransport.split(&#39;&amp;&#39;)[i]; // &lt;-- Looping the options\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                html += &#39;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#39;+ OptionNumber +&#39;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#39;\r\n                html += &#39;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Color:&#39;+ OptionColor +&#39;&lt;/td&gt;&#39;\r\n                html += &#39;&lt;td&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fas fa-&#39;+OptionTransportEach+&#39;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&#39;

Going through the documentation, there is a lot ASP.NET Web Api concepts I do not fully understand or have experience with, making it a bit difficult to determine what is missing from my implementation.\r\n\r\nI want to apply Autofac to an existing ASP.NET Web Api project that has several ApiControllers. These controllers all share a parent abstract class. This abstract class has a method that is responsible for returning an instance of a service. I hoped to replace this method with Autofac&#39;s dependency injection.\r\n\r\nThe parent abstract class from which every ApiController inherits, is very simple.\r\n```lang-cs\r\npublic abstract class BaseApiController\r\n{\r\n\tpublic IMyService serviceClient { get; set; }\r\n\r\n\tpublic BaseApiController() {}\r\n\r\n\tpublic BaseApiController(IMyService serviceClient)\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tthis.serviceClient = serviceClient;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery controller inherits from the above class, while some employs a default Get method, most have multiple routes. Not a single controller is specifying a constructor:\r\n```lang-cs\r\npublic class MyController : BaseApiController\r\n{\r\n\tpublic MyController() : base() {}\r\n\tpublic MyController(IMyService serviceClient) : base(serviceClient) {}\r\n\r\n\t[HttpGet]\r\n\t[Route(&quot;api/foo/bar&quot;)]\r\n\t[ActionName(&quot;FooBar&quot;)]\r\n\tpublic string FooBar()\r\n\t{\r\n\t\tusing (serviceClient)\r\n\t\t{\r\n\t\t\treturn serviceClient.GetFooBar() as string;\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAutofac is integrated into the Application_Start method of the applications Glabal.asax.cs, registering the ServerClientProvider which should be the provider that should be resolved to when a dependency to the IMyService is encountered:\r\n```lang-cs\r\npublic class Global : System.Web.HttpApplication, IContainerProviderAccessor\r\n{\r\n\t#region AutoFac\r\n\tprivate static IContainerProvider _containerProvider;\r\n\r\n\tpublic IContainerProvider ContainerProvider =&gt; _containerProvider;\r\n\t#endregion AutoFac\r\n\r\n\tprotected void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n\t{\r\n\r\n\t\tvar builder = new ContainerBuilder();\r\n\r\n\t\tbuilder.Register(x =&gt; ServiceClientProvider.GetServiceClient())\r\n            .As&lt;IMyService&gt;()\r\n            .InstancePerRequest();\r\n\r\n\t\tbuilder.RegisterApiControllers(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()).PropertiesAutowired();\r\n\t\tbuilder.RegisterHubs(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()).PropertiesAutowired();\r\n\r\n        var container = builder.Build();\r\n\r\n        GlobalConfiguration.Configuration.DependencyResolver = new AutofacWebApiDependencyResolver(container);\r\n        GlobalHost.DependencyResolver = new AutofacDependencyResolver(container);\r\n\r\n        _containerProvider = new ContainerProvider(container);\r\n\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have configured the ASP.NET application, in the web.config:\r\n```lang-xml\r\n&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n  &lt;system.webServer&gt;\r\n    &lt;modules runAllManagedModulesForAllRequests=&quot;true&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;add name=&quot;ContainerDisposal&quot; type=&quot;Autofac.Integration.Web.ContainerDisposalModule, Autofac.Integration.Web&quot; preCondition=&quot;managedHandler&quot; /&gt;\r\n      &lt;add name=&quot;PropertyInjection&quot; type=&quot;Autofac.Integration.Web.Forms.PropertyInjectionModule, Autofac.Integration.Web&quot; preCondition=&quot;managedHandler&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/modules&gt;\r\n  &lt;/system.webServer&gt;\r\n&lt;configuration&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, Autofac should automatically resolve the provider when encountering a controller with a public property that matches the registered type (Property Injection), or if a constructor exists with a parameter that matches any registered dependency.\r\n\r\nHowever, I&#39;m not getting any errors relating to my Autofac configuration. I&#39;m getting a NullReferenceException when the `MyController` attempt to call the `IMyService.FooBar` method.\r\n\r\nWhat am I missing?\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388778/autofac-resolving-dependencies-for-apicontrollers","title":"Autofac: Resolving dependencies for ApiControllers"},{"tags":["python","udp"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":57561,"user_id":1832058,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/relWs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"furas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1832058/furas"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571122529,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103124466,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103124466_58388777"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571123113,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103124745,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103124745_58388777"},{"owner":{"reputation":270566,"user_id":207421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5cfe5f7d64f44be04f147295f5c7b88e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user207421","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/207421/user207421"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571123389,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103124872,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103124872_58388777"},{"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":11430953,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ocfQ2IF-Ll4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAhE/Hghb3gr6XRM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"pok fung Chan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11430953/pok-fung-chan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571125046,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103125738,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103125738_58388777"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8631171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2464e1dd93758a17d15eabef663c0ec3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LingnerPoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8631171/lingnerpoi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571128720,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103127648,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103127648_58388777"},{"owner":{"reputation":6416,"user_id":1358308,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":56,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d9448dee25fd2278def77cb7f0353574?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Sam Mason","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1358308/sam-mason"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571339299,"post_id":58388777,"comment_id":103218237,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388777/is-there-a-way-to-send-large-files-over-udp#comment103218237_58388777"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8631171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2464e1dd93758a17d15eabef663c0ec3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LingnerPoi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8631171/lingnerpoi"},"comment_count":6,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571122257,"creation_date":1571122257,"question_id":58388777,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58388777","body_markdown":"I had just started learning network programming using Python. Currently working on homework that request using UDP to send files over from client to server then back to the client. However, my codes work fine with small files but had problems with larger files.\r\n\r\nI had found a way of using import os to find out the size of the file. So I am thinking about to split up the file if it is bigger then the maximum size that UDP can send, and send the split-up file one by one.\r\n\r\nBut then I am not sure what is the maximum size that UDP can send, and how could I build all the split parts back together when sending over?\r\n\r\n    // Client side\r\n\r\n    import os\r\n    from socket import *\r\n\r\n    //Set up information of server\r\n    server_name = &#39;127.0.0.1&#39;  # 127.0.0.1 is local IP\r\n    server_port = 12000\r\n    clientSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM)\r\n\r\n    //Request the location of file\r\n    foundFile = 0\r\n    while foundFile == 0:\r\n        print(&quot;========================================&quot;)\r\n        print(&quot;[Please input the path of the file you wish to transmit.]&quot;)\r\n        path = input(&quot;[Path]: &quot;)\r\n        print(&quot;========================================&quot;)\r\n\r\n    if os.path.isfile(path):\r\n        print(&quot;[File found.]&quot;)\r\n\r\n        fileSize = os.path.getsize(path)\r\n        print(&quot;[File size is : &quot;, fileSize, &#39;bits]&#39;)\r\n\r\n        print(&quot;[Starting file transmission.]&quot;)\r\n        foundFile = 1\r\n    else:\r\n        print(&quot;[File not found.] Please re-enter the correct path.&quot;)\r\n        print(&quot;[Please choose only on file, or enter the correct path.]&quot;)\r\n        foundFile = 0\r\n\r\n    fileOpen = open(path, &#39;rb&#39;)\r\n    file = fileOpen.read()\r\n    clientSocket.sendto(file, (server_name, server_port))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, if the file is small, it should send over to the server-side.

You should then *probably* rather first get the HTTP response and figure out the total size before you hand that data on using that second protocol that needs the size upfront!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388748/is-there-a-way-to-get-the-content-length-from-an-http-header-using-libcurl-7-3/58430117#58430117","title":"Is there a way to get the content-length from an HTTP header using libcurl &gt;=7.3.x?"}],"owner":{"reputation":134,"user_id":10981932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Icgqz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"AOrona","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10981932/aorona"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571307136,"creation_date":1571122124,"question_id":58388748,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58388748","body_markdown":"I am using the libcurl library to receive an HTTP request.

The idea is to subclass the `QPushButton` and reimplement `keyPressEvent()`.\r\n\r\nThis may look as follows:\r\n\r\n_.h_\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;QPushButton&gt;\r\n\r\nclass MyQPushButton final : public QPushButton\r\n{\r\n    Q_OBJECT\r\n\r\n    public:\r\n        MyQPushButton(const QIcon icon, const QString &amp; text, QWidget * parent = nullptr);\r\n        MyQPushButton(const QString &amp; text, QWidget * parent = nullptr);\r\n        MyQPushButton(QWidget * parent = nullptr);\r\n\r\n    protected:\r\n        void keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent * e) override;\r\n};\r\n```\r\n_.cpp_\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;QKeyEvent&gt;\r\n\r\nMyQPushButton::MyQPushButton(const QIcon icon, const QString &amp; text, QWidget * parent) : QPushButton(icon, text, parent)\r\n{}\r\nMyQPushButton::MyQPushButton(const QString &amp; text, QWidget * parent) : QPushButton(text, parent)\r\n{}\r\nMyQPushButton::MyQPushButton(QWidget * parent) : QPushButton(parent)\r\n{}\r\n\r\nvoid MyQPushButton::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent * e)\r\n{\r\n    if(e-&gt;key() == Qt::Key_Return &amp;&amp; (e-&gt;modifiers() &amp; Qt::ControlModifier))\r\n        click();\r\n    else\r\n        e-&gt;ignore();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis way, the &lt;kbd&gt;Space&lt;/kbd&gt; event is not handled anymore and the &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; will run the `click()` function.&lt;br/&gt;\r\n**I have tested it and it worked successfully.**\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve written this example as simple as possible. Of course, feel free to adapt it to  best fit your needs.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want it to work with the numpad &lt;kbd&gt;Enter&lt;/kbd&gt; key too, you can catch `Qt::Key_Enter` too.

method name you call on the client must be the same as in your SignalR Hub (with the exception that lowercase methods are also allowed).\r\n\r\nSince your Hub method is called `Send1` and your client calls `Send`, the method is not found. To fix the issue you can rename your Hub method to `Send` or change your client code to call `this._hubConnection.invoke(&#39;send1&#39;, &quot;hey&quot;, &quot;ho&quot;)`.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what you do:\r\n\r\n* `this._hubConnection.on(&quot;Send&quot;, ...` have the client listen for a server event called `Send`.\r\n\r\n* `this._hubConnection.invoke(&#39;Send&#39;, &quot;hey&quot;)` invoke a server method called `Send`. THIS DOES NOT EXIST! the server method is called `Send1`!\r\n\r\n* `public async Task Send1( string message1, string Root)` declare a method called `Send1`. nowhere in your client you are you trying to invoke `Send1`, only `Send` (without `1`).\r\n\r\n* `await Clients.All.SendAsync(&quot;Send1&quot;, message1);` if `Send1` would be invoked, you&#39;d try to publish a `Send1` message to all clients. no client is listening for `Send1` though, only for `Send`.\r\n\r\nNow look at your error message: `Failed to invoke hub method &#39;Send&#39;.` it&#39;s looking for a hub method `Send` but it does not exist, because you called it `Send1` instead.\r\n\r\nQuick Fix: Simply rename all occurrences of `Send1` to `Send`. Because that&#39;s what you are trying to invoke on your client. In Addition, you also have to call it using 2 arguments, not one like currently, since the hub method has 2 parameters.

But I belive the defaults are good enough for now.\r\n\r\n### Step 2\r\n\r\nYour hub class can simply just inherit from : Hub for a test to work. But to show some consol output, you can override virtual Hub functions like this:\r\n\r\n   &lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    public class YourHubClass: Hub\r\n    {\r\n        public override async Task OnConnectedAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(Context.ConnectionId);\r\n            await base.OnConnectedAsync();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public override async Task OnDisconnectedAsync(Exception ex)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(Context.ConnectionId);            \r\n            await base.OnDisconnectedAsync(ex);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n### Step 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDepending on when/where in you back-end code you want to notify all clients (or specific clients) that are listening to you hub, you can simply emit the data you want to transfer by doing something like this.\r\n\r\n   &lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    var test1data = GetTest1Data();\r\n    await _hub.Clients.All.SendAsync(&quot;test1&quot;, test1data);\r\n\r\n    var test2data = GetTest1Data();\r\n    await _hub.Clients.All.SendAsync(&quot;test2&quot;, test2data);\r\n\r\nWhere `_hub` is dependency injected in this scope. Just to clarify that:\r\n\r\n   &lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    private readonly IHubContext&lt;YourHubClass&gt; _hub;\r\n    \r\n    public YourScopedConstructor(IHubContext&lt;YourHubClass&gt; hub) \r\n    {\r\n        _hub = hub ?? throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(hub));\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n### Step 4\r\n\r\nNow you can connect and listen to your hub. E.g:\r\n\r\n &lt;!-- language: lang-ts --&gt;\r\n\r\n    public yourSubscribableSubject: BehaviorSubject&lt;any&gt; = new BehaviorSubject&lt;any&gt;(null);\r\n    private _baseUrl: string = &quot;your base url&quot;;\r\n    private _frontendHubConnection: HubConnection;\r\n\r\n    this._frontendHubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()\r\n            .withUrl(`${this._baseUrl}/hub/test1`) // or hub/test2\r\n            .configureLogging(LogLevel.Information)\r\n            .build();\r\n\r\n    this._frontendHubConnection\r\n            .start()\r\n            .then(() =&gt; console.log(&#39;SignalR - init&#39;))\r\n            .catch(err =&gt; console.log(&#39;Error while starting connection: &#39; + err));\r\n\r\n     this._frontendHubConnection.on(&#39;test1&#39;, (data: any) =&gt; {\r\n            console.log(data);\r\n            this.yourSubscribableSubject.next(data);\r\n        });\r\n\r\nAnd for any other component to get the data, just subscribe to `yourSubscribableSubject`. Hopefully it helps.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you want to trigger the data to be sent from server to clients from the API endpoint, just move the scoped code i suggested from step 3.\r\n\r\n   &lt;!-- language: c# --&gt;\r\n\r\n    public async Task&lt;ActionResult&gt; YourApiRoute()\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            var test1data = GetTest1Data();\r\n            await _hub.Clients.All.SendAsync(&quot;test1&quot;, test1data);\r\n            return Ok();\r\n        }\r\n        catch (Exception e)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(e.Message);\r\n            return StatusCode(StatusCodes.Status500InternalServerError);\r\n        }\r\n     }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58388739/failed-to-invoke-signalr/58389514#58389514","title":"Failed to invoke signalR"}],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user8065212"},"last_editor":{"reputation":334,"user_id":10581132,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bRn4t.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kiril1512","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10581132/kiril1512"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58389255,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571171222,"creation_date":1571122091,"last_edit_date":1571171222,"question_id":58388739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58388739","body_markdown":"I am trying to send notification to My client(Angular) from .net core server(c#) using signalR. to notify client when the event is fired.
