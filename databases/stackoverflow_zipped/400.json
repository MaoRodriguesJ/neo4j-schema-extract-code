See the [Python documentation][1] for more info about Classes in Python. For more info about `sklearn` in particular, take a look at this [sklearn documentation][2].\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a short description of how you are using Classes in `sklearn`.\r\n\r\nFirst you instantiate your `sklearn` Classes with `sc_X = StandardScaler()` or `missingvalues = SimpleImputer(...)`.\r\n\r\nThe objects, `sc_X` and `missingvalues`, each have methods. You can use the methods typing `object_name.method_name(...)`.  For example, you used the `fit_transform()` method of the `sc_X` instance when you typed, `sc_X.fit_transform(...)`. This method will take your data and return a scaled version of it. It both `fit`s (determines the scaling parameters) and `transform`s (applies scaling) to your data.  The `transform()` method will transform new data, using the same scaling parameters it learned for your previous data.\r\n\r\nIn the first example, you have separated the `fit` and `transform` methods into two separate lines, but the idea is similar -- you first learn the imputation parameters with the `fit` method, and then you transform your data. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I think `missingvalues = missingvalues.fit(X[:, 1:3])` could be changed to `missingvalues.fit(X[:, 1:3])`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\r\n  [2]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58444076#58444076","title":"What does fit() exactly does here?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12202313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02ba118bf855692cc680ba4f5d92c333?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ArmsMG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12202313/armsmg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571505410,"post_id":58447642,"comment_id":103266953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58447642#comment103266953_58447642"},{"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12202313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02ba118bf855692cc680ba4f5d92c333?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ArmsMG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12202313/armsmg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571747226,"post_id":58447642,"comment_id":103336954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58447642#comment103336954_58447642"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571389984,"creation_date":1571389984,"answer_id":58447642,"question_id":58443689,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58447642","body_markdown":"Here is also a nice check-up possibility: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html\r\n\r\nThe `fit`-method is always to learn something in machine learning.\r\n\r\nYou normally have the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.

Most tools have native intergration with Azure so you don&#39;t need to manually generate token, it will be done using keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n***Recommendation #2:***\r\nI don&#39;t think your challenge here relates to the tool you are using, but rather the expiration of your SAS Token. Are you intentionally expiring your token every 24 hours? If you extend the duration of that, then you won&#39;t have to create a new stage with a new SAS Token every day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to rotate SAS Tokens every day, then my suggestion would be to create a script (python or something) that actually requests the new Token from Azure and then creates then recreates your stage with the new token. Stored procedures or Tasks can not retrieve the SAS Token from Azure for you, so I&#39;m not sure how you would fully automate this process with SP or Tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n*Any other

Please excuse any mistakes in etiquette on my part.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to get the command &#39;C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe x&#39; to run on a directory.  Unfortunately, I&#39;ve learned that Python doesn&#39;t let you concatenate a string to a Path object, presumably because they are two different element types.  I have the following:\r\n\r\nIn config file:\r\n```\r\n[Paths]\r\nWinrarInstallPath = C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\\r\nNewFilesDirectory = M:\\Directory\\Where\\Rar Files\\Are\\Located\r\n```\r\nScript:\r\n```python\r\n**SOME CODE***\r\nnew_files_dir = Path(config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;NewFilesDirectory&#39;))\r\nwinrar_dir = Path(config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;WinrarInstallPath&#39;))\r\n\r\n**SOME MORE CODE**\r\nos.chdir(new_files_dir)\r\nfor currentdir, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(&#39;.&#39;):\r\n    os.system(winrar_dir + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nWhich gives me the error &quot;TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;WindowsPath&#39; and &#39;str&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried\r\n```python\r\nos.system(str(winrar_dir) + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t handle the spaces in the directory names.  I&#39;ve also tried\r\n```python\r\nos.system(os.path.join(winrar_dir, &quot;rar.exe x &quot;) + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nwith the same result\r\n\r\nI realize I can treat it as a string from the beginning and do the following\r\n```python\r\nwrd = config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;WinrarInstallationPath&#39;)\r\nwinrar_dir = &#39;&quot;&#39; + wrd + &#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n\r\nos.system(winrar_dir + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nbut Python has been pretty slick so far and this just feels very clumsy, so I feel like I&#39;m missing something, but I haven&#39;t been able to find an answer so far.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443677/how-do-i-build-an-os-system-command-using-a-path-object-string","title":"How do I build an os.system() command using a Path object + string?"},{"tags":["swift","class","viewcontroller","statusbar","presentviewcontroller"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":7941863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xupSZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Max Madill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7941863/max-madill"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571401614,"post_id":58443888,"comment_id":103239372,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443674/view-controller-when-segued-is-showing-status-bar/58443888#comment103239372_58443888"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12236251,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAwxvDC1X1K_S8AruD7a8ZLDBqgSos5Qkl1A8iBkQ=k-s128","display_name":"Santiago Jimenez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12236251/santiago-jimenez"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571372208,"creation_date":1571372208,"answer_id":58443888,"question_id":58443674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443888","body_markdown":"Select the segue and in the right pane under the attributes inspector change the &#39;Presentation&#39; to: &quot;Over current context&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe segue will then present to cover the entire screen.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.

The position of borders will change dynamically based on input but the label outside the border will be static. \r\n```typescript\r\npublic pieChartOptions: ChartOptions = {\r\n  responsive: true,\r\n  legend: {\r\n    display: false\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nchartlabels: Label[] = [];\r\nchartdata: SingleDataSet;\r\n\r\npublic chartType: ChartType = &#39;pie&#39;;\r\n// public pieChartLegend = {display:true,position:&#39;bottom&#39;};\r\n// public pieChartPlugins = [];\r\n\r\npublic chartcolors: Array&lt;any&gt; = [\r\n  {\r\n    backgroundColor: &quot;&quot;,\r\n    borderWidth: 1,\r\n  }\r\n];\r\n```\r\n \r\n```html\r\n&lt;canvas baseChart \r\n    [data]=&quot;chartdata&quot; \r\n    [labels]=&quot;chartlabels&quot; \r\n    [chartType]=&quot;chartType&quot;\r\n    [colors]=&quot;chartcolors&quot;\r\n    [options]=&quot;pieChartOptions&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;/canvas&gt;\r\n```\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0ntxz.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443655/how-to-display-labels-outside-the-pie-chart-border","title":"How to display labels outside the pie chart border?"},{"tags":["jsf","primefaces"],"owner":{"reputation":446,"user_id":1217879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40172ab71fc6b7c37eb7b2ad81afed97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rhbc73","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1217879/rhbc73"},"last_editor":{"reputation":446,"user_id":1217879,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":45,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/40172ab71fc6b7c37eb7b2ad81afed97?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"rhbc73","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1217879/rhbc73"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571390702,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571374787,"creation_date":1571370306,"last_edit_date":1571374787,"question_id":58443654,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443654","body_markdown":"I have a datatable in each row there&#39;s a link on click a new tab should be opened and a pdf will be opened (inline).

to @ecraig12345 for the tips.\r\n\r\nActually to achieve this, you have to use `Babel` plugin to transpile the JS generated from TS source again.\r\n\r\nThe steps:\r\n\r\n1, normally compile and output JS files from your TS project.\r\n\r\n2, use `npm` to install Babel and related plugins:\r\n   &gt; `@babel/cli`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/core`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/runtime`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-for-of`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\r\n\r\n3, edit your `.babelrc` file and use this content:\r\n`\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;plugins&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-for-of&quot;,\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator&quot;,\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-runtime&quot;\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n`\r\n\r\n4, edit your `tasks.json` of your TS project:\r\n`\r\n    {\r\n    ....\r\n        &quot;tasks&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;label&quot;: &quot;deployTs&quot;,\r\n                &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n                &quot;command&quot;: &quot;tsc TS_OUTPUT_JS_FOLDER/ --module commonjs --target es6&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;label&quot;: &quot;deployFinal&quot;,\r\n                &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n                &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx babel TS_OUTPUT_JS_FOLDER/ -d RE_TRANSPILE_OUTPUT_FOLDER/&quot;,\r\n                &quot;dependsOn&quot;: [&quot;depolyTs&quot;],\r\n                &quot;dependsOrder&quot;: &quot;sequence&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            ....\r\n        ]\r\n    ....\r\n    }\r\n`\r\n\r\n5, and then just execute `deployFinal` task by menu Terminal &gt; Run Tasks, and the task will first compile TS and then run Babel to transpile `async` syntax in the output folder step by step.\r\n\r\nHave fun.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443637/best-solution-for-transpiling-typescript-into-es6-without-transpiling-of-async/58497497#58497497","title":"Best solution for transpiling

the title perhaps makes you confused, let me explain of it:\r\n\r\nour JS environment is a little bit special, fully ES6 support without native generator `function*` and `yield`, so the Typescript

void 0, function* () { return yield Promise.resolve(); });\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nbut, wryly... our env does not support native generator..\r\nand, also we can&#39;t transpile TS into ES5, because there a few of libs referenced by the proj are ES6 modules, so if you transpile TS into ES5, the class can&#39;t be inherited (ES5 uses __extends to do this)\r\n\r\nso I&#39;m finding a solution to transpile our TS codes into ES6 but with all `async` in it transpiled into ES5 like style (`tslib.js`)\r\n\r\nI can accept whatever solutions, npm / node / post scripts / TS features whatever, what I

am using a script for inputting musical note selection (C, C#, etc) via checkboxes to find the name of the chord.

out.write(&#39;\\t&#39;.join(new_SE[i:i+10])+&#39;\\n&#39;)\r\n            i+=10\r\n        out.write(txt[idx[0][0]+bounds[1]:idx[1][0]])\r\n\r\nit&#39;s a little hacky atm, still trying to work it out, the important part is just:\r\n\r\n    while i &lt;= len(new_SE):\r\n        out.write(&#39;\\t&#39;.join(new_SE[i:i+10])+&#39;\\n&#39;)\r\n        i+=10\r\n\r\nnew_SE is just a list of

&#39;19.128999999999998&#39; ...]\r\n\r\nI also tried playing around with justified side with something like:\r\n\r\n    &#39;%8s  %8s&#39; % (tmp[0], tmp[1])\r\n\r\nto basically have 8 spaces between the text but right justify them\r\n\r\nhonestly struggling...if anyone can recreate the original text in between #Sta/Elev= 452 and #Mann I would be eternally grateful, here is the full list if someone wants to give it a go:\r\n\r\n    new_SE = [&#39;0&#39;, &#39;30.097&#39;, &#39;67.042&#39;, &#39;19.137&#39;, &#39;67.43&#39;, &#39;19.139&#39;, &#39;68.208&#39;, &#39;19.073&#39;,

And `-&gt;&gt; &#39;Item&#39;` then returns the key `&quot;Item&quot;` from within that JSON as a `text` (aka varchar) value.\r\n\r\nThis requires that `colb` is defined as `jsonb` (or at least `json`). If not, you need to cast it like this `colb::jsonb`. &lt;br&gt;\r\nBut in the long run you should really convert that column to `jsonb` then.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to search for `Item = &#39;abc&#39;` *anywhere* in the `Items` array (not just position 0), you can use the `@&gt;` operator: \r\n\r\n    select *\r\n    from data\r\n    where colb @&gt; &#39;{&quot;Items&quot;: [{&quot;Item&quot;: &quot;abc&quot;}]}&#39;;\r\n\r\nOnline example: https://rextester.com/BQWB24156\r\n\r\nThe above can use a GIN index on the column `colb`. The first query will require an index on _that_ expression. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith Postgres 12 you can use a JSON path query like you have:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM table1 \r\n    where jsonb_path_exists(colb, &#39;$.Items[0].Item&#39; ?

a bit hard to tell exactly what you&#39;re asking.  If you have an ordered set of locations where configuration values can be stored and you want them to be accessed in a particular way such as: \r\n\r\n    read the value from the database\r\n    if value not stored in the database, \r\n        then check for value in the config file\r\n\r\nThen, you would likely need to do one of these things:\r\n\r\n1. Expose an API for reading the value and your own logic checks for the value in the right order and force you clients to use the API, not read database or config file directly.\r\n\r\n2. Force the clients to all check for things in the proper order.\r\n\r\n3. Keep the config file up to date with the latest value so an outside developer can always just read the config file to get the latest value.  This means that any time a relevant value in the database is updated, you have to update the database.\r\n\r\n4. Read the config file values on startup into the database so you only have one storage place for the &quot;live&quot; values (the database).  Then force all clients to only read config values from the database.\r\n\r\n5. Get rid of the config file entirely and just store things in the database.  If you need to change the config, modify the values in the database.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443583/is-there-anyway-to-read-a-value-in-a-file-and-sync-with-the-presence-value-in-da/58444127#58444127","title":"Is there anyway to read a value in a file and sync with the presence value in database?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":7627592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10208613302517406/picture?type=large","display_name":"Naju Mat Isa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7627592/naju-mat-isa"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58444127,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571374297,"creation_date":1571369649,"question_id":58443583,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443583","body_markdown":"hi i have a table that store all configuration setting, at the same time, i also have one hardcoded config file. but, i have problem when user, which is non developer want to access some config value, and the config value is not presence in database but present in hardcoded file, how can i achieve this objective?\r\n\r\nhow can i make sure that my configuration table overrides value that were already present in hardcoded file? so that user can access all values in the config file as well as those in database?\r\n\r\nI&#39;m using nodeJS, es6, objections JS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443583/is-there-anyway-to-read-a-value-in-a-file-and-sync-with-the-presence-value-in-da","title":"Is there anyway to read a value in a file and sync with the presence value in database?"},{"tags":["sql","sql-server","tsql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5062,"user_id":1127428,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":79,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/af578d7fa8f5faee252c9d38b89ad5d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dale Burrell","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1127428/dale-burrell"},"edited":false,"score":4,"creation_date":1571370452,"post_id":58443579,"comment_id":103226238,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443579/can-anyone-explain-this-sql-query-clearly#comment103226238_58443579"},{"owner":{"reputation":2253,"user_id":8898324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0f76695dba2a7806ef75c62822c9200?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TomC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8898324/tomc"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571371731,"post_id":58443579,"comment_id":103226497,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443579/can-anyone-explain-this-sql-query-clearly#comment103226497_58443579"},{"owner":{"reputation":55448,"user_id":5089204,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xGm6I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shnugo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5089204/shnugo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571385292,"post_id":58443579,"comment_id":103230979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443579/can-anyone-explain-this-sql-query-clearly#comment103230979_58443579"},{"owner":{"reputation":1633,"user_id":3064345,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/fsh6H.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zorkolot","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3064345/zorkolot"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571411383,"post_id":58443579,"comment_id":103244744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443579/can-anyone-explain-this-sql-query-clearly#comment103244744_58443579"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2253,"user_id":8898324,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0f76695dba2a7806ef75c62822c9200?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TomC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8898324/tomc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571371899,"creation_date":1571371899,"answer_id":58443846,"question_id":58443579,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443846","body_markdown":"Line by line:\r\n\r\nFirst get the raw number of days between the dates:\r\n\r\n    (DATEDIFF(dd, Startdate,Enddate))\r\n\r\nSubtract the number of weekend days, which will be the number of weeks times 2\r\n\r\n    -(DATEDIFF(wk, Startdate,Enddate )*2)\r\n\r\nAdjust for the case where the start date is a Sunday\r\n\r\n    -(CASE WHEN DATENAME(dw, Startdate) = &#39;Sunday&#39;

Boolean logic is flawed.\r\n\r\nThe opposite of (A and B and C) is (!A or !B or !C) -- if you negate the conditions, you need to switch operators.\r\n\r\nYour syntax is flawed. &quot;ELSE&quot; does need or allow a condition; its just the word &quot;ELSE&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;ELSE IF&quot; is a whole different animal; that keyword in Python is ELIF and your condition should be something other than the diametric opposite of the condition in the IF.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n````\r\nif a&gt;b and A&gt;B and R&lt;w&lt;a&lt;Q:\r\n   ... code will run when all conditions are true\r\nelif a&lt;b:\r\n   ... code will run when first initial condition failed\r\nelse:\r\n   ... code will run when A&lt;B or !(R&lt;w&lt;a&lt;Q)\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n2) The condition **R&amp;lt;w&amp;lt;a&amp;lt;Q** is invalid in most computer languages and would need to be a series of ANDed single inequality conditions, ie (R&amp;lt;w &amp;&amp; w&amp;lt;a &amp;&amp; a&amp;lt;Q)\r\n\r\n\r\nOr you could always nest\r\n\r\n````\r\nif a&gt;b :\r\n   if A&gt;B :\r\n      if R&lt;w and w&lt;a and a&lt;Q :\r\n         # your &quot;everything&#39;s true&quot; code\r\n

thing is when the connection fails, `channel` is `null` so you can&#39;t do `channel.stream` and the `StreamBuilder` can&#39;t have a `Stream`. So, one approach you could take is to have a `Stream` in the `WebSocket` that handles the retries and when the `channel` is ready, pass the data that comes from `channel.stream` to the `WebSocket` `Stream`.\r\n\r\nThis is how could be the `WebSocket`:\r\n\r\n    class WebSocket {\r\n      static WebSocket _instance;\r\n      final _streamController = StreamController.broadcast();\r\n      IOWebSocketChannel channel;\r\n    \r\n      static WebSocket get instance {\r\n        if (_instance == null) {\r\n          _instance = WebSocket();\r\n        }\r\n        return _instance;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Stream get channelStream =&gt; _streamController.stream;\r\n    \r\n      Future init(int retries) async {\r\n        if (channel == null) {\r\n          await _tryToConnect(retries);\r\n          if (channel != null) {\r\n            _streamController.sink.add(null);\r\n            channel.stream.listen((value) {\r\n              _streamController.sink.add(value);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            _streamController.sink.addError(&quot;Could not connect&quot;);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Future _tryToConnect(int retries) async {\r\n        if (channel == null) {\r\n          try {\r\n            String macAddress = await getMacAddress();\r\n            // This is to throw exception if it can&#39;t connect (https://github.com/dart-lang/web_socket_channel/issues/38#issuecomment-450383558)\r\n            final socket = await WebSocket.connect(\r\n                    &quot;ws://172.16.0.39:8001/ws/fsmart-door/$macAddress&quot;)\r\n                .timeout(_webSocketConnectionTimeout);\r\n            channel = IOWebSocketChannel(socket);\r\n          } catch (e) {\r\n            debugPrint(e.toString());\r\n          }\r\n          if (channel == null &amp;&amp; retries &gt; 0) {\r\n            _streamController.sink.addError(&quot;Retries left: ${retries - 1}&quot;);\r\n            await _tryToConnect(retries - 1);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void close() =&gt; _streamController.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd this would be the `StreamBuilder`:\r\n\r\n    StreamBuilder(\r\n      stream: WebSocket.instance.channelStream,\r\n      builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n        if (snapshot.hasData) {\r\n          return Text(&#39;Data: ${snapshot.data}&#39;);\r\n        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n          return Text(&#39;Error: ${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n        return Text(&#39;Loading...&#39;);\r\n      },\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a quick test of this solution, replace the two lines in the `try` `catch`, for this:\r\n\r\n    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n    if (retries == 2) channel = IOWebSocketChannel();\r\n\r\nUse this `IOWebSocketChannel`\r\n\r\n    class IOWebSocketChannel {\r\n      var _streamController = StreamController&lt;String&gt;.broadcast();\r\n    \r\n      IOWebSocketChannel() {\r\n        init();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Stream get stream =&gt; _streamController.stream;\r\n    \r\n      Future init() async {\r\n        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n        _streamController.sink.add(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n        _streamController.sink.add(&quot;2&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void close() =&gt; _streamController.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd use this example in a `StatefulWidget`:\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    void initState() {\r\n      super.initState();\r\n      WebSocket.instance.init(5);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @override\r\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n      return Scaffold(\r\n        body: Center(\r\n          child: StreamBuilder(\r\n            stream: WebSocket.instance.channelStream,\r\n            builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n              if (snapshot.hasData) {\r\n                return Text(&#39;Data: ${snapshot.data}&#39;);\r\n              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n                return Text(&#39;Error: ${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n              }\r\n              return Text(&#39;Loading...&#39;);\r\n            },\r\n          ),\r\n        ),\r\n      );\r\n

It&#39;s very difficult to understand the **precise** meaning of stuff you read on the internet, so I&#39;m hoping someone can read my theory of what&#39;s happening and point out any mistakes.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n--\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a PCIe card with some memory on it. For the sake of discussion, assume the following concrete setup:\r\n\r\n- It has 4 MB to be accessed via base address register 0 (whatever that means)\r\n- It is the only PCIe card in the whole system\r\n- It is plugged into a PCIe slot, which connects to the root complex via copper wires in the motherboard\r\n- There is a root complex connected directly to the CPU&#39;s bus (is this the normal way things are connected?)\r\n- The PCIe card is somehow configured to be device number 0 (how is this done?)\r\n- We&#39;re using Linux.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s also settle on terminology:\r\n\r\n- The *system bus* is the CPU&#39;s own bus. \r\n- The *PCIe bus* refers the literal wires on the motherboard between the CPU and PCIe slot\r\n- A *driver* is a Linux kernel module\r\n- A *device* is a literal physical object\r\n- A *device struct* is the `pci_dev` structure filled by the kernel\r\n- A *BAR (base address register)* is the field inside a PCIe device&#39;s configuration space\r\n- A *BAR space* is the address space which is indicated (?) by the value in a BAR.\r\n\r\nMy theory of what&#39;s going on\r\n--\r\n\r\n1. At boot time, Linux starts probing different addresses to see if there&#39;s anything there.\r\n\r\n    - Since the PCIe bus wires are only connected to the system bus wires via a bridge (i.e. the PCIe controller on the system bus) Linux must know how to interact with the PCIe controller.\r\n    - Linux sends special commands to the PCIe controller (through memory-mapped IO?) that end up triggering the correct series of voltages on the PCIe wires\r\n    - If it gets a response, it will fill in a `pci_dev` struct with other information in the configuration space\r\n    - At some point in the future (when?) the kernel will iterate through the list of PCI drivers to try and match them to devices\r\n2. When Linux detects a device, it will map its BAR space into the system bus. (How is this done?) Suppose it maps the BAR0 space to address `0x55500000` to `0x5550FFFF` on the system bus.\r\n    - Linux must have to tell the root complex to listen to these addresses, and that they correspond to the PCIe card it detected.\r\n    - By the way, Linux will set base address register 0 on our PCIe card to have `0x55500000` in its base address field (why bother?)\r\n3. Subsequent writes on the system bus between `0x55500000` and `0x5550FFFF` are &quot;caught&quot; by the root complex, and issued out to the PCIe card\r\n    - The root complex will essentially build a packet will all the headers and checksums and the like and blast them out over the motherboard&#39;s copper wires to the PCIe slot\r\n4. Supposing the CPU wrote `0xDEADBEEF` to address `0x55501230` on the system bus, and that the root complex sent out the packet to the PCIe card, the card receives the packet and writes `0xDEADBEEF` to `0x01230` in its local 4 MB memory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo: what parts of this are right and which are wrong?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443506/precise-details-of-writing-a-byte-into-pcie-address-space-from-cpu","title":"Precise details of writing a byte into PCIe address

Move the validation to your modules**\r\n\r\nYou can consider move that logical process to your code. \r\n\r\nI can think of the following: \r\n\r\n- Instead of serving the files from the JSON file, you can send all the request to a single endpoint or function.\r\n\r\n - That function would map all the incoming requests and would send it to the proper module of your app.\r\n\r\n- For instance, if the request you receive matches with &quot;public/fodler1/*&quot;, you can validate that the actual file they&#39;re trying to call exists.\r\n\r\n  - If it exists, you return it.\r\n\r\n  - If not, you send an error.\r\n\r\n**2. Customize your 404 response**\r\n\r\nYou can serve a [custom your 404 Not Found error][1] when a user tries to access a page that doesn&#39;t exist.\r\n\r\nCreate a new file in your project&#39;s public directory, name it 404.html, then add your custom 404 Not Found content to the file.\r\n\r\nFirebase Hosting will display the content of this custom 404.html page if a browser triggers a 404 Not Found error on your domain or subdomain.\r\n\r\n**3. Use Regex to validate your files**\r\n\r\nUse a Regex in your JSON to validate that the object(s) exist(s).\r\n\r\nI think this is the least idea you should consider. This is because you should update your JSON every time a file gets uploaded, deleted, or renamed.\r\n\r\nYou can also normalize your files so all could match with a Regex to use in your JSON. However, this last idea might not be the best because we&#39;d return to your original issue: If a hacker gets that Regex, the effort would be in vane.\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/full-config#404","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443495/direct-all-requests-to-a-function-including-those-with-parameters/58532022#58532022","title":"Direct all requests to a function including those with parameters"}],"owner":{"reputation":40,"user_id":12167708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc0074ed142312f7266be441180479a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hkrlys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167708/hkrlys"},"last_editor":{"reputation":40,"user_id":12167708,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dc0074ed142312f7266be441180479a5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"hkrlys","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12167708/hkrlys"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571871817,"creation_date":1571368894,"last_edit_date":1571385145,"question_id":58443495,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443495","body_markdown":"I am trying to redirect ALL of the requests to `http function.`\r\n\r\nI could see that our function will be called for every `example.com/someID` request, but will **not** for `example.com/folder1/someID`.

I am using frames per second and multiplying that by the video duration to figure out how many frames I need to have in total, and I&#39;m dividing the total duration by the sample counts to make sure cgImages are generated evenly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    let videoDuration = asset.duration\r\n    print(&quot;video duration: \\(videoDuration.seconds)&quot;)\r\n    let videoTrack = asset.tracks(withMediaType: AVMediaType.video)[0]\r\n    let fps = videoTrack.nominalFrameRate\r\n    var frameForTimes = [NSValue]()\r\n    let sampleCounts = Int(videoDuration.seconds * Double(fps))\r\n    let totalTimeLength = Int(videoDuration.seconds * Double(videoDuration.timescale))\r\n    let step = totalTimeLength / sampleCounts\r\n    for i in 0 ..&lt; sampleCounts {\r\n         let cmTime = CMTimeMake(value: Int64(i * step), timescale: Int32(videoDuration.timescale))\r\n         frameForTimes.append(NSValue(time: cmTime))\r\n    }\r\n\r\nand the way in which I create images ([see this](https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/66332/)): \r\n\r\n```\r\nimageGenerator.generateCGImagesAsynchronously(forTimes: timeValues) { (requestedTime, cgImage, actualTime, result, error) in\r\n     if let cgImage = cgImage {\r\n          print(&quot;Requested: \\(requestedTime.seconds), Actual: \\(actualTime.seconds)&quot;)\r\n          let image = UIImage(cgImage: cgImage)\r\n          // scale image if you want\r\n          frames.append(image)\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also set tolerance to zero before calling `generateCGImages`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimageGenerator.requestedTimeToleranceBefore = CMTime.zero\r\nimageGenerator.requestedTimeToleranceAfter = CMTime.zero\r\n```\r\n\r\nI expected the actual times to be consistent with the requested times, and for each image produced to be different. Looking through the images, there is always a duplicate regardless of the video being tested, and it normally occurs towards the middle to end.\r\n\r\n**Edit:**\r\n\r\nI found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15245781/avassetimagegenerator-returns-sometimes-same-image-from-2-successive-frames),

sanity check documentation explains this:\r\n\r\n&gt; dev-deps: Checks that all packages except -dev or -staticdev packages\r\n&gt; do not depend on -dev packages, which would be a packaging bug.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s telling you that in your current recipe &quot;XXX&quot; runtime-depends on &quot;AAA-dev&quot; and that this is a normally an error. You need to find out how/why this dependency is added before you can decide what the correct solution is.\r\n\r\nBased on the added recipes: The issue seems to be that onenet build produces an unversioned &quot;.so&quot; file. This is typically a mistake (the actual library file should be e.g. &quot;libmqtt.so.1.1&quot; and the unversioned file should just be a symlink to the versioned one). I&#39;m very surprised that you are not getting a fatal error on this issue when you build onenet. Are you suppressing the QA error for this?  \r\n\r\nSince you&#39;ve managed to build onenet somehow, you now probably have a onenet-dev package that erroneously contains the actual library: The build system notices this during atfwd-daemon build, adds a runtime dependency to onenet-dev (because that&#39;s where the library is) and then the QA error triggers because normal packages should not depend on -dev packages.\r\n\r\nPossible fixes:\r\n\r\n* Either fix the onenet build system so it produces a versioned library, or\r\n* Force the .so file to be packaged into the actual onenet package instead of onenet-dev, like this:\r\n\r\n        FILES_${PN}-dev = &quot;${includedir}/&quot;\r\n        FILES_${PN} += &quot;${libdir}/libmqtt.so&quot;\r\n\r\nA bonus suggestion: Using directory variables instead of paths like  /usr/include and /usr/lib (like I did above) is a good &quot;Best Practice&quot;.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443713/bitbake-depends-aaa-packet-it-will-rdepends-aaa-dev/58445069#58445069","title":"Bitbake depends AAA packet, it will rdepends AAA-dev"}],"owner":{"reputation":443,"user_id":2151287,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aea53781b823a637e50add15cb9aa111?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sundq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2151287/sundq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":443,"user_id":2151287,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aea53781b823a637e50add15cb9aa111?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"sundq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2151287/sundq"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58445069,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571392202,"creation_date":1571370759,"last_edit_date":1571389607,"question_id":58443713,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443713","body_markdown":"   I add depends packet to a exist `.bb` file, such as add `DPENDS=&quot;AAA&quot;` line to `.bb` file, when I compile the `.bb` file, it failed for `XXX rdepends on AAA-dev [dev-deps]`, and I search google, all the answer almost is add line `INSANE_SKIP_${PN} += &quot;dev-deps&quot;` or `RDEPENDS_${PN}_remove = &quot;AAA-dev&quot;` to `.bb` file.\r\n\r\n   But my question is why? why one packet depend AAA packet, it should also `RDPENDS` AAA-dev, is there any other answer to fix this problem  \r\n\r\nThe `bb` source file is:\r\n```\r\ninherit autotools qcommon\r\nDESCRIPTION = &quot;Daemon to handle AT commands&quot;\r\nDEPENDS = &quot;glib-2.0 qmi qmi-framework qmi-client-helper ocean-link&quot;\r\n\r\nSRC_DIR = &quot;${WORKSPACE}/atfwd-daemon/&quot;\r\nS = &quot;${WORKDIR}/atfwd-daemon/&quot;\r\n\r\nPR = &quot;r3&quot;\r\nEXTRA_OECONF += &quot;--with-glib --with-common-includes=${STAGING_INCDIR}&quot;\r\n\r\ndo_configure_append() {\r\n    echo &quot;/*This is compiled to generate, only look don&#39;t try*/&quot;

See the [Python documentation][1] for more info about Classes in Python. For more info about `sklearn` in particular, take a look at this [sklearn documentation][2].\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a short description of how you are using Classes in `sklearn`.\r\n\r\nFirst you instantiate your `sklearn` Classes with `sc_X = StandardScaler()` or `missingvalues = SimpleImputer(...)`.\r\n\r\nThe objects, `sc_X` and `missingvalues`, each have methods. You can use the methods typing `object_name.method_name(...)`.  For example, you used the `fit_transform()` method of the `sc_X` instance when you typed, `sc_X.fit_transform(...)`. This method will take your data and return a scaled version of it. It both `fit`s (determines the scaling parameters) and `transform`s (applies scaling) to your data.  The `transform()` method will transform new data, using the same scaling parameters it learned for your previous data.\r\n\r\nIn the first example, you have separated the `fit` and `transform` methods into two separate lines, but the idea is similar -- you first learn the imputation parameters with the `fit` method, and then you transform your data. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I think `missingvalues = missingvalues.fit(X[:, 1:3])` could be changed to `missingvalues.fit(X[:, 1:3])`.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html\r\n  [2]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58444076#58444076","title":"What does fit() exactly does here?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12202313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02ba118bf855692cc680ba4f5d92c333?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ArmsMG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12202313/armsmg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571505410,"post_id":58447642,"comment_id":103266953,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58447642#comment103266953_58447642"},{"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5,"user_id":12202313,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/02ba118bf855692cc680ba4f5d92c333?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ArmsMG","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12202313/armsmg"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571747226,"post_id":58447642,"comment_id":103336954,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443689/what-does-fit-exactly-does-here/58447642#comment103336954_58447642"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1520,"user_id":10232932,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ec8ac182af86808de7f193677348c87d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"PV8","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10232932/pv8"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571389984,"creation_date":1571389984,"answer_id":58447642,"question_id":58443689,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58447642","body_markdown":"Here is also a nice check-up possibility: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html\r\n\r\nThe `fit`-method is always to learn something in machine learning.\r\n\r\nYou normally have the following steps:\r\n\r\n 1.

Most tools have native intergration with Azure so you don&#39;t need to manually generate token, it will be done using keys.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n***Recommendation #2:***\r\nI don&#39;t think your challenge here relates to the tool you are using, but rather the expiration of your SAS Token. Are you intentionally expiring your token every 24 hours? If you extend the duration of that, then you won&#39;t have to create a new stage with a new SAS Token every day.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to rotate SAS Tokens every day, then my suggestion would be to create a script (python or something) that actually requests the new Token from Azure and then creates then recreates your stage with the new token. Stored procedures or Tasks can not retrieve the SAS Token from Azure for you, so I&#39;m not sure how you would fully automate this process with SP or Tasks.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n*Any other

It&#39;s basically a digest script that unrars all files in a directory.  Please keep in mind, I am teaching myself Python, this is my first python script and this is my first post.  Please excuse any mistakes in etiquette on my part.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to get the command &#39;C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\Rar.exe x&#39; to run on a directory.  Unfortunately, I&#39;ve learned that Python doesn&#39;t let you concatenate a string to a Path object, presumably because they are two different element types.  I have the following:\r\n\r\nIn config file:\r\n```\r\n[Paths]\r\nWinrarInstallPath = C:\\Program Files\\WinRAR\\\r\nNewFilesDirectory = M:\\Directory\\Where\\Rar Files\\Are\\Located\r\n```\r\nScript:\r\n```python\r\n**SOME CODE***\r\nnew_files_dir = Path(config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;NewFilesDirectory&#39;))\r\nwinrar_dir = Path(config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;WinrarInstallPath&#39;))\r\n\r\n**SOME MORE CODE**\r\nos.chdir(new_files_dir)\r\nfor currentdir, dirnames, filenames in os.walk(&#39;.&#39;):\r\n    os.system(winrar_dir + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nWhich gives me the error &quot;TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;WindowsPath&#39; and &#39;str&#39;&quot;\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried\r\n```python\r\nos.system(str(winrar_dir) + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nbut it doesn&#39;t handle the spaces in the directory names.  I&#39;ve also tried\r\n```python\r\nos.system(os.path.join(winrar_dir, &quot;rar.exe x &quot;) + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nwith the same result\r\n\r\nI realize I can treat it as a string from the beginning and do the following\r\n```python\r\nwrd = config.get(&#39;Paths&#39;, &#39;WinrarInstallationPath&#39;)\r\nwinrar_dir = &#39;&quot;&#39; + wrd + &#39;&quot;&#39;\r\n\r\nos.system(winrar_dir + &quot;rar.exe x &quot; + os.getcwd() + currentdir[1:] + &#39;\\\\*.rar&#39;)\r\n```\r\nbut Python has been pretty slick so far and this just feels very clumsy, so I feel like I&#39;m missing something, but I haven&#39;t been able to find an answer so far.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443677/how-do-i-build-an-os-system-command-using-a-path-object-string","title":"How do I build an os.system() command using a Path object + string?"},{"tags":["swift","class","viewcontroller","statusbar","presentviewcontroller"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":7941863,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/xupSZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Max Madill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7941863/max-madill"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571401614,"post_id":58443888,"comment_id":103239372,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443674/view-controller-when-segued-is-showing-status-bar/58443888#comment103239372_58443888"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12236251,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAwxvDC1X1K_S8AruD7a8ZLDBqgSos5Qkl1A8iBkQ=k-s128","display_name":"Santiago Jimenez","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12236251/santiago-jimenez"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571372208,"creation_date":1571372208,"answer_id":58443888,"question_id":58443674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443888","body_markdown":"Select the segue and in the right pane under the attributes inspector change the &#39;Presentation&#39; to: &quot;Over current context&quot;.\r\n\r\nThe segue will then present to cover the entire screen.\r\n\r\nHope it helps.

I have also tried a `.then` after the call, but being a recursive method, it still keeps going over the `.then` and keeps running the recursive method. \r\n\r\n        string = &quot;&lt;div&gt;I am a div node&lt;/div&gt;&quot;\r\n\r\n        var frag = document.createRange().createContextualFragment(string)\r\n\r\n\r\n        function walkTheDOMFirst(node, func) {\r\n          func(node);\r\n          node = node.firstChild;\r\n          while (node) {\r\n              walkTheDOMFirst(node, func);\r\n              node = node.nextSibling;\r\n          }\r\n\r\n        }\r\n        walkTheDOMFirst(frag, async function(node){\r\n          console.log(node)\r\n          await asyncCall(1)\r\n \r\n        })\r\n\r\n       function asyncCall(x){\r\n          return new Promise(function(res){\r\n              setTimeout(function(){\r\n              res(console.log(x+1))\r\n              },3000)\r\n          })\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe actual results are:\r\n\r\n        node\r\n        node\r\n        node\r\n        asyncCall value\r\n\r\nWhat I actually want is:\r\n\r\n        node\r\n        asyncCall value\r\n        node\r\n        asyncCall value\r\n        node\r\n        asyncCall value","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443649/why-is-my-asynchronous-call-not-running-at-the-time-i-want","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"Why is my asynchronous call not running at the time I want?"},{"tags":["javascript","html","angular","typescript","html-table"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11377496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oXBFe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Souradip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377496/souradip"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571374556,"post_id":58443648,"comment_id":103227065,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443648/is-there-any-way-to-get-values-corresponding-to-a-column-in-a-table-upon-selecti#comment103227065_58443648"}],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11377496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oXBFe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Souradip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377496/souradip"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11377496,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oXBFe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Souradip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11377496/souradip"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571374452,"creation_date":1571370268,"last_edit_date":1571374452,"question_id":58443648,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443648","body_markdown":"I have a table using json data from an API.

to @ecraig12345 for the tips.\r\n\r\nActually to achieve this, you have to use `Babel` plugin to transpile the JS generated from TS source again.\r\n\r\nThe steps:\r\n\r\n1, normally compile and output JS files from your TS project.\r\n\r\n2, use `npm` to install Babel and related plugins:\r\n   &gt; `@babel/cli`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/core`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/runtime`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-for-of`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator`\r\n\r\n   &gt; `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\r\n\r\n3, edit your `.babelrc` file and use this content:\r\n`\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;plugins&quot;: [\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-for-of&quot;,\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator&quot;,\r\n            &quot;@babel/plugin-transform-runtime&quot;\r\n        ]\r\n    }\r\n`\r\n\r\n4, edit your `tasks.json` of your TS project:\r\n`\r\n    {\r\n    ....\r\n        &quot;tasks&quot;: [\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;label&quot;: &quot;deployTs&quot;,\r\n                &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n                &quot;command&quot;: &quot;tsc TS_OUTPUT_JS_FOLDER/ --module commonjs --target es6&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n                &quot;label&quot;: &quot;deployFinal&quot;,\r\n                &quot;group&quot;: &quot;build&quot;,\r\n                &quot;type&quot;: &quot;shell&quot;,\r\n                &quot;command&quot;: &quot;npx babel TS_OUTPUT_JS_FOLDER/ -d RE_TRANSPILE_OUTPUT_FOLDER/&quot;,\r\n                &quot;dependsOn&quot;: [&quot;depolyTs&quot;],\r\n                &quot;dependsOrder&quot;: &quot;sequence&quot;\r\n            },\r\n            ....\r\n        ]\r\n    ....\r\n    }\r\n`\r\n\r\n5, and then just execute `deployFinal` task by menu Terminal &gt; Run Tasks, and the task will first compile TS and then run Babel to transpile `async` syntax in the output folder step by step.\r\n\r\nHave fun.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443637/best-solution-for-transpiling-typescript-into-es6-without-transpiling-of-async/58497497#58497497","title":"Best solution for transpiling

the title perhaps makes you confused, let me explain of it:\r\n\r\nour JS environment is a little bit special, fully ES6 support without native generator `function*` and `yield`, so the Typescript

a few of libs referenced by the proj are ES6 modules, so if you transpile TS into ES5, the class can&#39;t be inherited (ES5 uses __extends to do this)\r\n\r\nso I&#39;m finding a solution to

am using a script for inputting musical note selection (C, C#, etc) via checkboxes to find the name of the chord. With one octave it works perfectly.\r\n\r\nI have 12 checkboxes with the following string as an example:\r\n\r\n```\t\r\nif (\r\n    cb[0].checked == true\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[1].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[2].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[3].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[4].checked == true\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[5].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[6].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[7].checked == true\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[8].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[9].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[10].checked == false\r\n    &amp;&amp; cb[11].checked == false\r\n) {\r\n    alert(&#39;C&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis works fine when boxes C0, C4 and C7 are checked, and of course not when any other combination is checked.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to add an extra octave. I&#39;ve added a 13th box (C12) as an optional alternative to C0.\r\n\r\nI tried adding the `||` operator as follows:\r\n```\r\nif(cb[0].checked==true||cb[12]==true&amp;&amp;cb[1].checked==false...\r\n```\r\nbut this doesn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nStrangely, just adding box C12 to the page without changing the script string at all, when I select boxes C12, C4 and C7 I get the result alert &#39;G♯/A♭m&#39;, which I should get only for this string:\r\n\r\n```\r\nelse if (\r\n\tcb[8].checked == true\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[9].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[10].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[11].checked == true\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[0].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[1].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[2].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[3].checked == true\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[4].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[5].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[6].checked == false\r\n\t&amp;&amp; cb[7].checked == false\r\n) {\r\n\talert(&#39;G♯/A♭m&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\t\r\n\r\nwhich I don&#39;t understand, as that string contains no cb[12] and only 2 of the 3 `true` checkboxes required.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there a correct way I can add this `||cb[12]==true` thread so that either C0 or C12 get the same result?\r\n\r\nThanks for reading this long question! Any advice appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443636/correct-addition-of-or-logical-operator","title":"Correct addition of OR logical operator"},{"tags":["python","file","csv"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":768036,"user_id":100297,"user_type":"moderator","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24780fb6df85a943c7aea0402c843737?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Martijn Pieters","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/100297/martijn-pieters"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571408438,"post_id":58443632,"comment_id":103243171,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443632/how-do-i-use-pathlib-csv-module-to-write#comment103243171_58443632"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2651,"user_id":301513,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":47,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0461c42f412ae4d88bd5722cde72c84e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Qiulang","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/301513/qiulang"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571372695,"post_id":58443670,"comment_id":103226696,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443632/how-do-i-use-pathlib-csv-module-to-write/58443670#comment103226696_58443670"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"last_editor":{"reputation":53931,"user_id":6890912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d291e4dfbf14dcc8874bd4fa620fac23?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"blhsing","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6890912/blhsing"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571370997,"last_edit_date":1571370997,"creation_date":1571370438,"answer_id":58443670,"question_id":58443632,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443670","body_markdown":"`csvFileObj` is a `Path` object.

This is the code - \r\n\r\n    server {\r\n\r\n       listen 80;\r\n       server_name 10.xxx.x.x;\r\n       location = /favicon.ico {access_log off;log_not_found off;} \r\n       \r\n       location = /static/ {\r\n         root /home/jainpriyanshu1991/learnEarn/le-webiste;    \r\n       }\r\n       \r\n       \r\n       location = / {\r\n         include proxy_params;\r\n         proxy_pass http://unix:/home/jainpriyanshu1991/learnEarn/le-webiste/le_website.sock;\r\n       }\r\n     }\r\n\r\nWhen I try the url `myIPaddress/static/` , it works and shows the folders inside it. But it does not work for any subfolder within static. It gives `/usr/share/nginx/html/static/img/index.html` is not found for img folder inside static. Similarly, when I try the url `myIPaddress/` it opens the homepage of website but again, it does not work for any other link and gives error. For about page it gives error `/usr/share/nginx/html/about` failed (2: No such file or directory).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443612/nginx-can-access-static-folder-but-not-other-folders-inside-it-throws-sub-folde","title":"Nginx can access static folder but not other folders inside it.

the text but right justify them\r\n\r\nhonestly struggling...if anyone can recreate the original text in between #Sta/Elev= 452 and #Mann I would be eternally grateful, here is the full list if

I have a sidebar menu and top menu that I want to be fixed:position so they remain static on the screen however if I do that the content div shifts underneath the menus. I realize i can add margin to shift them back into place but even then if I do the toggle button to expand the sliding menu then what is the best method to shift that sideways? I have put everything in this jsfiddle:\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/4x60gqsn/\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nShaun\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;html&gt;\r\n    &lt;head&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;X-UA-Compatible&quot; content=&quot;IE=edge&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;title&gt;Collapsible sidebar using Bootstrap 4&lt;/title&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- Bootstrap CSS CDN --&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.0/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-9gVQ4dYFwwWSjIDZnLEWnxCjeSWFphJiwGPXr1jddIhOegiu1FwO5qRGvFXOdJZ4&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;!-- Our Custom CSS --&gt;\r\n        &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;!-- Font Awesome JS --&gt;\r\n        &lt;script defer src=&quot;https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/js/solid.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-tzzSw1/Vo+0N5UhStP3bvwWPq+uvzCMfrN1fEFe+xBmv1C/AtVX5K0uZtmcHitFZ&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n        &lt;script defer src=&quot;https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/js/fontawesome.js&quot; integrity=&quot;sha384-6OIrr52G08NpOFSZdxxz1xdNSndlD4vdcf/q2myIUVO0VsqaGHJsB0RaBE01VTOY&quot; crossorigin=&quot;anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;/head&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;body&gt;\r\n    \r\n        &lt;div class=&quot;wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;!-- Sidebar  --&gt;\r\n            &lt;nav id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;sidebar-header&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;img class=&quot;nav-logo&quot; src=&quot;../login/images/PrintPerry.png&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;strong&gt;PP&lt;/strong&gt;\r\n                &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n                &lt;ul class=&quot;list-unstyled components&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-home&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                            &lt;span class=&quot;nav-text&quot;&gt;\r\n                                HOME\r\n                            &lt;/span&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;li&gt;\r\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-home&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                            &lt;span class=&quot;nav-text&quot;&gt;\r\n                                TEST\r\n                            &lt;/span&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/li&gt;\r\n                &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n            &lt;/nav&gt;\r\n            \r\n            &lt;!-- Page Content  --&gt;\r\n            &lt;div id=&quot;content&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n                &lt;nav class=&quot;navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div class=&quot;container-fluid&quot;&gt;\r\n    \r\n                        &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; id=&quot;sidebarCollapse&quot;&gt;\r\n                            &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-align-justify fa-lg&quot; &gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                        &lt;span&gt;\r\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;profile-btn&quot;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-user fa-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                            &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; class=&quot;profile-btn&quot;&gt;\r\n                                &lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-envelope fa-lg&quot;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/a&gt;\r\n                        &lt;/span&gt;\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                &lt;/nav&gt;\r\n                &lt;div class=&quot;content-wrapper&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;h2&gt;Collapsible Sidebar Using Bootstrap 4&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n                    &lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

&#39;Items&#39; -&gt; 0 -&gt;&gt; &#39;Item&#39; = &#39;abc&#39;\r\n\r\n`colb -&gt; &#39;Items&#39; -&gt; 0` returns the first array element of `Items` as a JSON value. And `-&gt;&gt; &#39;Item&#39;` then returns the key `&quot;Item&quot;` from within that JSON as a `text` (aka varchar) value.\r\n\r\nThis requires that `colb` is defined as `jsonb` (or at least `json`). If not, you need to cast it like this `colb::jsonb`. &lt;br&gt;\r\nBut in the long run you should really convert that column to `jsonb` then.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you want to search for `Item = &#39;abc&#39;` *anywhere* in the `Items` array (not just position 0), you can use the `@&gt;` operator: \r\n\r\n    select *\r\n    from data\r\n    where colb @&gt; &#39;{&quot;Items&quot;: [{&quot;Item&quot;: &quot;abc&quot;}]}&#39;;\r\n\r\nOnline example: https://rextester.com/BQWB24156\r\n\r\nThe above can use a GIN index on the column `colb`. The first query will require an index on _that_ expression. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWith Postgres 12 you can use a JSON path query like you have:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM table1 \r\n    where jsonb_path_exists(colb, &#39;$.Items[0].Item&#39; ? (@ == &quot;abc&quot;)&#39;);\r\n\r\nIf you want to search anywhere in the array, you can use:\r\n\r\n    SELECT * \r\n    FROM table1 \r\n    where jsonb_path_exists(colb, &#39;$.Items[*].Item&#39; ? (@ == &quot;abc&quot;)&#39;);\r\n\r\nThat again can not make use of a GIN index on the column, it would require an index on _that_ expression\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443593/postgres-statement-for-json-value/58444807#58444807","title":"Postgres statement for JSON_VALUE"}],"owner":{"reputation":17,"user_id":12158726,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3a41aad020229c073dc3fde8babf2360?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user12158726","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12158726/user12158726"},"last_editor":{"reputation":338685,"user_id":330315,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4b152262d9ba55197f609625358ff7e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"a_horse_with_no_name","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/330315/a-horse-with-no-name"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571380166,"creation_date":1571369720,"last_edit_date":1571380020,"question_id":58443593,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443593","body_markdown":"what is the postgres statement for this SQL statement.\r\n\r\n    SELECT * FROM table1 where JSON_VALUE(colB,&#39;$.Items[0].Item&#39;) =&#39;abc&#39;\r\n\r\ni have tried follow postgres document but result \r\nNo function matches the given name and argument types","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443593/postgres-statement-for-json-value","title":"Postgres statement for JSON_VALUE"},{"tags":["docker"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":713,"user_id":801343,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":44,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1181779036/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sivakumar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/801343/sivakumar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571376961,"post_id":58443589,"comment_id":103227720,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443589/docker-save-load-lose-parent-images#comment103227720_58443589"}],"owner":{"reputation":457,"user_id":9756912,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-RkF1Bgt1NFc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAA0/q4WmQ3vB1H4/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Archon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9756912/archon"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571369675,"creation_date":1571369675,"question_id":58443589,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58443589","body_markdown":"# # 0\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s assume there are images:\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

a bit hard to tell exactly what you&#39;re asking.

Expose an API for reading the value and your own logic checks for the value in the right order and force you clients to use the API, not read database or config file directly.\r\n\r\n2. Force the clients to all check for things in the proper order.\r\n\r\n3. Keep the config file up to date with the latest value so an outside developer can always just read the config file to get the latest value.  This means that any time a relevant value in the database is updated, you have to update the database.\r\n\r\n4. Read the config file values on startup into the database so you only have one storage place for the &quot;live&quot; values (the database).  Then force all clients to only read config values from the database.\r\n\r\n5. Get rid of the config file entirely and just store things in the database.

Boolean logic is flawed.\r\n\r\nThe opposite of (A and B and C) is (!A or !B or !C) -- if you negate the conditions, you need to switch operators.\r\n\r\nYour syntax is flawed. &quot;ELSE&quot; does need or allow a condition; its just the word &quot;ELSE&quot;\r\n\r\n&quot;ELSE IF&quot; is a whole different animal; that keyword in Python is ELIF and your condition should be something other than the diametric opposite of the condition in the IF.\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n````\r\nif a&gt;b and A&gt;B and R&lt;w&lt;a&lt;Q:\r\n   ... code will run when all conditions are true\r\nelif a&lt;b:\r\n   ... code will run when first initial condition failed\r\nelse:\r\n   ... code will run when A&lt;B or !(R&lt;w&lt;a&lt;Q)\r\n\r\n````\r\n\r\n2) The condition **R&amp;lt;w&amp;lt;a&amp;lt;Q** is invalid in most computer languages and would need to be a series of ANDed single inequality conditions, ie (R&amp;lt;w &amp;&amp; w&amp;lt;a &amp;&amp; a&amp;lt;Q)\r\n\r\n\r\nOr you could always nest\r\n\r\n````\r\nif a&gt;b :\r\n   if A&gt;B :\r\n      if R&lt;w and w&lt;a and a&lt;Q :\r\n         # your &quot;everything&#39;s true&quot; code\r\n

thing is when the connection fails, `channel` is `null` so you can&#39;t do `channel.stream` and the `StreamBuilder` can&#39;t have a `Stream`. So, one approach you could take is to have a `Stream` in the `WebSocket` that handles the retries and when the `channel` is ready, pass the data that comes from `channel.stream` to the `WebSocket` `Stream`.\r\n\r\nThis is how could be the `WebSocket`:\r\n\r\n    class WebSocket {\r\n      static WebSocket _instance;\r\n      final _streamController = StreamController.broadcast();\r\n      IOWebSocketChannel channel;\r\n    \r\n      static WebSocket get instance {\r\n        if (_instance == null) {\r\n          _instance = WebSocket();\r\n        }\r\n        return _instance;\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Stream get channelStream =&gt; _streamController.stream;\r\n    \r\n      Future init(int retries) async {\r\n        if (channel == null) {\r\n          await _tryToConnect(retries);\r\n          if (channel != null) {\r\n            _streamController.sink.add(null);\r\n            channel.stream.listen((value) {\r\n              _streamController.sink.add(value);\r\n            });\r\n          } else {\r\n            _streamController.sink.addError(&quot;Could not connect&quot;);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Future _tryToConnect(int retries) async {\r\n        if (channel == null) {\r\n          try {\r\n            String macAddress = await getMacAddress();\r\n            // This is to throw exception if it can&#39;t connect (https://github.com/dart-lang/web_socket_channel/issues/38#issuecomment-450383558)\r\n            final socket = await WebSocket.connect(\r\n                    &quot;ws://172.16.0.39:8001/ws/fsmart-door/$macAddress&quot;)\r\n                .timeout(_webSocketConnectionTimeout);\r\n            channel = IOWebSocketChannel(socket);\r\n          } catch (e) {\r\n            debugPrint(e.toString());\r\n          }\r\n          if (channel == null &amp;&amp; retries &gt; 0) {\r\n            _streamController.sink.addError(&quot;Retries left: ${retries - 1}&quot;);\r\n            await _tryToConnect(retries - 1);\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void close() =&gt; _streamController.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd this would be the `StreamBuilder`:\r\n\r\n    StreamBuilder(\r\n      stream: WebSocket.instance.channelStream,\r\n      builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n        if (snapshot.hasData) {\r\n          return Text(&#39;Data: ${snapshot.data}&#39;);\r\n        } else if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n          return Text(&#39;Error: ${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n        }\r\n        return Text(&#39;Loading...&#39;);\r\n      },\r\n    )\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to make a quick test of this solution, replace the two lines in the `try` `catch`, for this:\r\n\r\n    await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n    if (retries == 2) channel = IOWebSocketChannel();\r\n\r\nUse this `IOWebSocketChannel`\r\n\r\n    class IOWebSocketChannel {\r\n      var _streamController = StreamController&lt;String&gt;.broadcast();\r\n    \r\n      IOWebSocketChannel() {\r\n        init();\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      Stream get stream =&gt; _streamController.stream;\r\n    \r\n      Future init() async {\r\n        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n        _streamController.sink.add(&quot;1&quot;);\r\n        await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 3));\r\n        _streamController.sink.add(&quot;2&quot;);\r\n      }\r\n    \r\n      void close() =&gt; _streamController.close();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd use this example in a `StatefulWidget`:\r\n\r\n    @override\r\n    void initState() {\r\n      super.initState();\r\n      WebSocket.instance.init(5);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    @override\r\n    Widget build(BuildContext context) {\r\n      return Scaffold(\r\n        body: Center(\r\n          child: StreamBuilder(\r\n            stream: WebSocket.instance.channelStream,\r\n            builder: (context, snapshot) {\r\n              if (snapshot.hasData) {\r\n                return Text(&#39;Data: ${snapshot.data}&#39;);\r\n              } else if (snapshot.hasError) {\r\n                return Text(&#39;Error: ${snapshot.error}&#39;);\r\n              }\r\n              return Text(&#39;Loading...&#39;);\r\n            },\r\n          ),\r\n        ),\r\n      );\r\n

It&#39;s very difficult to understand the **precise** meaning of stuff you read on the internet, so I&#39;m hoping someone can read my theory of what&#39;s happening and point out any mistakes.\r\n\r\nSetup\r\n--\r\n\r\nSuppose I have a PCIe card with some memory on it. For the sake of discussion, assume the following concrete setup:\r\n\r\n- It has 4 MB to be accessed via base address register 0 (whatever that means)\r\n- It is the only PCIe card in the whole system\r\n- It is plugged into a PCIe slot, which connects to the root complex via copper wires in the motherboard\r\n- There is a root complex connected directly to the CPU&#39;s bus (is this the normal way things are connected?)\r\n- The PCIe card is somehow configured to be device number 0 (how is this done?)\r\n- We&#39;re using Linux.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s also settle on terminology:\r\n\r\n- The *system bus* is the CPU&#39;s own bus. \r\n- The *PCIe bus* refers the literal wires on the motherboard between the CPU and PCIe slot\r\n- A *driver* is a Linux kernel module\r\n- A *device* is a literal physical object\r\n- A *device struct* is the `pci_dev` structure filled by the kernel\r\n- A *BAR (base address register)* is the field inside a PCIe device&#39;s configuration space\r\n- A *BAR space* is the address space which is indicated (?) by the value in a BAR.\r\n\r\nMy theory of what&#39;s going on\r\n--\r\n\r\n1. At boot time, Linux starts probing different addresses to see if there&#39;s anything there.\r\n\r\n    - Since the PCIe bus wires are only connected to the system bus wires via a bridge (i.e. the PCIe controller on the system bus) Linux must know how to interact with the PCIe controller.\r\n    - Linux sends special commands to the PCIe controller (through memory-mapped IO?) that end up triggering the correct series of voltages on the PCIe wires\r\n    - If it gets a response, it will fill in a `pci_dev` struct with other information in the configuration space\r\n    - At some point in the future (when?) the kernel will iterate through the list of PCI drivers to try and match them to devices\r\n2. When Linux detects a device, it will map its BAR space into the system bus. (How is this done?) Suppose it maps the BAR0 space to address `0x55500000` to `0x5550FFFF` on the system bus.\r\n    - Linux must have to tell the root complex to listen to these addresses, and that they correspond to the PCIe card it detected.\r\n    - By the way, Linux will set base address register 0 on our PCIe card to have `0x55500000` in its base address field (why bother?)\r\n3. Subsequent writes on the system bus between `0x55500000` and `0x5550FFFF` are &quot;caught&quot; by the root complex, and issued out to the PCIe card\r\n    - The root complex will essentially build a packet will all the headers and checksums and the like and blast them out over the motherboard&#39;s copper wires to the PCIe slot\r\n4. Supposing the CPU wrote `0xDEADBEEF` to address `0x55501230` on the system bus, and that the root complex sent out the packet to the PCIe card, the card receives the packet and writes `0xDEADBEEF` to `0x01230` in its local 4 MB memory\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo: what parts of this are right and which are wrong?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58443506/precise-details-of-writing-a-byte-into-pcie-address-space-from-cpu","title":"Precise details of writing a byte into PCIe address
