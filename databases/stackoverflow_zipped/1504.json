These are more-or-less equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet bar1 = &amp;42;\r\nlet ref bar2 = 42;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in `let &amp;(ref a, ref b) = &amp;(3, 4)`, `a` and `b` both have the type `&amp;i32` — they are references. Also note that since *match ergonomics*, `let (a, b) = &amp;(3, 4)` is the same and shorter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the ampersand (`&amp;`) and asterisk (`*`) symbols are used for types. As you mention, pattern matching wants to &quot;line up&quot; the value with the pattern. The ampersand is already used to match and remove one layer of references in patterns: \r\n\r\n```\r\nlet foo: &amp;i32 = &amp;42;\r\n\r\nmatch foo {\r\n    &amp;v =&gt; println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy analogy, it&#39;s possible that some variant of this syntax **might** be supported in the future for raw pointers:\r\n\r\n```\r\nlet foo: *const i32 = std::ptr::null();\r\n\r\nmatch foo {\r\n    *v =&gt; println!(&quot;{}&quot;, v),\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince both ampersand and asterisk could be used to remove one layer of reference/pointer, they cannot be used to *add* one layer. Thus some new keyword was needed and `ref` was chosen.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/19066402/155423\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/36590549/155423\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/55130932/155423\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/56511328/155423\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/q/55625001/155423\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184472/why-is-ref-used-instead-of-an-asterisk-in-pattern-matching/58185593#58185593","title":"Why is `ref` used instead of an asterisk in pattern matching?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3658,"user_id":794457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d564695b517c0a1080a887633a40b1e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"edwardw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/794457/edwardw"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3658,"user_id":794457,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d564695b517c0a1080a887633a40b1e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"edwardw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/794457/edwardw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569937080,"last_edit_date":1569937080,"creation_date":1569936400,"answer_id":58185801,"question_id":58184472,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58185801","body_markdown":"In this specific case, you can achieve the same with neither `ref` nor asterisk:\r\n\r\n```rust\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let (a, b) = &amp;(3, 4);\r\n    \r\n    show_type_name(a);\r\n    show_type_name(b);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn show_type_name&lt;T&gt;(_: T) {\r\n    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, std::any::type_name::&lt;T&gt;()); // rust 1.38.0 and above\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt shows both `a` and `b` to be of type `&amp;i32`.

For `g2`, all edges could be launched in parallel. \r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The above is **not** a rigidly proven algorithm, merely just an implementation idea. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search\r\n  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184464/introducing-parallelism-to-a-task-scheduling-problem/58185131#58185131","title":"Introducing &quot;parallelism&quot; to a task scheduling problem"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":111,"user_id":2711184,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/201bd18c7a1781598f1c805451815674?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Vincenzo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2711184/vincenzo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569939331,"post_id":58185896,"comment_id":102753106,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184464/introducing-parallelism-to-a-task-scheduling-problem/58185896#comment102753106_58185896"},{"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11226409,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f73e14884a860f9869f61fd7be21637?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tobs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11226409/tobs"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569947619,"post_id":58185896,"comment_id":102757715,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184464/introducing-parallelism-to-a-task-scheduling-problem/58185896#comment102757715_58185896"},{"owner":{"reputation":1179,"user_id":492307,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8085cc47ff63666ad11f782ea46325d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tryer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/492307/tryer"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569948281,"post_id":58185896,"comment_id":102757982,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184464/introducing-parallelism-to-a-task-scheduling-problem/58185896#comment102757982_58185896"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1179,"user_id":492307,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8085cc47ff63666ad11f782ea46325d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tryer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/492307/tryer"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1179,"user_id":492307,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":96,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8085cc47ff63666ad11f782ea46325d4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Tryer","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/492307/tryer"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569948533,"last_edit_date":1569948533,"creation_date":1569936732,"answer_id":58185896,"question_id":58184464,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58185896","body_markdown":"Assuming you mean that if there is an arc in your graph from `v` to `u`, then `v` must be completed before `u` can be started.\r\n\r\nThis is simply finding the shortest project completion time, when you think of the graph as a project precedence graph.

That is, at most K tasks can be worked on at the same time. Clearly, the time needed the complete all tasks will depend on K. \r\n\r\nThis problem is known as Precedence Constrained Scheduling. \r\n\r\nIf the number of workers K is larger or equal to the number of tasks N, then the solution outlined by Tryer is correct: the weight of the heaviest path in your dependency DAG will give you the time required. (The heaviest path is sometimes called the *critical path* and it can be computed in linear time using a specific shortest path algorithm.)\r\n\r\nIf K = 1, as you already noticed you just follow a topological order and the time required will be the sum of the tasks&#39; times. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in the interesting case where 1 &lt; K &lt; N, this is a hard (NP-hard) optimization problem and all algorithms known to compute the optimal solution are inefficient. However, you can still get an approximately optimal solution by feeding the topological order to a so-called *list scheduling* algorithm. The idea of list scheduling is very simple. At each step of the algorithm, you cycle through all your K workers. For any of them that is idle, you assign an unassigned task that is available and the dependencies of which have been already satisfied. Then you mark that task as assigned and continue. After all workers are busy or cannot be assigned other tasks, you then wait for some of the tasks to complete, and resume the algorithm as before. \r\n\r\nIt can be proven rigorously that the time T&#39; at which the list scheduling algorithm will complete the last task is at most T* + P where T* is the optimal time and P is the weight of the critical path. Thus the algorithm will work well if the tasks on the critical path are a small fraction of the total. \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184464/introducing-parallelism-to-a-task-scheduling-problem/58186727#58186727","title":"Introducing &quot;parallelism&quot; to a task scheduling problem"}],"owner":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11226409,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f73e14884a860f9869f61fd7be21637?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tobs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11226409/tobs"},"last_editor":{"reputation":15,"user_id":11226409,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7f73e14884a860f9869f61fd7be21637?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tobs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11226409/tobs"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58185896,"answer_count":3,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569948533,"creation_date":1569931710,"last_edit_date":1569945547,"question_id":58184464,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58184464","body_markdown":"Parallelism in qoutes as I&#39;m not actually referring to parallell programming (Threads/Forking etc.)\r\n\r\nCurrently working on a dependency graph problem, where given a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) where each vertex represents a task that must be completed, and an edge from one vertex *v* to another vertex *u* means that *v* must be completed before *u* can be completed.

They all stem from the `setup_and` method, and are highlighted by the compiler when you explicitly described the lifetime bounds.\r\n\r\nThe body of your method is copied below, with annotations for you to understand the issue:\r\n\r\n    let mut v: Vec&lt;&amp;Foo&gt; = vec![];\r\n    let other_foo = Foo {}; // other_foo is created here\r\n\r\n    f(&amp;mut v);\r\n    v.push(&amp;other_foo); // other_foo requires lifetime &#39;a to be added to this\r\n    consume(v); // consume does not restrict the lifetime requirement &#39;a\r\n    // other_foo is dropped here, at lifetime less than &#39;a\r\n\r\nThe easiest solution to this problem is to store an `Arc&lt;Foo&gt;`, like so ([playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=7b4563d510765d3d856b34642b704ecc)):\r\n\r\n    fn setup_and&lt;F&gt;(f: F)\r\n    where\r\n        F: FnOnce(&amp;mut Vec&lt;Arc&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;) + Send,\r\n    {\r\n        let mut v: Vec&lt;Arc&lt;Foo&gt;&gt; = vec![];\r\n        let other_foo = Foo {};\r\n    \r\n        f(&amp;mut v);\r\n        v.push(Arc::new(other_foo));\r\n        consume(&amp;mut v);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n`Arc` is an Atomic Reference-Counting pointer. It is a clonable structure that works as a dynamic pointer to an object on the heap; for all intents and purposes, it works as a read-only reference, without the requirement for a lifetime. When all copies of an `Arc` are dropped, the item inside it is also dropped.\r\n\r\nThis solves two problems:\r\n\r\n1. Your `other_foo` is now **moved** into the `Arc`, and no longer causes its lifetime issue\r\n2. You can now access your objects just like you would a reference (`Arc` implements `Deref`)\r\n\r\nThe choice of `Arc` was made because your `FnOnce` requires `Send`, which `Rc` (the single-threaded variant of `Arc`) cannot provide.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184443/how-to-bind-reference-lifetime-to-a-function-local-scope/58184678#58184678","title":"How to bind reference lifetime to a function local scope"}],"owner":{"reputation":25,"user_id":4667629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53fcd2dc8cea9c2ce3902a13364fcb28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Theof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4667629/theof"},"last_editor":{"reputation":25,"user_id":4667629,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/53fcd2dc8cea9c2ce3902a13364fcb28?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Theof","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4667629/theof"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":78,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58184678,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569932776,"creation_date":1569931634,"last_edit_date":1569932776,"question_id":58184443,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58184443","body_markdown":"I want to write a function A which takes as parameter a function B which takes as parameter a type which is parameterized by a reference type which lifetime is at least the lifetime of the local variables in A’s body.\r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n```rust\r\nstruct Foo {}\r\n\r\nfn consume(mut v: Vec&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;) {\r\n    while let Some(..) = v.pop() {\r\n        // Do stuff\r\n        continue;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn setup_and&lt;F&gt;(f: F)\r\nwhere\r\n    F: FnOnce(&amp;mut Vec&lt;&amp;Foo&gt;) + Send,\r\n{\r\n    let mut v: Vec&lt;&amp;Foo&gt; = vec![];\r\n    let other_foo = Foo {};\r\n\r\n    f(&amp;mut v);\r\n    v.push(&amp;other_foo);\r\n    consume(v);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfn main() {\r\n    let foo = Foo {};\r\n    setup_and(|v| {\r\n        v.push(&amp;foo);\r\n    });\r\n}\r\n```\r\nrustc cannot infer lifetimes on its own.

I assume it is because it wants a larger lifetime than the scope of `setup_and`.\r\n\r\nHow would I bind lifetimes correctly in that case ?

These problems occur on both SQL Azure and Sql Server 2016\r\n\r\n    declare @timezone as varchar(max) = &#39;Alaskan Standard Time&#39;\r\n    select cast(cast(GETUTCDATE() as datetimeoffset) at time zone @timeZone as datetime) -- this works\r\n    \r\n    set @timezone = &#39;Cabo Verde Standard Time&#39;\r\n    select cast(cast(GETUTCDATE() as datetimeoffset) at time zone @timeZone as datetime) -- does not work\r\n    \r\n    set @timezone = &#39;Coordinated Universal Time&#39;\r\n    select cast(cast(GETUTCDATE() as datetimeoffset) at time zone @timeZone as datetime) -- does not work\r\n\r\n\r\nThis results in \r\n\r\n\r\n    (1 row affected)\r\n    Msg 9820, Level 16, State 1, Line 411\r\n    The time zone parameter &#39;Cabo Verde Standard Time&#39; provided to AT TIME ZONE clause is invalid.\r\n    Msg 9820, Level 16, State 1, Line 414\r\n    The time zone parameter &#39;Coordinated Universal Time&#39; provided to AT TIME ZONE clause is invalid.\r\n\r\nSo I discover that SQL has its own list that is different to that of .Net. So the immediate thought to not use .Net to get the list. Rather, I should simply ask SQL Server via a query.  \r\n\r\n    select * from sys.time_zone_info\r\n\r\nThe problem with this approach is that this returns a different and incompatible list to that of .Net.  In my .Net code I have some code like this\r\n\r\n    TimeZoneInfo.FromSerializedString(project.TimeZone)\r\n\r\nThis will break if it uses an unknown string that SQL Server knows about.\r\n\r\n&gt; Fun fact #1, the documentation at\r\n&gt; https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/queries/at-time-zone-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017\r\n&gt; states that the list is sourced from\r\n&gt; &quot;KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Time\r\n&gt; Zones&quot;. Sure enough, &#39;Coordinated Universal Time&#39; is not in the list\r\n&gt; (and it does not work).  But  &#39;Cabo Verde Standard Time&#39; IS in the\r\n&gt; list (but that does not work either).  \r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Fun fact #2, &quot;Cabo Verde Standard&quot; does not work but &quot;Cape Verde\r\n&gt; Standard Time&quot; does work.  These are not typos. These are actual\r\n&gt; timezones.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; (Before someone asks, I converted the GetUTCDate() into a\r\n&gt; datetimeoffset as the documentation says &quot;If inputdate is provided as\r\n&gt; a datetimeoffset value, then AT TIME ZONE clause converts it into the\r\n&gt; target time zone using the time zone conversion rules.&quot; which is what\r\n&gt; I wanted to happen).\r\n\r\nSo, the question...  what am I to do?  What have others done?  This whole area appears to be a total dog&#39;s breakfast.\r\n\r\nI guess my problem is that I have timezone processing both in the stored procs and .Net and their timezone processing is incompatible.  I probably should somehow just do one and not the other.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184439/t-sql-at-time-zone-does-not-know-all-of-the-timezones-that-net-knows-about","title":"t-sql &#39;at time zone&#39; does not know all of the timezones that .net knows about"},{"tags":["javascript","c#","asp.net-mvc"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":149,"user_id":7461493,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9906023f36543d9d8ca767bf93523919?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kris.J","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7461493/kris-j"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569932476,"post_id":58184438,"comment_id":102748911,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184438/how-to-compare-two-dates-and-apply-validation-regarding-that#comment102748911_58184438"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12123662,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/3161210260588210/picture?type=large","display_name":"Ankur Prakash","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12123662/ankur-prakash"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5866,"user_id":6170890,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rIxw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nino","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6170890/nino"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569934001,"creation_date":1569931618,"last_edit_date":1569934001,"question_id":58184438,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58184438","body_markdown":"I have created an order summary page in my project.

We can then ignore the y value from the discussion.\r\nYou didn&#39;t specify anything about the size of the grid. Assuming it is\r\nregular, we can create two arrays representing the separating lines between grid blocks (the values will be different for you data). Notice that I have added np.inf as the last element.\r\n```python\r\ngrid_x_lim = np.concatenate([np.arange(-1.5, 1.6, 0.5), [np.inf]])\r\ngrid_z_lim = np.concatenate([np.arange(-20, 21, 10), [np.inf]])\r\n```\r\nThe idea is that any point with x coordinate below -1.5 is in the left of the first vertical line while any point with z coordinate below -20 is below the first horizontal line and so on.\r\n\r\nFor the sample data below (from you example code)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nplt.figure()\r\nax = plt.axes(projection=&quot;3d&quot;)\r\nplt.xlabel(&#39;X&#39;)\r\nplt.ylabel(&#39;Y&#39;)\r\nax.set_zlabel(&#39;Z&#39;)\r\n\r\n(x, y) = np.meshgrid(np.arange(-2, 2.1, .1), np.arange(-1, 1.1, .1))\r\nz = 3*x**3-2*y**2\r\n\r\nx = x.ravel()\r\ny = y.ravel()\r\nz = z.ravel()\r\n\r\nax.plot3D(x, y, z, linestyle = &#39;&#39;, marker =&#39;.&#39;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n[![3D plot of the original data][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nwe get (only plotting x-z coordinated here)\r\n```python\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1,1)\r\nfor x_coord in grid_x_lim[:-1]:  # Plot vertical lines\r\n    ax.axvline(x_coord)\r\nfor z_coord in grid_z_lim[:-1]:  # Plot horizontal lines\r\n    ax.axhline(z_coord)\r\nax.plot(x, z, &quot;.&quot;)  # We are only ploting the x-z values\r\nax.set_xlabel(&quot;x&quot;)\r\nax.set_ylabel(&quot;z&quot;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n[![plot of the data in the x-z plane with the grid][2]][2]\r\n\r\nThe plot seems fine, but we still need to separate the data into the grid. Now we use `grid_x_lim` and `grid_z_lim` to find the index in the grid for each point in the original data.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nx_idx = np.argmax(x &lt; grid_x_lim[:, np.newaxis], axis=0)\r\nz_idx = np.argmax(z &lt; grid_z_lim[:, np.newaxis], axis=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you want a linear index instead of two indexes, we can get it with\r\n```python\r\nlinear_idx = z_idx * grid_z_lim.size + x_idx\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `linear_idx` variable has the same dimension of your `x`, `y`, and `z` variables and it indicates the index of the block in the grid where a point falls.\r\nLet&#39;s check that it worked. We can repeat the previous plot but we will\r\nplot the points in each block with a different color.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1)\r\nfor x_coord in grid_x_lim[:-1]:\r\n    ax.axvline(x_coord)\r\nfor z_coord in grid_z_lim[:-1]:\r\n    ax.axhline(z_coord)\r\n\r\ncolors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;cyan&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;magenta&quot;]\r\ncolor_idx = 0\r\nfor i in range(grid_x_lim.size * grid_z_lim.size):\r\n    desired_linear_idx = i  # Change this to different values and check the plot\r\n    mask = linear_idx == desired_linear_idx\r\n    if(sum(mask) &gt; 0):\r\n        ax.plot(x[mask], z[mask], &quot;.&quot;, color=colors[color_idx])\r\n        color_idx = (color_idx + 1) % len(colors)\r\n\r\nax.set_xlabel(&quot;x&quot;)\r\nax.set_ylabel(&quot;z&quot;)\r\nplt.show()\r\n```\r\n[![plot of the data with separated colors][3]][3]\r\n\r\n**Note**: The linear index starts at the bottom left and increases from left to right followed from bottom to top. But it should be easy to adjust the code if you really need it starting from top left.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/FfO22.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/fwHq9.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/XsudN.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184390/is-there-a-way-to-sort-3d-coordinates-in-segments/58187327#58187327","title":"Is there a way to sort 3D coordinates in segments?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12095529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCV1Xh9K21JIU05iUwZCDjR3kgZVdzFLoSFW3KaWA=k-s128","display_name":"theo lam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095529/theo-lam"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":12095529,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCV1Xh9K21JIU05iUwZCDjR3kgZVdzFLoSFW3KaWA=k-s128","display_name":"theo lam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12095529/theo-lam"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569941161,"creation_date":1569931417,"last_edit_date":1569933775,"question_id":58184390,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58184390","body_markdown":"I have a set of coordinates (x, y and z), that describe the surface of a face.

ended up implementing a write-through cache as suggested by Val. This makes it possible to remove the call to `Refresh` but still make the count on each iteration. This is implemented using a singleton `MemoryCache` shared between all threads:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar cache = new MemoryCache(&quot;hashes&quot;);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen checking for uniqueness I check the cache in case no similar documents are found in Elasticsearch:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar result = elasticClient\r\n    .Count&lt;MyDocument&gt;(c =&gt; c\r\n        .Index(indexName)\r\n        .Query(q =&gt; q\r\n            .ConstantScore(qs =&gt; qs\r\n                .Filter(f =&gt; f\r\n                    .Term(field =&gt; field.Hash, hash)))));\r\n\r\nbool isUnique = false;\r\nif (result.Count == 0)\r\n{\r\n    isUnique = !cache.Contains(hash);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn case the count for the hash returns `0` I check a cache for that hash. \r\n\r\nWhen a document has been successful indexed, I store the hash in the cache with an expiration:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar policy = new CacheItemPolicy();\r\npolicy.AbsoluteExpiration = DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.AddSeconds(5);\r\ncache.AddOrGetExisting(hash, string.Empty, policy);\r\n```\r\n\r\nTTL could probably be 1 second as well since that is the refresh interval I currently have configured on the index.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58184386/uniqueness-check-in-elasticsearch-without-constantly-refreshing-index/58213934#58213934","title":"Uniqueness check in Elasticsearch without constantly refreshing index"}],"owner":{"reputation":3271,"user_id":758765,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f3fed18422c9db37c455728ecf3f880c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ThomasArdal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/758765/thomasardal"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":43,"favorite_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570086302,"creation_date":1569931392,"question_id":58184386,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58184386","body_markdown":"I&#39;m indexing a lot of data in Elasticsearch (through NEST) from multiple processes each running multiple threads. Part of indexing a document is finding out if we have seen a similar document before. This feature is implemented by generating a hash of a set of fields on the document and checking if we have documents in Elasticsearch with the same hash. Before indexing a document, I make the following query:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar result = elasticClient\r\n    .Index(indexName)\r\n    .Count&lt;MyDocument&gt;(c =&gt; c\r\n        .Query(q =&gt; q\r\n            .ConstantScore(qs =&gt; qs\r\n                .Filter(f =&gt; f\r\n                    .Term(field =&gt; field.Hash, hash))))\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis returns a count of existing documents with the specified `hash`. So far so good. Things are working. If a process is indexing two documents with the same hash within the same second, the count check doesn&#39;t work, since the first document isn&#39;t available for search yet. I&#39;m running with the default refresh interval (1 second). For now I have added a refresh call after indexing each document:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar refreshResponse = client.Refresh(indexName);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also works but it doesn&#39;t scale when indexing large amounts of documents (indexing becomes slow as already pointed out here: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/tune-for-indexing-speed.html).\r\n\r\nAny ideas for how to avoid having to call `Refresh` but still be able to perform a uniqueness check? I&#39;m thinking some sort of local cache shared between all threads with hashes of documents indexed since the last refresh.

First of all, **don&#39;t use `-P` when running your mysql container**. `-P` (or `--publish-all`) will _publish_ the ports of the MySQL container, which means **MySQL will be accessible publicly**. This is likely not what you want.\r\n\r\nContainers can connect with each-other using the docker container-container network; if both containers are connected to the same network, they can connect with each-other over that network, without having to make the ports publicly accessible. Only use `-p` (or `-P`) to make ports accessible that should be public.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example;\r\n\r\n### 1. Create a custom network;\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker network create myprivatenetwork\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Start the mysql container\r\n\r\nStart the mysql container, and connect it to the `myprivatenetwork`. I removed the `-P` option, which means the container is not publicly accessible, but it is accessible from network(s) it&#39;s connected to. (I wrapped the commands to make it easier to read)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  --name mysql-test \\\r\n  --network myprivatenetwork \\\r\n  -v storage-test:/var/lib/mysql \\\r\n  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \\\r\n  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=MyDataBase \\\r\n  -e MYSQL_USER=me \\\r\n  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=mepass \\\r\n  -d \\\r\n  mysql:5.7\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; **Note**: I used `mysql:5.7`, because `mysql:latest` (which currently is MySQL 8) requires some additional configuration; see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52364415/php-with-mysql-8-0-error-the-server-requested-authentication-method-unknown-to\r\n&gt; In general, it&#39;s recommended to be specific about the version you want to run, and don&#39;t run `:latest`, as it may change to newer versions, which can cause your setup to fail.\r\n\r\n### 3. Start the PhpMyAdmin container\r\n\r\nStart the PhpMyAdmin container, and connect it to the same network; phpmyadmin can connect with the mysql container using its _name_ (`mysql-test`) as hostname, and using the default \r\nmysql port (`3306`). For the phpmyadmin container, I kept `-p` to allow accessing it publicly (although you may want to have it run with TLS/SSL)\r\n\r\n```\r\ndocker run \\\r\n  --name myadmin \\\r\n  --network myprivatenetwork \\\r\n  -d \\\r\n  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root \\\r\n  -e PMA_HOST=mysql-test \\\r\n  -e PMA_PORT=3306 \\\r\n  -e PMA_VERBOSE=mysql-test \\\r\n  -e PMA_USER=me \\\r\n  -e PMA_PASSWORD=mepass  \\\r\n  -p 8080:80 \\\r\n  phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 4.

Then run your pyautogui script in this virtual operating system. You operating system is available in window-like container - so you can minimize this window with running script, and you system where you can interact as a user.

you want to set is called &quot;REST API id&quot; and is generated by API Gateway when creating the API. The [API][1] used to create API&#39;s in API Gateway doesn&#39;t offer the ability to specify the REST API id, so no, there is no way to specify the id.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that is probably that these id&#39;s are used as part of a public facing domain name. As this domain name doesn&#39;t include an identifier for the AWS account it belongs to, the id&#39;s have to be globally unique, so AWS generates them to avoid collisions. As [AWS puts it][2] (emphasis by me):\r\n\r\n&gt;  For an edge-optimized API, the base URL is of the `http[s]://*{restapi-id}*.execute-api.amazonaws.com/stage` format, where *{restapi-id}* is the API&#39;s [id][3] value **generated by API Gateway**. You can assign a custom domain name (for example, apis.example.com) as the API&#39;s host name and call the API with a base URL of the `https://apis.example.com/myApi` format. \r\n\r\nFor the option to create a custom domain name you should consider that there is even some more complexity associated with it, as you must provision a matching SSL-certificate for the domain as well. While you can use [ACM][4] for that, there is currently the limitation that SSL-certificates for CloudFront distributions (which edge-optimized API Gateway API&#39;s use behind the scenes) [need to be issued in us-east-1][5].\r\n\r\nThe option you already mentioned to export the API endpoint in the CloudFormation stack as output value and use that exported value in your other stack would work well. As you noted that&#39;d create a dependency between the two stacks, so once you deployed project 2, which uses the output value from project 1, you can only delete the CloudFormation stack for project 1 after the project 2 stack is either deleted or updated to not use the exported value anymore. That can be a feature, but from your description it sounds like it wouldn&#39;t for your use case.\r\n\r\nSomething similar to exported stack output values would be to use some shared storage instead of making use of CloudFormation&#39;s exported output values features. What comes to mind here is the [SSM Parameter Store][6], which offers some [integration into CloudFormation][7]. The integration makes it easy to read a parameter from the SSM Parameter Store in the stack of project 2. For writing the value to the Parameter Store in project 1 you&#39;d need to use a [custom resource][8] in your CloudFormation template. There is at least one [sample implementation][9] for that available on Github.\r\n\r\nAs you can see there are multiple options available to solve your problem.

I am using Hortonworks so I need to use the [Hive WarehouseConnector][1].\r\n\r\nRunning one or even multiple queries is easy and works. My problem is that I want to issue `set` commands before. For instance to set the dag name in tez ui: `set hive.query.name=something relevant` or to set up some memory configuration `set hive.tez.container.size = 8192`. For these statements to take effect, they need to run on the same session than the main query and that&#39;s my issue.\r\n\r\nI tried 2 ways:\r\n\r\nThe first one was to generate a new hive session **for each query**, with a properly setup url eg.:\r\n\r\n    url=&#39;jdbc:hive2://hiveserver:10000/default?hive.query.name=relevant&#39;\r\n    builder = HiveWarehouseSession.session(self.spark)\r\n    builder.hs2url(url)\r\n    hive = builder.build()\r\n    hive.execute(&quot;select * from whatever&quot;)\r\n\r\nIt works well for the first query, but the same url is reused for the next one (even if I try to manually delete `builder` and `hive`), so does not work.\r\n\r\nThe second way is to set `spark.sql.hive.thriftServer.singleSession=true` globally in the spark thrift server. This does seem to work, but I find it a shame to limit the global spark thrift server for the benefit of one application only.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to achieve what I am looking for?

For example, I have device model registration form.\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1q-_ii_V7SWDBFvUJGw0cd2BEWP3BnM0H\r\n\r\n\r\nModel has a Name, a Specification, a Device Type and a Manufacturer that define it. This is the actual Model class that I use:\r\n\r\n    public class Models\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate DeviceTypes deviceType;\r\n    \tprivate Manufacturers manufacturer;\r\n    \tprivate String name;\r\n    \r\n        //getters and setters\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis is further part of a HashMap that contains all Models with their ID.\r\n\r\n    public Map&lt;Integer,Models&gt; modelsTable = new HashMap&lt;Integer, Models&gt;();\r\n\r\nI want to be able to add and remove items from JComboBox and to select actual data repersesnted with JComboBox items to create new models with those objects.\r\nWhat is the standard way to do this? I have created a ComboBox renderer:\r\n\r\n    public class DeviceTypeRenderer extends BasicComboBoxRenderer\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate static final long serialVersionUID = 3442865560696889757L;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList&lt;?&gt; list, Object value, int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tif (value instanceof DeviceTypes)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tvalue = ((DeviceTypes)value).getName();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tsuper.getListCellRendererComponent(list, value, index, isSelected, cellHasFocus);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\treturn this;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public class ManufacturersRenderer extends BasicComboBoxRenderer\r\n    {\r\n    \tprivate static final long serialVersionUID = 3723328665061573656L;\r\n    \r\n    \tpublic Component getListCellRendererComponent(JList&lt;?&gt; list, Object value,int index, boolean isSelected, boolean cellHasFocus)\r\n    \t{\r\n    \t\tif (value instanceof Manufacturers)\r\n    \t\t{\r\n    \t\t\tvalue = ((Manufacturers)value).getName();\r\n    \t\t}\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\tsuper.getListCellRendererComponent(list, value, index, isSelected, cellHasFocus);\r\n    \t\t\r\n    \t\treturn this;\r\n    \t}\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd then I just add or remove them as data objects.\r\n\r\n    DeviceTypes deviceType = new DeviceTypes(name,description);\r\n    \r\n    comboBoxDeviceType.addItem(deviceType);\r\n\r\nAnd JComboBox displayes `deviceType.getName();`\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best way to do the reverse. To get a actual data class form JComboBox item selection? I probably did all this the wrong way and am using lot of bad practice. If you see that please inform me to correct myself, and I would appreciate it if you could show me how to implement this correctly.

h:mm:ss&#39;);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

seen that a lot of questions have already asked this, but it seems to be very specific as none of the answers seem to work.\r\n\r\nLet me explain the steps that I have taken to install everything:\r\n\r\nI started with installing Python 3.7.4 and installed tensorflow after that. The command I ran is: `pip install -q tensorflow=2.0.0-alpha0`. This didn&#39;t seem to work and I soon figured out that this is because of the version of Python. Tensorflow doesn&#39;t support 3.7 yet, so I installed Python 3.6.0.\r\n\r\nI then installed tensorflow again with the following command: `pip3.6 install tensorflow`. Note the explicit `pip3.6`. I then select python 3.6 in the configuration of Visual Code&#39;s Python Debugger. I ran the following code (single line) and gave me the following error:\r\n\r\n**Python**\r\n```\r\nimport tensorflow as tf\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Output**\r\n```\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\__init__.py&quot;, line 98, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    from tensorflow_core import *\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow_core\\__init__.py&quot;, line 40, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    from tensorflow.python.tools import module_util as _module_util\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\__init__.py&quot;, line 50, in __getattr__\r\n    module = self._load()\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow\\__init__.py&quot;, line 44, in _load\r\n    module = _importlib.import_module(self.__name__)\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\importlib\\__init__.py&quot;, line 126, in import_module\r\n    return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow_core\\python\\__init__.py&quot;, line 52, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    from tensorflow.core.framework.graph_pb2 import *\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\tensorflow_core\\core\\framework\\graph_pb2.py&quot;, line 7, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    from google.protobuf import descriptor as _descriptor\r\n  File &quot;C:\\Program Files\\Python36\\lib\\site-packages\\google\\protobuf\\descriptor.py&quot;, line 47, in &lt;module&gt;\r\n    from google.protobuf.pyext import _message\r\nImportError: DLL load failed: The specified module could not be found.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some searching, [someone said][1] that uninstalling tensorflow-estimator and tensorflow-gpu may work, because of unsupported gpu&#39;s.
