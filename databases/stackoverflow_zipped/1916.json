is because the response you get from the `Weather API` is an `object` an not an `Array`. Therefore it is not iterable.\r\n\r\n## Updated\r\nYou try to iterate over the object which is not feasible in `Angular`. \r\n\r\nThere are 2 things you could do:\r\n### 1. Use the [`KeyValuePairPipe`](https://angular.io/api/common/KeyValuePipe) to show a list of key value. Here is one of my [favorite explanation](https://codecraft.tv/courses/angular/pipes/built-in-pipes/) on how they work and how to build one.\r\n\r\nIn your template\r\n```\r\n&lt;button (click)=&quot;getWeather()&quot;&gt;clcik me&lt;/button&gt;\r\n&lt;h2 *ngFor=&quot;let data of Data | keyvalue&quot;&gt;{{data.key}}: {{data.value}}&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this approach will only display the value associated with a key. Meaning that an array will be displayed as `[...]`\r\n\r\n### 2.

app.\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/api-management/api-management-howto-deploy-multi-region\r\n\r\nmy policies look like \r\n\r\n    &lt;policies&gt;\r\n        &lt;inbound&gt;\r\n            &lt;base /&gt;\r\n            &lt;choose&gt;\r\n                &lt;when condition=&quot;@(context.Request.OriginalUrl.Host.Contains(&quot;centralus-01.regional&quot;))&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;set-backend-service base-url=&quot;https://apiservtmt.trafficmanager.net/api/&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;/when&gt;\r\n                &lt;when condition=&quot;@(context.Request.OriginalUrl.Host.Contains(&quot;southeastasia-01.regional&quot;))&quot;&gt;\r\n                    &lt;set-backend-service

base-url=&quot;https://apiservtmt.trafficmanager.net/api/&quot; /&gt;\r\n                &lt;/otherwise&gt;\r\n            &lt;/choose&gt;\r\n        &lt;/inbound&gt;\r\n        &lt;backend&gt;\r\n            &lt;base /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/backend&gt;\r\n        &lt;outbound&gt;\r\n            &lt;base /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/outbound&gt;\r\n        &lt;on-error&gt;\r\n            &lt;base /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/on-error&gt;\r\n    &lt;/policies&gt;\r\n\r\nbut unfortunately even though i set the inbound policy to change the base url, post inbound policy is applied, the url is again getting reset to the original azure function that I had used to associate the apis with the api management.\r\nu can see in the trace log, even after setting it to the base url of my desired choice its getting reset.\r\nI tried every possible policy compbination, but still issue persists, please help.\r\n\r\n\r\n    api-inspector (0.322 ms)\r\n    {\r\n        &quot;request&quot;: {\r\n

been working on code to identify cables in a Visio drawing based on the connector shapes that make up the cable.\r\n\r\nMy code is mostly implemented at this point. Currently it:\r\n\r\n 1. Identifies &quot;connector&quot; shapes in the drawing  \r\n 2. Checks what other shapes they are connected with using vsoShape.connectedShapes(visConnectedShapesAllNodes, &quot;&quot;)  \r\n 3. Prints the Found Connectors (original connector shape, and linked connector shapess)   \r\n 4. Runs through a series of if/elseif statements to identify cable based on the connectors found and optional user input for length (some cables use the same connectors)    \r\n 5. Prints a number that identifies the cable\r\n\r\nSuccessful output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFound Connector: USB A - top.6\r\nShapes connected:\r\nUSB Micro B.113\r\n\r\nCABLE INFO\r\nConnector 1: USB A - top.6\r\nConnector 2: USB Micro B.113\r\nConnector 3: None\r\nCable Length: 1 m\r\nCable #: 812943-0010\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works for over 95% of my drawing. However, I am having an issue where sometimes a shape&#39;s name will be returned as &quot;sheet.xxx&quot; as seen below:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFound Connector: USB A - top.199\r\nShapes connected:\r\nSheet.211\r\n\r\nCABLE INFO\r\nConnector 1: USB A - top.199\r\nConnector 2: Sheet.211\r\nConnector 3: None\r\nCable Length: 0\r\nCable #: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFound Connector: USB A Female\r\nShapes connected:\r\n\r\nCABLE INFO\r\nConnector 1: USB A Female\r\nConnector 2: \r\nConnector 3: None\r\nCable Length: 0\r\nCable #: \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere it says &quot;Sheet.211&quot;, the returned name *should* have been &quot;USB A Female&quot;. Then, for the &quot;USB A Female&quot; shape, the shape connected should have been &quot;USB A - top.199&quot; instead of coming back blank.\r\n\r\nI have tried re-adding the shapes to my drawing and re-connecting them with a dynamic connector but the issue persists. Has anyone else come across this? Could there be something wrong with the shapes, since they are part of a custom stencil?\r\n\r\nBelow is the code from my module:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOption Explicit \r\n\r\nPublic LengthAndNum As Variant

You can see what is actually running using the netstat tool (available on OS X, Windows, and Linux, with command line syntax varying across all three)\r\n\r\nIf you&#39;re on a mac, and you are using the default postgres install, scrap that and install it via homebrew. \r\n\r\nWhat ends up happening is that the user installs Pg and starts a server from one packaging, but uses the psql and libpq client from a different packaging. Typically this occurs when they&#39;re running Postgres.app or homebrew Pg and connecting with the psql that shipped with the OS. Not only do these sometimes have different default ports, but the Pg that shipped with Mac OS X has a different default unix socket path, so even if the server is running on the same port it won&#39;t be listening to the same unix socket.\r\n\r\nMost Mac users work around this by just using tcp/ip with psql -h localhost. You can also specify a port if required, eg psql -h localhost -p 5433. You might have multiple PostgreSQL instances running so make sure you&#39;re connecting to the right one by using select version() and SHOW data_directory;.\r\n\r\nFurther answers to this can be found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15100368/postgresql-port-confusion-5433-or-5432","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085888/postgresql-cant-connect-to-server/58086378#58086378","title":"Postgresql can&#39;t connect to server?"}],"owner":{"reputation":29,"user_id":3606589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09d65990ffa0e58ef4258640f4934e3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zuse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3606589/zuse"},"last_editor":{"reputation":29,"user_id":3606589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/09d65990ffa0e58ef4258640f4934e3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Zuse","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3606589/zuse"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":77,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569361887,"creation_date":1569348103,"last_edit_date":1569361887,"question_id":58085888,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085888","body_markdown":"I am new to postgresql and rails.

First of all I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;ve been a professional developer for quite a few years but I&#39;ve always developed on different environments (mostly GNU/Linux and MacOS) and when it comes to Windows for me it has always been more of a gaming OS than a working one; now that Windows 10 seems to be more open-source friendly I&#39;d like to give it a shot and see if by combining WSL-2 and vcpkg I can have something working.  So I thought that developing a simple cross-platform 2D application using the allegro library could have been a good idea.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve created a new CMake project using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition, and set-up a vcpkg clone inside the project itself (I don&#39;t feel like this is a good idea but I kind of liked the idea of having everything in a single place).  Using vcpkg I installed the 2 libraries I&#39;d wish to use: allegro and sqlite3.  Both installations went fine and I&#39;m actually quite surprised by vcpkg itself.\r\n\r\nI setup my project structure: since this will be a modular project I started creating a bunch of shared libraries in CMake via the `add_library(lib_name SHARED sources)` function and I ended up having a structure similar to the following one:\r\n```\r\nproject_root/CMakeLists.txt\r\nproject_root/src/main.cpp\r\n\r\nproject_root/core\r\nproject_root/core/CMakeLists.txt\r\nproject_root/core/include/core/bunch_of_headers.hpp\r\nproject_root/core/src/bunch_of_sources.cpp\r\n\r\nproject_root/model\r\nproject_root/model/CMakeLists.txt\r\nproject_root/model/include/model/bunch_of_headers.hpp\r\nproject_root/model/src/bunch_of_sources.cpp\r\n```\r\n\r\nand so on..\r\n\r\nEvery folder within the `project_root` contains a module, and all the CMakeLists file look like the following one:\r\n```cmake\r\nadd_library(model SHARED all_the_source_files.cpp)\r\n\r\ninclude(DeclareNewSharedLibrary)\r\ndeclare_new_shared_library(model)\r\n\r\nfind_package(sqlite3 CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(model sqlite3)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `declare_new_shared_library()` is defined as the following function in a separate cmake module\r\n```cmake\r\nfunction(declare_new_shared_library lib_name)\r\n\tmessage(STATUS &quot;Declaring new library ${lib_name}&quot;)\r\n\tinclude(GenerateExportHeader)\r\n\tgenerate_export_header(${lib_name})\r\n\r\n\ttarget_include_directories(${lib_name}\r\n\t\tPUBLIC &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include&quot;\r\n\t\tPUBLIC &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}&quot;\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\tset_target_properties(${lib_name} PROPERTIES\r\n\t\tIMPORTED_IMPLIB &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${lib_name}.lib&quot;\r\n\t\tIMPORTED_LOCATION &quot;${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${lib_name}.dll&quot;\r\n\t)\r\nendfunction(declare_new_shared_library)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing fancy so far.\r\n\r\nNow, every module compiles fine, even when I link the shared library against a library which has been downloaded through vcpkg (as it happens in the example above). The `ld` on Windows correctly outputs the needed files (`.lib` and `.dll`) and copies them in the `${CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY}` as expected.\r\n\r\nThe issue I&#39;m having here, is that there is **one** library which doesn&#39;t compile. The CMake file is identical to the other ones, except that I&#39;m linking against the allegro library (which has been installed via vcpkg like all the others). Here&#39;s the CMake file for comparison:\r\n```\r\nadd_library(core SHARED all_the_sources.cpp)\r\n\r\ninclude(DeclareNewSharedLibrary)\r\ndeclare_new_shared_library(core)\r\n\r\nfind_package(allegro CONFIG REQUIRED)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(core allegro)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to compile this target (either directly or via the dependencies system) I get the following error\r\n\r\nTL;DR:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Dev\\ConsultantLife\\msvcrtd.lib(exe_main.obj) : error LNK2019: unresolved external symbol main referenced in function &quot;int __cdecl invoke_main(void)&quot;

I have to admit I&#39;ve never used CMake for professional projects (we&#39;re a bunch of oldies still using GNU Autotools&amp;Co.) so I might have missed something.

Queries on this view are too slow - usually 100-500ms but can spike to 3000-7000ms.\r\n\r\nWe can&#39;t add the missing columns to the main table. We are doing some ETL, the missing columns are in many other tables, it is just a non-starter.\r\n\r\nMaterialized views was the first attempt. This was effective on query speed but updating the view was unacceptably slow. We need as little latency as possible, ideally under 1 minute, but updates were taking 5-20 minutes.\r\n\r\nPartitioning is another idea. Updates and reads occur on a smaller section of the data. We join smaller tables into views and, whilst performance isn&#39;t ideal, it is far better. I have never used partitions though, and would appreciate an opinion on the complexity they would add.\r\n\r\nI also looked at different hardware. Obviously, this would help to some degree but it feels like this isn&#39;t a total solution.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be appreciated. Obviously, there are a few things online but what I would really appreciate is an opinion from someone who has a slightly deeper knowledge than myself, and understands the trade-offs.\r\n\r\nOne big priority here, as I have said a few times, is complexity.

This is highly unusual, and I suspect you misunderstood how your &#39;axois&#39; library works, however.. throwing the &#39;response&#39; (weird as it is) makes it consistent with your original post.\r\n\r\nThis sample can be further simplified with async/await. You used the async keyword (incorrectly) in your example, so I assume that you&#39;re able to use this:\r\n\r\n    public getSomething(userId: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {\r\n    \r\n      try {\r\n        const response = await this.axios().get(baseUrl + path, config);\r\n        if (response &amp;&amp; response.data &amp;&amp; response.status === 200) {\r\n           return response.data;\r\n        } else {\r\n           throw response;\r\n        }\r\n      } catch (response) {\r\n        logger.error(response);\r\n        const status = response.response ? response.response.status : 500;\r\n        throw this.buildError(status, userId);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain we are throwing the response, which is very strange...\r\n\r\nDigging a bit into your Axios library, it appears that by default Axios will throw an error with a &#39;response&#39; property when a HTTP erro occurred. If this is correct, your code sample should actually look like this:\r\n\r\n    public getSomething(userId: string): Promise&lt;any&gt; {\r\n    \r\n      try {\r\n        const response = await this.axios().get(baseUrl + path, config);\r\n        return response.data;\r\n      } catch (err) {\r\n        logger.error(err);\r\n        const status = err.response ? err.response.status : 500;\r\n        throw this.buildError(status, userId);\r\n      }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085780/how-do-you-return-a-typed-promise/58089861#58089861","title":"How do you return a typed Promise"}],"owner":{"reputation":1685,"user_id":1575416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32e1e3caa938438115454a4688a3d4a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aggaton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1575416/aggaton"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1685,"user_id":1575416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32e1e3caa938438115454a4688a3d4a2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"aggaton","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1575416/aggaton"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569373677,"creation_date":1569347579,"last_edit_date":1569348235,"question_id":58085780,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58085780","body_markdown":"Below code works, however it promises to return any thing.

Does value always appear before client? Does it always appear after the time and date?\r\n\r\nAnyway - [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32680030/match-text-between-two-strings-with-regular-expression), or [Quicksilver&#39;s](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11063448/quicksilver) answer should work if value does always appear after date and time and before client.  \r\n\r\nHowever, you might also just want to search for whatever appears after `value=` and before ` ,`, in which case this should work: https://regex101.com/r/a4d7Bx/1\r\n``` python\r\nimport re\r\n\r\ntext = &#39;isLogIn=true; Max-Age=400; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:46:30 GMT, value=qasde% , client=retail&#39;\r\n\r\nm = re.search(&#39;value=(.+?) ,&#39;, text)\r\nif m:\r\n    found = m.group(1)\r\n    print(found)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother way to do this by slightly editing your code:\r\n``` python\r\ntext = &#39;isLogIn=true; Max-Age=400; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:46:30 GMT, value=qasde% , client=retail&#39;\r\n\r\ntext = text.split(&#39;value=&#39;, 1)[1]\r\ntext = text.split(&#39; , client&#39;,1)[0]\r\nprint(text)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou asked for the simpler way. Arguably, both of these methods are pretty simple, so I&#39;d opt for the faster one (unless you want the more general solution, in which case use the first option). I timed them using the following code:\r\n``` python\r\nimport re\r\nimport cProfile\r\n\r\ntext = &#39;isLogIn=true; Max-Age=400; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:46:30 GMT, value=qasde% , client=retail&#39;\r\n\r\ndef option1(text):\r\n  for i in range(10000):\r\n    re.search(&#39;value=(.+?) ,&#39;, text)\r\n\r\ndef option2(text):\r\n  for i in range(10000):\r\n    temp = text.split(&#39;value=&#39;, 1)[1]\r\n    temp = temp.split(&#39; , client&#39;,1)[0]\r\n\r\ncProfile.run(&quot;option1(text)&quot;)\r\nprint(&quot;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n&quot;)\r\ncProfile.run(&quot;option2(text)&quot;)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the first option took 0.076 seconds while the second took 0.027 seconds, so the faster option is using `split`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58085768/python-regex-extract-a-string-between-two-strings/58085914#58085914","title":"Python regex extract a string between two strings"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":19470,"user_id":6553328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9vHq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Emma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553328/emma"},"last_editor":{"reputation":19470,"user_id":6553328,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/p9vHq.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Emma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553328/emma"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569348978,"last_edit_date":1569348978,"creation_date":1569348672,"answer_id":58086013,"question_id":58085768,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58086013","body_markdown":"This expression might simply return that:\r\n\r\n    import re\r\n    \r\n    expression = r&#39;(?:value|client)\\s*=\\s*([^,\\r\\n]*?)(?=\\s*,|$)&#39;\r\n    \r\n    string = &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    isLogIn=true; Max-Age=400; Path=/; Expires=Wed, 25 Sep 2019 17:46:30 GMT, value=qasde% , client=retail\r\n    \r\n    &quot;&quot;&quot;\r\n    \r\n    print(re.findall(expression, string, re.M))\r\n\r\n###Output\r\n\r\n    [&#39;qasde%&#39;, &#39;retail&#39;]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIf you wish to simplify/modify/explore the expression, it&#39;s been explained on the top right panel of [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/r/sbJqkV/1/).

Unfortunately, the `DataGridView` does not have this property. I am guessing a third-party library may have a grid with this feature.\r\n\r\nBelow is a possible solution taken from an answer by @Cody Gray. [DataGridView keydown event not working in C#](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284370/datagridview-keydown-event-not-working-in-c-sharp)... His answer touches on the problem when trying to wire-up the grids `KeyDown` or other “Key” events that are for the “GRID.” Meaning that when the user is “editing” in a cell, those events will not fire. In most cases, you should use the grids `EditingControlShowing` event to capture the individual cell key events. This appears simple enough; however, it is unclear “when” this should be done.\r\n\r\nExample, using either solution below will work as described by moving the selection horizontally and not vertically when the user presses the enter key… HOWEVER…. this ONLY works IF the user is “editing” a cell when the “Enter” key is pressed. If the user simply “clicks” on a different cell then presses the “Enter” key the selection will move down.\r\n\r\nI am confident that you could get this to work for the cases when the cell is NOT being edited. The question I would ask… Is it worth the effort to turn the “Enter” key into a “Tab” key? If you were to implement this beyond the cell being edited, I am confident that you will realize after you implement this that the functionality you just implemented is already available in the “Tab” key. Just a thought on reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\nAs Cody’s answer alludes to, it is not straight forward to do what you are describing using the “DataGridView” base events. This solution basically creates a Class that inherits from the `DataGridView` and overrides the grids `ProcessCmdKey` event. Here you can implement the behavior described, however, as stated above, the horizontal movement will only happen if the cell is being edited.\r\n\r\n    class MyDataGridView : DataGridView {\r\n\r\n      protected override bool ProcessCmdKey(ref System.Windows.Forms.Message msg, System.Windows.Forms.Keys keyData) {\r\n        if ((keyData == (Keys.Enter))) {\r\n          if (this.CurrentCell.IsInEditMode) {\r\n            Point lastPosition = new Point(this.CurrentCell.ColumnIndex, this.CurrentCell.RowIndex);\r\n            if (lastPosition.X == this.ColumnCount - 1) {\r\n              lastPosition.X = 0;\r\n              lastPosition.Y++;\r\n            }\r\n            else {\r\n              lastPosition.X++;\r\n            }\r\n            this.CurrentCell = this.Rows[lastPosition.Y].Cells[lastPosition.X];\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        return base.ProcessCmdKey(ref msg, keyData);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n@Asaf ‘s answer in the same link above, supplied an example using the grids base events. A full example is below using both approaches. Drop a `DataGridView` and a `myDataGridView` onto a form for the code to work properly.
