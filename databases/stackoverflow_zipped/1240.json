Without a known fixed dimension dots per inch is meaningless. \r\n\r\nYou can print a 240 by 240 canvas at 240dpi by printing it to be 1 by 1inch in size. That very same canvas will also be 24dpi if you print it to be 10 by 10 inches.\r\n\r\nIf you want the the pixel density of the canvas to match some DPI you need to set the canvas resolution to match a known print size, and when you print the canvas you must specify that size or the DPI will not match.\r\n\r\n##Example. Set canvas resolution to match known print size and dpi\r\n\r\nTo print a canvas to fit an A4 page at 240dpi\r\n\r\n    const A4_PAGE_SIZE = {width: 8.27, height: 11.69); // in inches\r\n    const DPI = 240;  \r\n    canvas.width = A4_PAGE_SIZE.width * DPI;   // ~1984px\r\n    canvas.height = A4_PAGE_SIZE.height * DPI; // ~2805px\r\n\r\nNow render the canvas content to fit the new canvas resolution, and convert to PNG. You can then print the image at 240 dpi by setting the print size to be 8.27 by 11.69 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note** If you are not rendering the canvas content (eg the content is a loaded image) then you should match the canvas size to the image size, making the canvas resolution higher (or lower) than the original image will decrease the print quality as the scaling used by the canvas 2D API is not designed for print.\r\n\r\n**Note** The PNG image format does let you specify the physical size of the PNG image by setting pixels per meter rather than the total pixels in the header. However you can not do this via the native canvas API. You will need to use a 3rd party PNG encoder to set this header info.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247506/alter-resolution-of-an-image-to-match-a-certain-pixel-density-dpi/58250491#58250491","title":"Alter resolution of an image to match a certain pixel density (DPI)"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12168298,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cmNs025-glA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rerymfsy9I315PLYAFghNlL7q-I7Q/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"kaalanama kaal","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12168298/kaalanama-kaal"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570294701,"creation_date":1570271900,"question_id":58247506,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58247506","body_markdown":"I am working on a HTML5 canvas where I am manipulating certain graphics and text using javascript.

include the Google Maps API twice, once in Show.html.erb which will be loaded inside the Application.html.erb I believe and there again you yield the JavaScript Google Maps API a second time. The error states that it is on line 140 that it is included a second time and that is the one with the initMap so inside Show.html.erb which is probably included inside an index and/or Application.html.erb so I suggest looking at the page source to get a complete HTML view of the final loaded page and there on line 140 you probably will see the second inclusion\n\nSecondly if a function isn&#39;t declared yet you MUST not call it so now you call I initMap but that function doesn&#39;t exist. So start with removing the script include inside Show.html.erb or remove the yield in Application.html.erb and also remove the initMap call until the map works as supposed then go on to initMap declaration.\n\nJS will stop loading or working if there is a severe error so having both included the API twice and calling a non existing function will get you I to trouble.\n\nDo make sure that the API is loaded before the map is used or the API is called and since JS is non blocking sync wait until ready state of the document before doing anything.\n\nEdit: are you also sure that on refresh that it is not maintaining the Google Maps API include?

As in Procedure Signature there is NO OUTPUT type defined, so that result is obtained in Result Set.\r\n\r\nCode for Execution is :\r\n\r\n\t\t\tResultSet rs = null;\r\n\t\t\trs = calbleStmt.executeQuery();\r\n\t\t\tif (rs != null) {\r\n\t\t\t\twhile (rs.next()) {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tList list = new

Result from this will be in format :\r\n\r\n       COL1          COL2        COL3         COL4         Col5\r\n        1             2           3             4            5\r\n        10

way.\r\n\r\nFor Example in 1 Project I have \r\n\r\n    Vector vec = new Vector();\r\n    Properties prop = new Properties();\r\n    while (rs.next()) {\r\n    prop.setProperty(&quot;1&quot;,rs.getString(1));\r\n    prop.setProperty(&quot;2&quot;,rs.getString(2));\r\n    prop.setProperty(&quot;N&quot;,rs.getString(N));\r\n    vec.add(prop);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut in the above project, properties need to be set as per number of fetched column.\r\n\r\nFor example, currently procedure returns 5 columns with two rows, but it may be possible that any other procedure return N number of rows and columns.\r\n\r\nI am working in Java Version

version: it is a bug in ansible, caused by the presence of empty .yml files in `vars/main`. There is a PR out for it already. See \r\n[here][1] . \r\n\r\nThe actual result (as mentioned in the comments) actually depends on the order the files are processed (by default, it looks like my Ansible processes them in alphabetical order - but this might depend on the version, or the underlying OS):\r\n\r\n - If the empty file is processed first, you get an error message: `ERROR! failed to combine variables, expected dicts but got a &#39;NoneType&#39; and a &#39;AnsibleMapping&#39;`\r\n - If the empty file is processed after other files, there is no error message, but all the variables that have been set up to this point are destroyed\r\n\r\nMore details: since I have no idea how to troubleshoot this in Ansible itself, I went to the code and started to add `print` statements to see what is happening.\r\n\r\nIn my case, I had some empty .yml files in the `vars/main` directory (files that I was planning to populate later on. Well... it looks like when the code encounters such an empty file, it destroys the entire dictionary that it has built so far.\r\n\r\nEither I&#39;m missing something very important, or this is a bug... Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n - create a role\r\n - create the `vars/main` directory, and populate it with some .yml files\r\n - add an empty .yml file (named so that it is processed after the other files)\r\n - try to print the variables from the first files\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ansible# tree roles \r\n    roles\r\n    +-- test\r\n        +-- tasks\r\n        &#166;&#160;&#160; +-- main.yml\r\n        +-- vars\r\n            +-- main\r\n                +-- correct_vars.yml\r\n    \r\n    4 directories, 2 files\r\n    \r\n    ansible# cat roles/test/vars/main/correct_vars.yml  myname: bogd\r\n    \r\n    ansible# ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml test.yml \r\n    ... \r\n    ok: [localhost] =&gt; {\r\n        &quot;myname&quot;: &quot;bogd&quot; } \r\n    ...\r\n    \r\n    ansible# echo &gt; roles/test/vars/main/emptyfile.yml\r\n    \r\n    ansible# ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml test.yml \r\n    ... ok: [localhost] =&gt; {\r\n        &quot;myname&quot;: &quot;VARIABLE IS NOT DEFINED!&quot; } \r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater edit: yep, it&#39;s a bug...

I used Firebase messaging to notify the app for incoming calls. Upon receiving an incoming call notification, the app starts a calling activity, that alerts the user for the incoming call. Using this activity, the user can either answer or reject the call. The app was working fine prior to Android 10. After Android 10 and the restrictions introduced with it, particularly the one that prevents apps in the background from starting activities, my app stopped working properly. This happened because I start the calling activity from the background which is not supported anymore.

state object should look like this\r\n\r\n    state = {\r\n    section_to_show: {\r\n      One,\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIf you are still having some problem i have created a [Sandbox][1] for you convenience \r\n\r\none other thing if your array have small letters like you have [&#39;one&#39;] you can easily map it to an object but i hope that&#39;s not too difficult\r\n\r\nHope it helps\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

one of them must have the effect that, whenever it fulfils, it should alter the processing of other fulfilled promises that have not yet been processed or are not yet being processed.\r\n\r\nDo you run them all together? Something like:\r\n\r\n    promise1 = asyncFunc1()\r\n    promise2 = asyncFunc2()\r\n    promise3 = asyncFunc3()\r\n\r\n    Promise.all([promise1, promise2, promise3]).then(//sometthing)\r\n\r\nIf yes, it can&#39;t be done, unless the promise2 function and promise3 function aren&#39;t waiting for an event, a lock, or something handled by the promise1 function.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case is better to organize the promises like:\r\n\r\n    asyncFunc1()\r\n        .then(() =&gt; asyncFunc2(paramIfOk))\r\n        .catch(() =&gt; asyncFunc2(paramIfFail))\r\n\r\nIn your example:\r\n\r\n    const allItemsToBeDelivered = [myPromise1(), myPromise2(), ...]\r\n\r\nmyPromise1() code should wait for the item to be delivered **and** check if someone is waiting for it. It&#39;s a model/code design problem, not a promise one.\r\n\r\nAnother way to do it is consider some event driven logic: an entity Customer has a listener for the delivered event that will be fired by the waitItemDelivered() promise just before resolve itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: as requested here a little more elaboration on the event-driven solution.\r\n\r\nShort answer: it highly depend on your software design.\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s already something released and running in production? Be carefull with changes like this. If it&#39;s a service that you are developing you&#39;re still in time to take in consideration some logic changes. A solution that doesn&#39;t change radically how is working but use an events is not that great, mixing patterns never pay off on long term.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n\tconst events = require(&#39;events&#39;);\r\n\r\n\tclass Customer() {\r\n\r\n\t\tconstructor(shop) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.emitter = new events.EventEmitter()\r\n\r\n\t\t\tthis.shopEventListener = shop.emitter\r\n\t\t\tthis.setupEventLinstening() // for keeping things clean in the constructor\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// other properties here\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tsetupEventLinstening() {\r\n\t\t\tthis.shopEventListener.on(&#39;product-delivered&#39;, (eventData) =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\t// some logic\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\tbuyProduct() {\r\n\t\t\t// some logic\r\n\r\n\t\t\tthis.emitter.emit(&#39;waiting-delivery&#39;, eventData)\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tclass Shop() {\r\n\r\n\t\tconstructor(shop) {\r\n\t\t\tthis.emitter = new events.EventEmitter()\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// other properties here\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\taddCustomer(customer) {\r\n\t\t\tcustomer.emitter.on(&#39;waiting-delivery&#39;, (eventData) =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\t// some logic\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tself.waitDelivery().then(() =&gt; self.emitter.emit(&#39;product-delivered&#39;))\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\r\n\t\twaitDelivery() {\r\n\t\t\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\t// some logic\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tresolve()\r\n\t\t\t})\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t// setup\r\n\tconst shop = new Shop()\r\n\tconst customer = new Customer(shop)\r\n\tshop.addCustomer(customer)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a new way of seeing the logic, but a similar approach can be used inside a promise:\r\n\r\n\tconst waitDelivery = () =&gt; new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tlogisticWaitDelivery().then(() =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tsomeEmitter.emit(&#39;item-delivered&#39;)\r\n\t\t\tresolve()\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tconst customerPromise = () =&gt; new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tsomeListener.on(&#39;item-delivered&#39;, () =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\tresolve()\r\n\t\t})\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpromiseAll([waitDelivery,

code needs to perform a multitude of async actions simultaneously and handle their promises in a specific sequential way.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean by &quot;specific sequential way&quot; ==&gt; Assume you are starting promises `promise1`, `promise2`, `promise3` in that order, and that promise3 actually resolves first, and promise2 second, then what I want is to process `promise3`, `promise2` and `promise1` sequentially in that order\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s consider a `timeout` async function that times out after X seconds, and `fetchMyItem1`, `fetchMyItem2`, that return promises which, when fulfilled, should execute a different code depending whether `timeout` has resolved or not.\r\n\r\nFor a concrete scenario, imagine there is a customer waiting at the counter for an item to be delivered, and either the customer stays and we can serve him directly at the counter by bringing one item at a time, or the customer goes away (`timeout`) and we have to ask a waiter to come so that when the items arrive, he/she can bring the items to him. Note here that even when one item is being delivered, the other items should still be undergoing delivery (the promises are pending), and might even arrive (be fulfilled) while the customer is being served one item or the server arrives.\r\n\r\nHere is some code to start with\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst allItemsToBeDeliveredPromises = [fetchMyItem1(), fetchMyItem2(), ...]\r\nconst customerLeavesCounterPromise = timeout()\r\n\r\nconst waiter = undefined\r\n\r\nconst allPromisesToBeFulfilled = [...allItemsToBeDeliveredPromises, customerLeavesCounterPromise]\r\n\r\n// LOOP\r\nconst itemDeliveredOrVisitorLeft = await Promise.all(allPromisesToBeFulfilled)\r\n\r\nif hasCustomerLeft(itemDeliveredOrCustomerLeft) {\r\n  // hasCustomerLeft allows us to detect if the promise that resolved first is `customerLeavesCounterPromise` or not\r\n  waiter = await callWaiter()\r\n} else {\r\n  // An item has arrived\r\n  if (waiter) {\r\n    deliverItemViaWaiter(itemDeliveredOrVisitorLeft)\r\n  } else {\r\n    deliverItemAtCounter(itemDeliveredOrVisitorLeft)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n// remove itemDeliveredOrCustomerLeft from allPromisesToBeFulfilled\r\n\r\n// END loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to implement a loop for this scenario. Promises must be accumulated into a queue as they resolve, but there is a priority for a specific promise in the queue (the timeout promise should be executed asap when it arrives, but after finishing the processing of the current promise if a promise fulfilment is already being processed)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247385/promise-callback-queue-with-priority-for-some-callbacks","title":"Promise callback queue with priority for some

When a signal is triggered, the appropriate method on the controller is called. The controller method, in turn, calls a method on the model and/or changes another UI element.\r\n\r\nThe above example presents a one-to-one association between view, controller, and model, but you can vary this according to your requirements.\r\n\r\nThere are other modern derivatives of MVC (e.g. MVVM and MVP), but I prefer it because of its simplicity and also because the other patterns are more effective when the framework in use supports them.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247357/qt5-pyqt5-best-practices/58249512#58249512","title":"Qt5/PyQt5 best practices"}],"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":1714490,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPfJX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZioByte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1714490/ziobyte"},"last_editor":{"reputation":923,"user_id":1714490,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/DPfJX.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ZioByte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1714490/ziobyte"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":1,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":70,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"closed_date":1570293467,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570307677,"creation_date":1570270537,"last_edit_date":1570307677,"question_id":58247357,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58247357","body_markdown":"Rewritten to clarify as requested.\r\n-\r\nDisclaimer:\r\n-\r\nI am a relative newbie to Qt programming and, to date, I have written only small complexity applications, usually following closely provided examples.\r\n\r\nNow I&#39;ve been asked to (re)write a configuration GUI for an existing product (a cash register, if it matters) based on an embedded Linux which contains a large, possibly expanding, set of &quot;configuration pages&quot;. A few examples:\r\n\r\n- Software update; allowing to selectively update system and/or application.\r\n- Network setup; allowing Wired and WiFi configuration.\r\n- Internal database update (products, prices, ...)\r\n- Maintenance: view internal logs, memory cleanups, ...\r\n- Export: trigger and configure reports on daily/monthly/yearly activity.\r\n- etc.\r\n\r\nI started designing the interface in Qt Designer I quickly realized I was about to get a pretty huge mass of spaghetti-code if I simply tried to make a &quot;bigger version&quot; of what I previously had done.\r\n\r\nFrom this stems the original, very general, question:\r\n\r\n*In a complex interface with nested containers (QToolBox, QTabWidget, ...) what is the &quot;approved way&quot; (if any) to partition slots so not to have zillions of them in &quot;MainWindow&quot;?*\r\n\r\n*Any pointer to &quot;best practices&quot; for non-trivial examples would be welcome.*\r\n\r\nStatus:\r\n-\r\nI&#39;m currently in design/prototyping stage and I can change things quite easily; later changes might be less handy, of course.\r\n\r\nMy current design is quite standard:\r\n\r\n- a monolithic GUI interface built with Qt Designer with a top-level QToolBox Widget to chose the &quot;page&quot; to edit and individual pages tailored to the specific configuration needs\r\n- import into pyqt5 using the standard paradigm:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    class MWindow(QMainWindow):\r\n        def __init__(self):\r\n            super(MWindow, self).__init__()\r\n            uic.loadUi(&#39;app.ui&#39;, self)\r\n               \r\n        ...\r\n    \r\n    app = QApplication(sys.argv)\r\n    mw = MWindow()\r\n    mw.show()\r\n    sys.exit(app.exec_())\r\n```\r\n- have a backend talking with target and providing &quot;commands&quot; to actually perform required actions (I cannot have a proper MVC because &#39;M&#39; is elsewhere and &#39;C&#39; is split, partly on configurator, partly on target).\r\n\r\nI quickly discovered I can have tens of slots handled for each single &quot;page&quot; if I want to do proper input validation and be &quot;user friendly&quot; (e.g.: to automatically generate netmask/broadcast from edited IP address, not to speak of the ample code duplication between Ethernet configuration and WiFi Configuration). That is not currently required, but I *know* request will come later on and I want to plan ahead.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\n-\r\nIn other contexts I would have tried to make all UI-related processing more local; e.g.:\r\n\r\n- write a class/page to handle IP addresses\r\n- subclass it to add what&#39;s required for WiFi.\r\n- build a tabbed widget with a tab for each connection actually available on target, instantiating one of the above classes as needed.\r\n- put the tabbed widget into one of the toolbox pages.\r\n- rinse and repeat.\r\n\r\nOTOH some real-life examples (see: [Wireshark&#39;s MainWindow](https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/blob/master/ui/qt/main_window.h#L297-L685)) seem to go in the opposite &quot;everything in a single basket&quot; direction.\r\n\r\nIs there any, reasonably consolidated, best-practice recommendation to handle this kind of situation?\r\n\r\nMore to the point: If I insist in splitting code to have a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; approach, how would that translate into QtDesigner/code relationships? (I definitely don&#39;t want to resort to hand-code GUI).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247357/qt5-pyqt5-best-practices","closed_reason":"unclear what you&#39;re asking","title":"Qt5/PyQt5 best practices"},{"tags":["laravel-5","yajra-datatable"],"owner":{"reputation":102,"user_id":3613255,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":42,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1ed52a0aa03b4eb12cdd02f1ed0ea49?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jim","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3613255/jim"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570270531,"creation_date":1570270531,"question_id":58247356,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58247356","body_markdown":"I am trying to filter out data and present it in a table.

However, if I set the `LinearLayoutManager` to be horizontal it only renders what&#39;s on screen, and not the entire width even though the `RecyclerView` width is set to to `wrap_content`! It also isn&#39;t triggered to pull up new items on horizontal scroll (I suppose because scrolling is handled by the  `ScrollView`). \r\n\r\nIs this a bug in the `RecyclerView` library? Or does it happen because `HorizontalScrollView` doesn&#39;t play nice with a nested `RecyclerView` like the (vertical) `NestedScrollView` does?

the pattern space\r\n  includes the line separator(s) in order to enable succesive splitting.\r\n- If the pattern space contains a comma, then print the left hand\r\n  and update the pattern space with the right hand.\r\n- If the pattern space contains the word &quot; and &quot;, the processing is a bit\r\n  difficult because the word remains in the updated pattern space.\r\n  My approach may not be elegant in a sense but it works even if a record\r\n  contains multiple (two or more) &quot; and &quot;s.\r\n\r\n**[EDIT]**\r\n\r\nIf you want to include the word `and` as a part of the word count, please replace the 2nd line:\r\n\r\n    while (split($0, a, &quot;( +and +)|( +)&quot;) &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; match($0, &quot;( +and +)|,&quot;)) {\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n    while (NF &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; match($0, &quot;( +and +)|,&quot;)) {\r\n\r\nIn addition, if you allow the word `and` to follow the\r\noriginal line: the script will be a bit simplified as:\r\n\r\n    awk &#39;{\r\n        while (NF &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; match($0, &quot;( +and +)|,&quot;)) {\r\n            if (match($0, &quot;[^,]+,&quot;)) {\r\n                # puts a newline after the 1st comma\r\n                print substr($0, 1, RLENGTH)\r\n                $0 = substr($0, RLENGTH + 1)\r\n            } else {\r\n                # puts a newline after the 1st substring &quot;

(Location tracking).\r\nSo the problem is when ever I close the app, and run the app again (After exiting it once).\r\nThe instance of the activities remain there. as the app was not closed from the foreground due to the background service.\r\n\r\nAnd this creates a problem with expo image picker, as for the first time, its working fine. But when i open the second time. the image picker doesn&#39;t return anything. I tried everything and everything works fine when my service is not running, but it is, my react native app activity instances remain there even after app restarts, so my image picker is not working somehow.\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know what to do next, I also tried few `android launch modes` but can&#39;t figure out anything.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst imageFromCamera = await ExpoImagePicker.launchCameraAsync({\r\n          mediaTypes: ExpoImagePicker.MediaTypeOptions.Images,\r\n          allowsEditing: true\r\n        });\r\n        console.log(imageFromCamera);\r\n```\r\nhere, the imageFromCamera log never fires when background service is running. It only works for the first time.\r\n\r\nMy guess is because my service doesn&#39;t kill the instances, and when i run the app again. everything works and my image picker somehow loses the track of the instance. (Its my guess).\r\nI don&#39;t know how to resolve this.\r\n\r\nHelp would be appreciated. \r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247321/react-native-expo-image-picker-wont-return-anything-android-android-launch-m","title":"React Native: Expo image picker won&#39;t return anything (ANDROID) android launch mode problem maybe"},{"tags":["css"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":107371,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570270487,"post_id":58247316,"comment_id":102865685,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247316/keep-100vh-height-inside-parent-with-overflow#comment102865685_58247316"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6322,"user_id":3289660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGFex.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nidhin Joseph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3289660/nidhin-joseph"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570270568,"creation_date":1570270568,"answer_id":58247362,"question_id":58247316,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58247362","body_markdown":"\r\nInstead of height, add `max-height: 100vh;` to the `.parent`\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    .parent {\r\n      background: green;\r\n      overflow-y: auto;\r\n      overflow-x: hidden;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      top: 0;\r\n      left: 0;\r\n      width: 300px;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      max-height: 100vh;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    .child {\r\n      background: blue;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;parent&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;child&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n        &lt;p&gt; line&lt;/p&gt;\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247316/keep-100vh-height-inside-parent-with-overflow/58247362#58247362","title":"keep 100vh height inside parent with overflow"}],"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":1031742,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8830b3629bc17f02e4ba9c8dd06b30ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1031742","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1031742/user1031742"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6322,"user_id":3289660,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/cGFex.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nidhin Joseph","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3289660/nidhin-joseph"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58247362,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570270624,"creation_date":1570270234,"last_edit_date":1570270624,"question_id":58247316,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58247316","body_markdown":"I have a parent div with overflow.

It should be fairly straightforward to do this with Keras.\r\n\r\n## I need a way to convert the text into a numerical format. There seems to be a few options out there like word2vec, but I am not sure what is the best option.\r\n\r\nYes, word vectors would definitely improve performance of your model. But if you want a more naive solution, you can try [onehot vectors](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-one-hot-encode-sequence-data-in-python/). I would recommend starting with onehot vectors and then once you have a working solution, improve that using word vectors. This way you are certain that you&#39;re not introducing too much complexity at the beginning, making it easier to debug if something goes wrong in the implementation).\r\n\r\nPS: word2vec is quite old now, there are better alternatives such as [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and [FastText](https://fasttext.cc/).\r\n\r\n## How many neurons should my base layer have? (With number recognition each image is 28*28 so a 28*28 base layer makes a lot of sense, here I am not sure)\r\n\r\nThis depends on the size of your vocabulary. As I said earlier, regardless of whether you&#39;re using word vectors or not, you will have to transform words to onehot vectors. And the length of a onehot vector is determined by the size of the vocabulary.\r\n\r\n## How many hidden layers?\r\n\r\nThis is a very difficult question to answer. You will need to try different architectures and find the optimal one if you&#39;re looking for the optimal structure (i.e. by means of hyperparameter optimization).\r\n\r\n## How many output layers? \r\n\r\nThink this is a tricky one (mainly because tag prediction is not in my area of expertise). But I can tell you two things to try.\r\n\r\n1. Have an output layer with all possible categories. But as you can imagine, someone needs to come up with the categories. And then if you have a large set of tags you will end up with a large softmax prediction layer. But you can alleviate that using something like negative sampling.\r\n\r\n2. You can do this with just one output layer with a fixed vocabulary (e.g. electronics, phone, laptop, etc.). However you will need to have a fixed set of tags (i.e. vocabulary) you want to predict from. Then you can use an [LSTM](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/) model to predict an arbitrary number of tags for a given description. You can produce an arbitrary number of tags as outputs because you can keep predicting one time step at a time, using an LSTM model. \r\n\r\nBut now you&#39;re assuming time dependency between tags (in the order they come) which can lead to funny results. For example if you have the same description but two different series of tags (i.e. electronics, phone, samsung and electronics, samsung, phone) this can confuse the model.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247292/how-can-one-train-a-neural-network-to-classify-text-into-preexisting-classificat/58248078#58248078","title":"How can one train a neural network to classify text into preexisting classifications?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12168024,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6909ddbfadc486c8249a94193157aece?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Krafty1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12168024/krafty1"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570281264,"creation_date":1570270077,"question_id":58247292,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58247292","body_markdown":"I have a dataset that looks a bit like the following think a shop like walmart.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----+\r\n|                     Description                     | Classification 1 | Classification 2 | Classification 3 | ... |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----+\r\n| iphone 7 order# :123595                             | Electronic       | Cell Phone       | Apple            |     |\r\n| purchase of samsung galaxy s10 reference 32-2345    | Electronic       | Cell Phone       | Samsung          |     |\r\n| dell 13&quot; 500gb ssd intel i7                         | Electronic       | Laptop           | Dell             |     |\r\n| tablet 15cm for chris t price $199.76               | Electronic       | Tablet           | NULL             |     |\r\n| ...                                                 | ...              | ...              | ...              |     |\r\n| 50x rolley chairs for office supplied by home depot | Supplies         | Furniture        | Chairs           |     |\r\n| electrician cost for new building                   | Supplies         | Electrical       | Work             |     |\r\n+-----------------------------------------------------+------------------+------------------+------------------+-----+\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis shape of the dataset is quite large with several thousand (maybe &gt;100,000) rows and maybe 50+ columns.\r\n\r\nI am wanting to a method in order correctly classify the row based on its description.\r\n\r\nSo a model based on the above dataset should take a description it has not seen before and correctly classify that item for instance:\r\n`iphone 11 $999.99 =&gt; Electronic, Cell Phone, Apple`.\r\n\r\nI am currently only planning on using the description to classify as a first step to keep it simple, however there are other columns such as who supplied the item that could help classify, for instance if the item was supplied by `Apple` or `AT&amp;T` it is more likely to be classified as a `Cell Phone` for example.\r\n\r\nI am thinking to implement a neural network to do this. I have implemented neural network before but only on the typical examples (e.g. a system to identify the numbers 0-9 [MINST dataset] or to identify clothes), so I understand the theory of how neural networks work (weights, biases, gradient descent, back propagation etc.) However I am struggling on how to implement this idea I have now.\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts so far:\r\n\r\n&gt; 1. I want to use Python, with tensorflow2.0 + keras.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; 2. I need a way to convert the text into a numerical format.

Instead I am looking for guidance/suggestions on how to proceed with this problem from someone who is more experienced, perhaps, in fact, most likely there are things I am not considering yet.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247292/how-can-one-train-a-neural-network-to-classify-text-into-preexisting-classificat","title":"How can one train a neural network to classify text into preexisting classifications?"},{"tags":["mysql","sql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":7813221,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/18Ub6.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Feacio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7813221/feacio"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570272349,"post_id":58247289,"comment_id":102866088,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247289/return-all-possible-combinations-of-values-within-a-single-column-in-mysql#comment102866088_58247289"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3997,"user_id":608170,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":90,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rwz4m.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"verisimilitude","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/608170/verisimilitude"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570272611,"post_id":58247552,"comment_id":102866137,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247289/return-all-possible-combinations-of-values-within-a-single-column-in-mysql/58247552#comment102866137_58247552"},{"owner":{"reputation":85,"user_id":1905466,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bb80cc78f0270f7af4cd67dab58d7714?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"husnul","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1905466/husnul"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570273083,"post_id":58247552,"comment_id":102866225,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247289/return-all-possible-combinations-of-values-within-a-single-column-in-mysql/58247552#comment102866225_58247552"},{"owner":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":1052130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3baa0e98e2ab917b174073a7e8b6c13b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"slaakso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1052130/slaakso"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570273358,"post_id":58247552,"comment_id":102866283,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247289/return-all-possible-combinations-of-values-within-a-single-column-in-mysql/58247552#comment102866283_58247552"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":1052130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3baa0e98e2ab917b174073a7e8b6c13b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"slaakso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1052130/slaakso"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4097,"user_id":1052130,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3baa0e98e2ab917b174073a7e8b6c13b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"slaakso","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1052130/slaakso"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570284629,"last_edit_date":1570284629,"creation_date":1570272285,"answer_id":58247552,"question_id":58247289,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58247552","body_markdown":"You can use recursive common table expression:\r\n\r\n    with recursive cte (n) AS\r\n    (\r\n      select distinct cast(u.grade as char(255)) from users u\r\n      union all\r\n      select concat(u.grade, c.n) \r\n      from users u\r\n        join cte c on u.grade != c.n\r\n      where position(u.grade in c.n)=0\r\n        and u.grade &lt;

**COUNTS(n,f,r)** be the number of n-digit numbers such that **n%7 = f** and **REVERSE(n)%7** = r\r\n\r\nThe counts are easy to calculate for **n=1**:\r\n\r\n**COUNTS(1,f,r) = 0** when **f!=r**, since a 1-digit number is the same as its reverse.\r\n\r\n**COUNTS(1,x,x) = 1** when **x &gt;= 3**, and\r\n\r\n**COUNTS(1,x,x) = 2** when **x &lt; 3**, since 7%3=0, 8%3=1, and 9%3=2\r\n\r\nThe counts for other lengths can be figured out by calculating what happens when you add each digit from 0 to 9 to the numbers characterized by the previous counts.\r\n\r\nAt the end, **COUNTS(N,0,0)** is the answer you are looking for.\r\n\r\nIn python, for example, it looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    def getModCounts(len):\r\n        counts=[[0]*7 for i in range(0,7)]\r\n        if len&lt;1:\r\n            return counts\r\n        if len&lt;2:\r\n            counts[0][0] = counts[1][1] = counts[2][2] = 2\r\n            counts[3][3] = counts[4][4] = counts[5][5] = counts[6][6] = 1\r\n            return counts\r\n        prevCounts = getModCounts(len-1)\r\n        for f in range(0,7):\r\n            for r in range(0,7):\r\n                c = prevCounts[f][r]\r\n                rplace=(10**(len-1))%7\r\n                for newdigit in range(0,10):\r\n                    newf=(f*10 + newdigit)%7\r\n                    newr=(r + newdigit*rplace)%7\r\n                    counts[newf][newr]+=c\r\n        return counts\r\n    \r\n    def numFwdAndRevDivisible(len):\r\n        return getModCounts(len)[0][0]\r\n    \r\n    #TEST\r\n    for i in range(0,20):\r\n        print(&quot;{0} -&gt; {1}&quot;.format(i, numFwdAndRevDivisible(i)))\r\n\r\nSee if it gives the answers you&#39;re expecting.  If not, maybe there&#39;s a bug I need to fix:\r\n\r\n    0 -&gt; 0\r\n    1 -&gt; 2\r\n    2 -&gt; 4\r\n    3 -&gt; 22\r\n    4 -&gt; 206\r\n    5 -&gt; 2113\r\n    6 -&gt; 20728\r\n    7 -&gt; 205438\r\n    8 -&gt; 2043640\r\n    9 -&gt; 20411101\r\n    10 -&gt; 204084732\r\n    11 -&gt; 2040990205\r\n    12 -&gt; 20408959192\r\n    13 -&gt; 204085028987\r\n    14 -&gt; 2040823461232\r\n    15 -&gt; 20408170697950\r\n    16 -&gt; 204081640379568\r\n    17 -&gt; 2040816769367351\r\n    18 -&gt; 20408165293673530\r\n    19 -&gt; 204081641308734748\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty good answer when counting up to N is reasonable -- *way* better than brute force, which counts up to 10^N.\r\n\r\nFor very long lengths like N=10^18 (you would probably be asked for a the count mod 1000000007 or something), there is a next-level answer.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a linear relationship between the counts for length *n* and the counts for length **n+1**, and that this relationship can be represented by a 49x49 matrix.  You can exponentiate this matrix to the **N**th power using exponentiation by squaring in O(log N) matrix multiplications, and then just multiply by the single digit counts to get the length N counts.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58247287/how-to-find-the-count-of-numbers-which-are-divisible-by-7/58250739#58250739","title":"How to find the count of numbers which are divisible

is not a good practice to store dates as Strings due to a number of reasons**. e.g: If you want to run a Query to sort your data based on dates you could just go &quot;ORDER BY date&quot; if you stored it properly, but keeping Strings wont allow this. A more detailed explanation can be found here : [Why you shouldnt keep dates as Strings in Database][1]\r\n\r\nSo, a much better way to keep dates would be:\r\n\r\n**If you are using ROOM**\r\n\r\nFor the Entity Classes keep date as java.util.Date type. Like below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Entity(tableName = NoteConstants.TABLE_NAME)\r\n    public class Note {\r\n        @PrimaryKey(autoGenerate = true)\r\n        @ColumnInfo(name = NoteConstants.ATTR_ID)\r\n        private int id;\r\n    \r\n        @ColumnInfo(name = NoteConstants.ATTR_DESCRIPTION)\r\n        private String description;\r\n    \r\n        @ColumnInfo(name = NoteConstants.ATTR_DATE)\r\n        private Date date;\r\n    \r\n        public Note(String description) { \r\n            this.description = description;\r\n            this.date = new Date();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public int getId() {\r\n            return id;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setId(int id) {\r\n            this.id = id;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public String getDescription() {\r\n            return description;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public Date getDate() {\r\n            return date;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        public void setDate(Date date) {\r\n            this.date = date;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nNow We need to define a typeConverter for Java&#39;s Date type which ROOM will use:\r\n\r\n    import androidx.room.TypeConverter;\r\n    \r\n    import java.util.Date;\r\n    \r\n    public class DateConverter {\r\n    \r\n        @TypeConverter\r\n        public static long toTimeStamp(Date date){\r\n            return date == null? null : date.getTime();\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        @TypeConverter\r\n        public static Date toDate(Long timeStamp){\r\n            return timeStamp == null ? null : new Date(timeStamp);\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\nfinally, we need to specify the type converters in the ROOM @Database class using @TypeConverters:\r\n\r\n\r\n    @Database(entities = {Note.class}, version = 1) \r\n    @TypeConverters(DateConverter.class)\r\n    public abstract class NoteDatabase extends RoomDatabase {\r\n    \r\n        private static String DB_NAME = &quot;note_database&quot;;\r\n        private static NoteDatabase instance;\r\n    \r\n        public abstract NoteDAO getNoteDao();\r\n    \r\n        public static synchronized NoteDatabase getInstance(Context context) {\r\n            if (instance == null) {\r\n                instance = Room.databaseBuilder(context.getApplicationContext(),\r\n                        NoteDatabase.class, DB_NAME)\r\n                        .fallbackToDestructiveMigration() \r\n                        .build();\r\n            }\r\n            return instance;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n\r\n**If you are not using ROOM and using raw SQLite openHelper:**\r\n\r\nJust keep the long timestamp in the database and use the type conversion methods we built above manually to get the Date from the long timestamp and vice versa.\r\n\r\n\r\n
