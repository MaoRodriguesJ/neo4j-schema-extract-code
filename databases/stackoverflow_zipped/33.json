But I&#39;m just not understanding how arrow function lexical scope applies to objects -- I&#39;ve been working with classes in React, and there it&#39;s always clear that the `this` that the arrow function bound to was the class.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in this example (from https://medium.com/tfogo/advantages-and-pitfalls-of-arrow-functions-a16f0835799e)\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n     let obj = {\r\n          myVar: &#39;foo&#39;,\r\n          \r\n          myFunc: function() { \r\n            console.log(this.myVar)  \r\n          \r\n            setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n              console.log(this.myVar)\r\n            }, 1000)\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe arrow function should bind `this` correctly, obviating doing a `bind`.  But this is from lexical scope?  In what sense? Because the next scope is that of the function `myFunc` and this function&#39;s lexical parent scope is `obj`?\r\n\r\nBut then they give this example\r\n\r\n    let obj = {\r\n      myVar: &#39;foo&#39;,\r\n      \r\n      myFunc: () =&gt; { \r\n        console.log(this.myVar)  \r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    obj.myFunc() // undefined\r\n\r\nwhere correct binding of `this` does not happen.  Is this because there is no function surrounding the arrow function, and so the next lexical scope is the global context?\r\n\r\nTo sum it up: is it true that the &#39;lexical scope&#39; here is simply that same lexical scope defined by functions, and that `this` with arrow functions is simply to look for the parent of the next containing function?  \r\n\r\nI promise you I understood this (or thought I did) a while ago, but &#39;use it or lose it&#39;, I guess -- ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525247/what-is-the-mechanism-for-lexical-scope-binding-inside-object-methods-javascrip","title":"What is the mechanism for lexical scope binding inside object methods (Javascript)?"},{"tags":["python","xml","elementtree","typing","magic-methods"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":6621008,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f23990bd8263b9b14d56819506bcabf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"黄俊杰","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6621008/%e9%bb%84%e4%bf%8a%e6%9d%b0"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34914,"user_id":407651,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6e1f48e20177ed6c4c3197a9a92f48e5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"mzjn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/407651/mzjn"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":21,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571847041,"creation_date":1571841244,"last_edit_date":1571847041,"question_id":58525246,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58525246","body_markdown":"I have a class `Xml` used for modifying an `xml.etree.ElementTree.ElementTree` object:\r\n```python\r\nfrom xml.etree import ElementTree\r\n\r\nclass Xml:\r\n    def __init__(self, file_path: str):\r\n        self.__root = ElementTree.Element()\r\n        self.__file = file_path\r\n\r\n    def __del__(self):\r\n        tree = ElementTree.ElementTree(self.__root)\r\n        tree.write(self.__file)\r\n```\r\nthis code works fine(xml file is rewrited).

think that you are doing way too much work by yourself. Today there are 2 major known libraries that are used to work with JSON. One is Jackson-JSON (otherwise known as &quot;Fast XML&quot; - go figure...) and the other is GSON - a Google library based on Jackson-JSON but also supports passing binary objects. I personally prefer Jackson-JSON, but that&#39;s the matter of personal preference. For GSON library look [here][1]. For Jackson look [here][2]. For Maven artifacts for Jackson look [here][3]. If you choose to work with Jackson, then the main class that you need is [ObjectMapper][4].\r\nStart from looking into methods `readValue()` and `writeValue()`. Look for endless examples on the web on how to work with it. This should give you a good start.\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\nAnyway, both of those libraries allow you to produce well-formatted JSON. For Gson:\r\n\r\n      String content = new String(Files.readAllBytes(resource.toPath()));\r\n    \r\n        Gson gson = new GsonBuilder().setPrettyPrinting().create();\r\n        JsonParser jp = new JsonParser();\r\n        JsonElement je = jp.parse(content);\r\n        String prettyJsonString = gson.toJson(je);\r\n        System.out.println(prettyJsonString);\r\n        \r\n        return prettyJsonString;\r\n\r\nFor Jackson-JSON:\r\n\r\n      ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();\r\n        mapper.enable(SerializationFeature.INDENT_OUTPUT);\r\n        String prettyJsonString = mapper.writeValueAsString(content);\r\n    \r\n        return prettyJsonString;\r\n\r\nBy far less work then you have done and by far better tested.

The warning relies on the fact that your bins depend on the data in each group. Since the bin names (aka `labels`) are set automatically, you get different factor levels for each group. Internally, dplyr binds all groups together you essentially join them. When joining, unequal factor labels shouldnt be matched together (you just see the strings buts it is stored as numerics underneath). Since you would rather keep the label of each value than the numeric, dplyr converts it into characters. \r\nSee this example where I do the grouping by hand:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset.seed(0)\r\ndplyr::tibble(x = rnorm(100), group = rep(c(&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;), 50)) %&gt;% \r\n dplyr::group_by(group) %&gt;% \r\n  mutate(bin = OneR::bin(x, nbins = 10))\r\n\r\nset.seed(0)\r\ndata1 &lt;- dplyr::tibble(x = rnorm(100), group = rep(c(&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;), 50)) %&gt;% \r\n  filter(group == &quot;a&quot;) %&gt;% \r\n  mutate(bin = OneR::bin(x, nbins = 10))\r\n\r\nset.seed(0)\r\ndata2 &lt;- dplyr::tibble(x = rnorm(100), group = rep(c(&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;), 50)) %&gt;% \r\n  filter(group == &quot;b&quot;) %&gt;% \r\n  mutate(bin =

I was able to find code to help put together the cosine similarity calculator (&#39;cosine_sim&#39;), and then the instructor gave us the code that performs the kmeans clustering (&#39;randCent&#39; and &#39;kmeans&#39;).  All three functions are below.\r\n\r\nIn order to write the function that uses these outputs, I&#39;ve tried running this kmeans functions to see the shape/type of outputs it creates.  However, it seems to run forever.  This isn&#39;t that surprising, considering my training data has 2,000 rows and the there are 9,328 columns (word frequencies).  I let it run for 9-10 hours overnight and this morning it was still running.  I tried making a smaller training set--even one with only 5 rows, and it still runs forever.

1\r\n    Now : 2\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to do this with using three different classes? Rather than array usage I am curious if we can take advantage of classes. If possible I can also use nested classes. My only constraint is that `Starter` and `Stopper` classes must be separated from each other since in my project I am using them as `QThread` subclasses. Which leads them to override their run method in a\r\ndifferent way.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525185/how-to-modify-same-variable-with-different-classes","title":"How to modify same variable with different classes?"},{"tags":["postgresql","postgis","spatial-query","srid"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c9fa98d9ed7f1c0d0dbabbc525264d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JayHay02","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252533/jayhay02"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841784,"post_id":58525286,"comment_id":103375641,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525183/set-srid-in-view-from-xy-data/58525286#comment103375641_58525286"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":5152,"user_id":7635569,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/wQall.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JGH","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7635569/jgh"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571841341,"creation_date":1571841341,"answer_id":58525286,"question_id":58525183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58525286","body_markdown":"Just move the `st_setSRID` up:\r\n\r\n\r\n    CREATE  VIEW V_Station_Locations AS\r\n          SELECT S.station_id, S.station_name, \r\n               ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint(V.x_coord, V.y_coord),28350) as geom\r\n     FROM  STATION S\r\n     INNER JOIN SUBURB_VERTEX V ON (S.vertex_id=V.vertex_id)","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525183/set-srid-in-view-from-xy-data/58525286#58525286","title":"Set SRID in View From XY Data"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12252533,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0c9fa98d9ed7f1c0d0dbabbc525264d1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JayHay02","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12252533/jayhay02"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2669,"user_id":2275388,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/47b224367317978c24098291153cb1c6?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jim Jones","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2275388/jim-jones"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":11,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571841341,"creation_date":1571841078,"last_edit_date":1571841168,"question_id":58525183,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58525183","body_markdown":"Trying to create a view that joins two tables, converts XY coord data into a sinlge spatial point, and sets the SRID value.

I can deal with CORS later to be able to playback the files.\r\n\r\nIf any other details are needed, let me know and I can post them here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccess LOG:\r\n```\r\n::1 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:05:10 +0100] &quot;OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0&quot; 200 - &quot;-&quot; &quot;Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) PHP/5.4.16 (internal dummy connection)&quot;\r\n\r\n::1 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:05:11 +0100] &quot;OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0&quot; 200 - &quot;-&quot; &quot;Apache/2.4.6 (CentOS) PHP/5.4.16 (internal dummy connection)&quot;\r\n\r\n192.168.1.72 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:06:41 +0100] &quot;GET /cosmin/ HTTP/1.1&quot; 200 675 &quot;-&quot; &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.120 Safari/537.36&quot;\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:18 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/audio_0_eng/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 300 &quot;-&quot; &quot;KulaByte/5.0&quot;\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:19 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_5/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:18 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_3/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:18 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_1/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:18 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_0/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:18 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_2/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:19 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_4/volume_2946_0000/segment_0000.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_3/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_1/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_2/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_4/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_0/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n\r\n192.168.1.24 - - [22/Oct/2019:16:33:31 +0100] &quot;PUT /cosmin/video_5/volume_2946_0000/segment_0001.ts HTTP/1.1&quot; 405 296\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525126/how-to-fix-405-method-not-allowed-hls-in-apache-server","title":"How to fix &quot;405 - method not allowed - HLS&quot; in Apache server"},{"tags":["java","file","rmi"],"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11799163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/112101676772539/picture?type=large","display_name":"Peter Jolo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799163/peter-jolo"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14,"user_id":11799163,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/112101676772539/picture?type=large","display_name":"Peter Jolo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11799163/peter-jolo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571841175,"creation_date":1571840851,"last_edit_date":1571841175,"question_id":58525125,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58525125","body_markdown":"my program does not see the line in the client, I want the server to find all the files in the directory and for the directory line to be stored in the client, I made a separate program, it worked like I had a line where the directory was written and the whole search process now I want to implement this in RMI.\r\n\r\nRMI Server.java\r\n\r\n    public class RMIServer implements RMIInterface {\r\n     \r\n    \tpublic static final String BINDING_NAME = &quot;sample/HelloService&quot;;\r\n     \r\n    \tpublic Object directory(String directory) {\r\n    \t\tString string = &quot;Hello, &quot; + directory + &quot;!

reason you are getting those error messages is that `intArray` is not declared as an array, it&#39;s actually an integer initialized to `MAX_LENGTH`. This means that when you try to pass it to your functions, the compiler is attempting to convert `int` to `int*` (a decayed array). To fix that, just change the declaration of `intArray` to\r\n```\r\nint intArray[MAX_LENGTH];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also be fixed by changing your arrays to [`std::vector&lt;int&gt;`][1] (you are using C++after all). This would also make sorting your arrays easier since you can use [`std::sort`][2] (if you run your fixed code, you will see it actually doesn&#39;t sort right). It would also eliminate the need to limit the number of input `int`s to `50`.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Since others have said that this is a good option, I&#39;m going to include it here. However, I have never used `std::array` myself, so I have no advice I can offer on this structure.

The flash should be very brief. After it flashes, it should go to the background color (controlled by shadow_mark) of black. Note that I do not want dots to float around, only stay where they are (see solution to this question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56411604/how-to-make-dots-in-gganimate-appear-and-not-transition). \r\n\r\nNo. 2.

The dots do not only flash momentarily, but flash much too long. In other words, I would like to see a red dot briefly, then black dot, then red dot, etc.\r\n2. There is also a problem with when the flash begins. This is illustrated when the dot turns to black (because `data` is missing day 3 for the (x=2,y=1) dot) as expected. However it turns to black partway through day 3 and turns back to red partway through day 4, but I would like it to turn to black exactly at when day 3 begins and flash red exactly when day 4 begins. Note that I am not sure if this time misalignment is caused by `transition_time` behavior or the subtitle `frame_time` behavior or something else.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525111/how-to-control-appearance-of-flashing-dots-in-gganimate","title":"How to control appearance of flashing dots in gganimate"},{"tags":["regex","regex-lookarounds"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3143,"user_id":7431860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Jko.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7431860/nick-reed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841021,"post_id":58525110,"comment_id":103375212,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525110/regex-with-negative-lookahead-does-work-with-zero-or-more-preceeding-whitespaces#comment103375212_58525110"},{"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":2251275,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43cb099eed293897f79e2488c2b24d76?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Alexander Biryukov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2251275/alexander-biryukov"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3143,"user_id":7431860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Jko.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7431860/nick-reed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841175,"post_id":58525110,"comment_id":103375303,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525110/regex-with-negative-lookahead-does-work-with-zero-or-more-preceeding-whitespaces#comment103375303_58525110"},{"owner":{"reputation":3143,"user_id":7431860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Jko.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7431860/nick-reed"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571841842,"post_id":58525110,"comment_id":103375667,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525110/regex-with-negative-lookahead-does-work-with-zero-or-more-preceeding-whitespaces#comment103375667_58525110"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":185,"user_id":3475508,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5237ed5ee5b673a0716ff58c8787841d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"LogicalKip","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3475508/logicalkip"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571842395,"creation_date":1571842395,"answer_id":58525641,"question_id":58525110,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58525641","body_markdown":"You can use **atomic groups**, the syntax is `(?&gt;abc)`, it will forbid backtracking and &quot;solidify&quot; the `\\s*:\\s*` part the first time it&#39;s read by the regex engine.\r\n\r\n`(?i)(todo|fixme)(?&gt;\\s*:?\\s*)(?!http|\\w+-\\d+).*`\r\n\r\n(I simplified the jira part, you can upgrade as needed)\r\n\r\nTest on https://regex101.com/r/XNPtQS/1","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525110/regex-with-negative-lookahead-does-work-with-zero-or-more-preceeding-whitespaces/58525641#58525641","title":"Regex with negative lookahead does work with zero or more preceeding whitespaces"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3143,"user_id":7431860,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/P6Jko.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nick Reed","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7431860/nick-reed"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571842676,"creation_date":1571842676,"answer_id":58525737,"question_id":58525110,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58525737","body_markdown":"According to your comments, you want to allow only TODO statements with either a ticket number or a URL after them.

If ```Case``` route was load first, after redirect to ```Shell``` route parent will stay the case.\r\n\r\nI tried to edit different parameters in the `childRoutes` method, but no success, I just don&#39;t understand is it the issue in the engine, or I just need to specify some additional parameters.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58525056/in-angular-8-router-parent-route-remains-the-same-when-navigating-to-the-route-w","title":"In Angular 8 Router parent route remains the same when navigating to the route with other parent"},{"tags":["react-native","react-native-sound"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9446093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNVSf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zvonimir Capin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9446093/zvonimir-capin"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9446093,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/aNVSf.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Zvonimir Capin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9446093/zvonimir-capin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":9,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571849072,"creation_date":1571840631,"last_edit_date":1571849072,"question_id":58525053,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58525053","body_markdown":"This is just general question.
