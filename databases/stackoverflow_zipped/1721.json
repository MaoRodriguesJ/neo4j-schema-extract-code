facing a peculiar issue. I have a single page app based on SpringBoot, JoinFaces and PrimeFaces 6.2. The page primarily has an Accordion with two tabs.\r\n\r\n    Tab 1 - has a &lt;p:fileUpload&gt; //user uploads XML files using it\r\n    Tab 2 - has a &lt;p:layout&gt; //the selected XML file&#39;s content is displayed here, segregated into two &lt;p:layoutunit&gt;\r\n\r\nAfter the Accordion I have a toolbar with a submit button by which I send the selected XML to a back end service that converts the XML data into a PDF. I then display the PDF using PrimeFaces-Extension&#39;s `&lt;pe:documentViewer&gt;` inside a `&lt;p:dialog&gt;`\r\n\r\n**The issue:**\r\nThe flow works fine till I click on refresh on the browser. If I refresh the page, I notice the CSS for the `&lt;p:fileUpload&gt;` and `&lt;p:layout&gt;` goes wrong. (Also, the `&lt;p:fileUpload&gt;` stops working as well).\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1] [![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**Observation 1:**\r\nWhen I compare the HTML source, before and after the refresh I see that after refresh, the page doesn&#39;t have these includes under `&lt;head&gt;`:\r\n\r\n    &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/javax.faces.resource/fileupload/fileupload.css.xhtml?ln=primefaces&amp;amp;v=6.2&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/javax.faces.resource/fileupload/fileupload.js.xhtml?ln=primefaces&amp;amp;v=6.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;link type=&quot;text/css&quot; rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/javax.faces.resource/layout/layout.css.xhtml?ln=primefaces&amp;amp;v=6.2&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/javax.faces.resource/layout/layout.js.xhtml?ln=primefaces&amp;amp;v=6.2&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n\r\nAny idea what may be causing this and how to correct it?\r\n\r\n**Observation 2:**\r\nThe bean KWOMTesterController is currently marked with `@Named`. If I annotate it with `javax.faces.view.ViewScoped` as well, then the UI issue is resolved, but the `&lt;pe:documentViewer&gt;` complains of missing PDF (the bean has a `DefaultStreamedContent` field, where I store the PDF data).\r\n\r\n**Code snippet:**\r\nHere is my XHTML snippet:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p:accordionPanel id=&quot;mainpanel&quot;

Any help or sense?? \r\n\r\nThanks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132970/intent-extras-on-service-activity","title":"Intent extras on Service-Activity"},{"tags":["java","jenkins","jenkins-plugins","hudson","jelly"],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":10336387,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_KF1zR6Iog0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAIPQ/yzbyPbK7-ck/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Dinh Luong","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10336387/dinh-luong"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":13,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569581139,"creation_date":1569581139,"question_id":58132969,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132969","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to modify a Jenkins plugins a bit to get the `key, value` pairs for reading the global environment.

What i have done so far is adding the extra text field like below :\r\n\r\n```\r\n &lt;f:section title=&quot;Container Overrides&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;f:entry title=&quot;Command&quot; field=&quot;command&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;f:textbox /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/f:entry&gt;\r\n        &lt;f:entry title=&quot;vCPU&quot; field=&quot;vcpu&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;f:textbox /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/f:entry&gt;\r\n        &lt;f:entry title=&quot;Memory (Mb)&quot; field=&quot;memory&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;f:textbox /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/f:entry&gt;\r\n        &lt;f:entry title=&quot;Environment Variables&quot; field=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;\r\n            &lt;f:textbox /&gt;\r\n        &lt;/f:entry&gt;\r\n    &lt;/f:section&gt;\r\n```\r\n[![Rendered Jelly UI][2]][2]\r\nwhile inside the backend code, it was defined (by the previous maintainer) like:\r\n```\r\nprivate ContainerOverrides getContainerOverrides() {\r\n        ContainerOverrides containerOverrides = new ContainerOverrides();\r\n        if(!command.get(0).contentEquals(&quot;&quot;)) containerOverrides.setCommand(command);\r\n        if(memory != null)  containerOverrides.setMemory(memory);\r\n        if(vcpu != null)    containerOverrides.setVcpus(vcpu);\r\n        if(environment != null) containerOverrides.setEnvironment(mapToColl(environment));\r\n\r\n        return containerOverrides;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static Collection&lt;KeyValuePair&gt; mapToColl(Map&lt;String, String&gt; map) {\r\n        List&lt;KeyValuePair&gt; ret = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n        for(Map.Entry&lt;String, String&gt; e : map.entrySet())\r\n            ret.add(new KeyValuePair().withName(e.getKey()).withValue(e.getValue()));\r\n\r\n        return ret;\r\n\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my question is could it be possible to re-config the jelly configuration so that it can provide enough key-value pair to the back-end code above ? If yes then what should i need to do to make it ?

Since most installations are done with `pip`, which never creates zipped egg installations, running into a zipped package installation is more rare these days anyway.\r\n\r\nYou then only have to worry about someone zipping up packages manually into a zipfile to add to `sys.path`, a use case you could choose to not support. That&#39;s a different form of zipped packages; eggs are zipfiles for one installable project (supported by `pkg_resources`) and storing them in a directory that&#39;s listed on `sys.path`. `pkg_resources` can only support the latter, not the former.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to support a zipped egg, then for your specific case, it&#39;ll be easier to use the [`pkg_resources` API for resource extraction](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html#resource-extraction), because while it may be &#39;slower&#39;, it also supports full directory trees. From the `resource_filename()` documentation:\r\n\r\n&gt; If the named resource is a directory, then all resources within that directory (including subdirectories) are also extracted.\r\n\r\nI&#39;d use it like this:\r\n\r\n    try:\r\n        www_location = pkg_resources.resource_filename(&quot;dv&quot;, &quot;www_folder&quot;)\r\n        shutil.copytree(www_location, dir_path)\r\n    finally:\r\n        pkg_resources.cleanup_resources()\r\n\r\nResources inside packages found in a zipfile directly added to `sys.path` can&#39;t be accessed via `pkg_resources`. For that you need the newer [`importlib.resources` module](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.html#module-importlib.resources) (or it&#39;s [backport](https://importlib-resources.readthedocs.io/)), but this API doesn&#39;t support arbitrary directory structures. The [`importlib.resources.path()` function documenation](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.html#importlib.resources.path) states:\r\n\r\n&gt; *package* is either a name or a module object which conforms to the `Package` requirements. *resource* is the name of the resource to open within package; it may not contain path separators and it may not have sub-resources (i.e. **it cannot be a directory**).\r\n\r\n(bold emphasis mine).\r\n\r\nWhile you can find directories within a package by using [`importlib.resources.contents()`](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/importlib.html#importlib.resources.contents), you can&#39;t actually access the contents of those directories unless they are themselves Python packages (so have a `__init__.py` file in them). The *implementation* of those functions for traditional, non-zipped packages will still give you access to the directory when using `importlib.resources.path()`, you can&#39;t do the same when the package is contained in a `.zip` archive.\r\n\r\n`importlib.resources` is a better, future proof path to support. To support that you could zip up the `www_folder` resource tree *in your source and wheel distributions*, and then use `with importlib.resources.path(&quot;dv&quot;, &quot;www_folder.zip&quot;) as www_location: www_zip = zipfile.open(www_location)` and extract the contents from that zipfile object to the destination.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132947/extract-folder-from-python-package-resource/58133640#58133640","title":"Extract folder from python package resource"}],"owner":{"reputation":1618,"user_id":4629950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/001a96e6db51b7c668f813a78565df84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4629950/thomas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1618,"user_id":4629950,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":74,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/001a96e6db51b7c668f813a78565df84?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Thomas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4629950/thomas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58133640,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569588479,"creation_date":1569581034,"last_edit_date":1569588479,"question_id":58132947,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132947","body_markdown":"In my local version of a package I am trying to distribute, I have the following code:\r\n\r\n    shutil.copytree(WWW_LOCATION, dir_path)\r\n\r\n`WWW_LOCATION` is a subfolder of my python module containing some static files and folders:\r\n\r\n    dv\r\n      \\dv\r\n         mytool.py\r\n         \\www_folder\r\n           \\somefolders_and_files\r\n      setup.py\r\n      MANIFEST.in\r\n      README.md\r\n      LICENSE\r\n      setup.cfg\r\n\r\nIn my code, after execution, I need to copy this whole folder to a user-specified location together with some files generated on the fly.

So I&#39;ve tried just to `return false` (like do not ever update) but it still does. As the last try I&#39;ve used `PureComponent` but it is still being rerendered.\r\n\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n### Question\r\n\r\nHow can I stop children re-rendering if the parent list changes and why is ShouldComponentUpdate never called?\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n### Edit\r\nI&#39;ve noticed something what I didn&#39;t mention in question, I&#39;m sorry for that. I am using **context**. If I don&#39;t use context -&gt; it&#39;s ok. Is there any chance to stop re-render while using context? (I&#39;m not using context on updated item - values of context didn&#39;t change).\r\n\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n### Example\r\nI&#39;ve **parent class** which iterates list and renders TaskPreview component for each item of list:\r\n```javascript\r\nclass Dashboard extends React.Component\r\n{\r\n   constructor(props) {\r\n      this.state = {\r\n         tasks: {},\r\n      };\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   onTaskUpdate=(task)=&gt;\r\n      this.setState(prevState =&gt; ({\r\n         tasks: {...prevState.tasks, [task._id]: task}\r\n      }));\r\n\r\n   // ... some code\r\n\r\n   render() {\r\n      return (\r\n         &lt;div&gt;\r\n             {(!Object.entries(this.props.tasks).length)\r\n                ? null\r\n                : this.props.tasks.map((task,index) =&gt; \r\n                     &lt;TaskPreview key={task._id} task={task} onChange={this.onTaskUpdate}/&gt;\r\n             })}\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      )\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I&#39;ve children **TaskPreview** class:\r\n```javascript\r\nclass TaskPreview extends React.Component\r\n{\r\n   shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps) {\r\n        console.log(&#39;This log is never shown in console&#39;);\r\n        return false; // just never!\r\n   }\r\n\r\n   render() {\r\n        console.log(&#39;task rendered:&#39;,this.props.task._id); // indicates rerender\r\n        return(&lt;div&gt;Something from props&lt;/div&gt;);\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n\r\nTaskPreview.contextType = TasksContext;\r\nexport default TaskPreview;\r\n```\r\n\r\n-------\r\n\r\nAs @Nicolae Maties suggested I&#39;ve tried to use Object.keys for iteration instead of direct map but it still doesn&#39;t call &quot;shouldComponentUpdate&quot; and still being re-rendered even if there is no changes.\r\n\r\nUpdated code:\r\n```javascript\r\nrender() {\r\n      return (\r\n         &lt;div&gt;\r\n             {(!Object.entries(this.props.tasks).length)\r\n                ? null\r\n                : Object.keys(this.props.tasks).map((key,index) =&gt; {\r\n                     let task = this.props.tasks[key];\r\n                     &lt;TaskPreview key={task._id} task={task}/&gt;\r\n                }\r\n             })}\r\n         &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      )\r\n   }\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53631597/shouldcomponentupdate-is-not-never-called","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132922/shouldcomponentupdate-is-not-being-called","title":"shouldComponentUpdate() is not being called"},{"tags":["node.js","mongodb"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12130098,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/535205427027218/picture?type=large","display_name":"Nethmi Ishara","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12130098/nethmi-ishara"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":16,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569580907,"creation_date":1569580907,"question_id":58132918,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132918","body_markdown":"I am trying to connect to MongoDB server running on a docker container from my node server and retry to connect in an occation of a disconnection.

You don&#39;t want to observe the row multiple times in the other dimensions, which is why you don&#39;t want to flatten.\r\n\r\nWith your original data format, your dimension definition would look something like:\r\n\r\n    var yearsDimension = cf.dimension(d =&gt; d.turnover[0], true);\r\n\r\nThe key function for a tag dimension should return an array, here of years.\r\n\r\nThis feature is still fairly new, as crossfilter goes, and a couple of [minor](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/issues/127) [bugs](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/issues/141) were found this year. These bugs should be easy to avoid. The feature has gotten a lot of use and no major bugs have been found.\r\n\r\nAlways beware with tag dimensions, since any aggregations will add up to more than 100% - in your case 300%. But if you are doing averages across companies for a year, this should not be a problem.\r\n\r\n### pairs of tags and values\r\n\r\nWhat&#39;s unique about your problem is that you not only have multiple keys per row, you also have multiple values associated with those keys.\r\n\r\nAlthough the crossfilter tag dimension feature is handy, it gives you no way to know *which* tag you are looking at when you reduce. Further, the most powerful and general group reduction method, [group.reduce()](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#group_reduce), [doesn&#39;t tell you which key you are reducing.](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/issues/103).\r\n\r\nBut there is one even more powerful way to reduce across the entire crossfilter at once: [dimension.groupAll()](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#dimension_groupAll)\r\n\r\nA *groupAll* object behaves like a group, except that it is fed all of the rows, and it returns only one bin. If you use `dimension.groupAll()` you get a groupAll object that observes all filters except those on that dimension. You can also use [crossfilter.groupAll](https://github.com/crossfilter/crossfilter/wiki/API-Reference#crossfilter_groupAll) if you want a groupAll that observes all filters.\r\n\r\nHere is a solution (using ES6 syntax for brevity) of reduction functions for `groupAll.reduce()` that reduces all of the rows into an object of year =&gt; {count, total}. \r\n\r\n    function avg_paired_tag_reduction(idTag, valTag) {\r\n      return {\r\n        add(p, v) {\r\n          v[idTag].forEach((id, i) =&gt; {\r\n            p[id] = p[id] || {count: 0, total: 0};\r\n            ++p[id].count;\r\n            p[id].total += v[valTag][i];\r\n          });\r\n          return p;\r\n        },\r\n      \tremove(p, v) {\r\n          v[idTag].forEach((id, i) =&gt; {\r\n            console.assert(p[id]);\r\n            --p[id].count;\r\n            p[id].total -= v[valTag][i];\r\n          })\r\n          return p;\r\n        },\r\n        init() {\r\n          return {};\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIt will be fed every row and it will loop over the keys and values in the row, producing a count and total for every key. It assumes that the length of the key array and the value array are the same.\r\n\r\nThen we can use a [&quot;fake group&quot;](https://github.com/dc-js/dc.js/wiki/FAQ#fake-groups) to turn the object on demand into the array of {key,value} pairs that dc.js charts expect:\r\n\r\n    function groupall_map_to_group(groupAll) {\r\n      return {\r\n        all() {\r\n          return Object.entries(groupAll.value())\r\n            .map(([key, value]) =&gt; ({key,value}));\r\n        }\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n\r\nUse these functions like this:\r\n\r\n    const red = avg_paired_tag_reduction(&#39;id&#39;, &#39;val&#39;);\r\n    const avgPairedTagGroup = turnoverYearsDim.groupAll().reduce(\r\n      red.add, red.remove, red.init\r\n    );\r\n    console.log(groupall_map_to_group(avgPairedTagGroup).all());\r\n\r\nAlthough it&#39;s possible to compute a running average, it&#39;s more efficient to instead calculate a count and total, as above, and then tell the chart how to compute the average in the value accessor:\r\n\r\n    chart.dimension(turnoverYearsDim)\r\n      .group(groupall_map_to_group(avgPairedTagGroup))\r\n      .valueAccessor(kv =&gt; kv.value.total / kv.value.count)\r\n\r\n[Demo fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/gordonwoodhull/kuhcqwxg/40/).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132895/plotting-aggregated-data-with-sub-columns-in-dc-js/58135255#58135255","title":"Plotting aggregated data with sub-columns in dc.js"}],"owner":{"reputation":168,"user_id":2622511,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c2a865f05e209ac5feda5207c5571d6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Isaac","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2622511/isaac"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":32,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58135255,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570014748,"creation_date":1569580784,"question_id":58132895,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132895","body_markdown":"I have data in the form:\r\n\r\n    data = [..., {id:X,..., turnover:[[2015,2017,2018],[2000000,3000000,2800000]]}, ...];\r\n\r\nMy goal is to plot the year in the x-axis, against the average turnover for all companies currently selected via crossfilter in the y-axis.\r\n\r\nThe years recorded per company are inconsistent, but there should always be three years.\r\n\r\nIf it would help, I can reorganise the data to be in the form:\r\n\r\n    data = [..., {id:X,..., turnover:{2015:2000000, 2017:3000000, 2018:2800000}}, ...];\r\n\r\nHad I been able to reorganise the data further to look like:\r\n\r\n    [...{id:X, ..., year:2015, turnover:2000000},{id:X,...,year:2017,turnover:3000000},{id:X,...,year:2018,turnover:2800000}];

{\r\n  if (request.cmd === &#39;START_TIMER&#39;) {\r\n    timerTime = new Date(request.when);\r\n    timerID = setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n       // the time is app, alert the user.\r\n    }, timerTime.getTime() - Date.now());\r\n  } else if (request.cmd === &#39;GET_TIME&#39;) {\r\n    sendResponse({ time: timerTime });\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**timer.js**\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Call this when the pop-up is shown\r\nchrome.runtime.sendMessage({ cmd: &#39;GET_TIME&#39; }, response =&gt; {\r\n  if (response.time) {\r\n    const time = new Date(response.time);\r\n    startTimer(time)\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n\r\nfunctions startTimer(time) {\r\n  if (time.getTime() &gt; Date.now()) {\r\n    setInterval(() =&gt; {\r\n      // display the remaining time\r\n    }, 1000)\r\n\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction startTime(time) {\r\n  chrome.runtime.sendMessage({ cmd: &#39;START_TIMER&#39;, when: time });\r\n  startTimer(time);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEssentially, when the user starts a timer, you send a message to the background script with a future date for when the timer is done. Then, in the background script you set a timeout to be triggered at that date so you can do something (play a sound) even if the pop-up window is closed.\r\nThen, when the pop-up window is reopened, you send a message to the background script and it will send back the date for the timer that was previously set.\r\n\r\nThis can be improved, for now, this will work correctly as long as the browser is opened for the entire length of the timer, to make it work even if the browser is closed and reopened, you can save and restore the timer&#39;s date from storage.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132891/chrome-timer-extension-how-to-keep-timer-running-even-when-extension-is-closed/58133050#58133050","title":"Chrome timer extension - how to keep timer running even when extension is closed?"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9711455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u3fGqPVeMEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/wyUG1NTxY-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9711455/luka"},"last_editor":{"reputation":8,"user_id":9711455,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u3fGqPVeMEs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAFk/wyUG1NTxY-E/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Luka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9711455/luka"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58133050,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569583086,"creation_date":1569580754,"last_edit_date":1569581319,"question_id":58132891,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132891","body_markdown":"I&#39;m working on my first extension - Tea timer.

So it would check all the records where the cards are that rarity and then pick a random one and load it to the query. \r\n\r\nI have tried using the &quot;ORDER BY Rand() LIMIT 1&quot; but I get a syntax error for some reason. I then also tried to use a for loop and use qryCards.next but that also doesn&#39;t work properly\r\n\r\nI tried this:\r\n```\r\nqryCards.SQL.Add(&#39;SELECT * FROM tblCards WHERE Card_Rarity = &quot;Legendary&quot; ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT 1&#39;);\r\n```\r\nbut I get a syntax error\r\n\r\nI also tried this:\r\n```\r\n with dmCards do\r\n   begin\r\n     qryCards.Close;\r\n     qryCards.SQL.Clear;\r\n\r\n     qryCards.SQL.Add(&#39;SELECT * FROM tblCards WHERE Card_Rarity = &quot;Legendary&quot;&#39;);\r\n     qryCards.Open;\r\n     Randomize;\r\n     iRandom := Random(qryCards.RecordCount) + 1;\r\n\r\n     for i := 1 to iRandom do\r\n       begin\r\n         qryCards.Next;\r\n       end;\r\n\r\n     ShowMessage(qryCards.FieldByName(&#39;Card_Name&#39;).AsString);\r\n\r\n end;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the output to be the name of a random card of that specific rarity, but the actual output is strange and I don&#39;t exactly know how to describe it.

you can solve it using [laravel observers][1]:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nphp artisan make:observer UserObserver --model User\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command will create a `UserObserver.php` file inside `app/Observers` folder.\r\n\r\nAdd this to the `created` function:\r\n\r\n```php\r\npublic function created(User $user)\r\n{\r\n    EndUser::create([\r\n        &#39;username&#39; =&gt;

is my first post so apologies in advance if I am posting to the wrong place or asking a question that has been answered elsewhere - go easy on me!\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, I have a Google Form and a

I have had a good go myself but am now totally stuck!\r\n\r\nI have created [the form][1], [linked it to a sheet][2], written the code, added the trigger and tested by submitting a form.

need to use the same format string and culture in every place where you convert the `DateTime` to string as well. In your sample code, you&#39;re doing\r\n\r\n    DateTime.Now.ToString()\r\n\r\nThis uses the default culture for the thread, and the default format. Unless assigned otherwise, the thread is probably using the local culture info. Instead, you would want to use the same format and the invariant culture:\r\n\r\n    DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss&quot;, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);\r\n\r\n(note the lowercase &quot;dd&quot;. &quot;DD&quot; is not a valid format specifier for date times; these things are case sensitive. Also note the &quot;HH&quot;, which gives a 24-hour value, rather than 12-hour)\r\n\r\nIn practice, just using the invariant culture should be enough for persistence. Cultures already include default datetime formats, so unless you have  a specific need to use a different format, why not use the default?\r\n\r\nAlso note that `DateTime` *doesn&#39;t have a format*. The format only comes into play when you convert from or to a string. That is the place where you need to ensure the same culture and format is used for both sides of the operation (and that&#39;s why for persistence, especially for data shared between different users or computers, you generally want to use the invariant culture).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132841/datetime-format-any-system-datetime-now-to-dd-mm-yyyy-hhmmss/58132905#58132905","title":"DateTime Format - Any System Datetime.now to &quot;DD/MM/YYYY hh:mm:ss&quot;"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":126223,"user_id":2319407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/98O16.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitry Bychenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2319407/dmitry-bychenko"},"last_editor":{"reputation":126223,"user_id":2319407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/98O16.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Dmitry Bychenko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2319407/dmitry-bychenko"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569584452,"last_edit_date":1569584452,"creation_date":1569583332,"answer_id":58133554,"question_id":58132841,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58133554","body_markdown":"If you need\r\n\r\n&gt;

Following query will give you all the names which are Duplicate, and the first `id` for them:\r\n```\r\nSELECT first_name, last_name, MIN(id) AS first_id \r\nFROM participants \r\nGROUP BY first_name, last_name \r\nHAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1 -- more than one rows means duplicates exist\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the above query as a subquery to update the `pivot` table using a series of Joins:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUPDATE pivot AS m \r\nJOIN participants AS p1 \r\n  ON p1.id = m.participant_id \r\nJOIN (\r\n       SELECT first_name, last_name, MIN(id) AS first_id \r\n       FROM participants \r\n       GROUP BY first_name, last_name \r\n       HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\r\n     ) AS p2 ON p2.first_name = p1.first_name \r\n                AND p2.last_name = p1.last_name \r\n                AND p2.first_id &lt;&gt; p1.id  -- avoid the original row\r\nSET m.participant_id = p2.first_id  -- update the duplicate row&#39;s id to first id\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Now, you can `DELETE` the duplicate rows using the same subquery (to find duplicates):\r\n\r\n```\r\nDELETE p1 FROM participants AS p1 \r\nJOIN (\r\n       SELECT first_name, last_name, MIN(id) AS first_id \r\n       FROM participants \r\n       GROUP BY first_name, last_name \r\n       HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1\r\n     ) AS p2 ON p2.first_name = p1.first_name \r\n                AND p2.last_name = p1.last_name \r\n                AND p2.first_id &lt;&gt; p1.id  -- avoid the original row\r\n```\r\n\r\n - Finally, fix the problem at your data definition level, to avoid this happening again, by defining a `UNIQUE` constraint on the `(first_name, last_name)`\r\n```\r\nALTER TABLE participants ADD CONSTRAINT unq_idx_name UNIQUE(first_name, last_name);\r\n```\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58132802/mysql-merge-entries-in-pivot-table-based-on-joined-table-duplicate-entries/58132938#58132938","title":"MySQL: Merge entries in pivot table based on joined table duplicate entries"}],"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":12023581,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DP8PrLOK9U0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reSBMoeF6kImseBGtk-resLKNwlzw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"thelaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12023581/thelaw"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":23,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569580995,"creation_date":1569580422,"question_id":58132802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58132802","body_markdown":"I have 2 tables, one of participants:\r\n\r\n    +----+------------+-----------+\r\n    | id | First Name | Last Name |\r\n    +----+------------+-----------+\r\n    |  0 | John       | Snow      |\r\n    |  1 | John       | Snow      |\r\n    |  2 | Michael    | Jackson   |\r\n    +----+------------+-----------+\r\n\r\nAnd one pivot table which connects participants with events:\r\n\r\n    +----+----------------+----------+\r\n    | id | participant_id | event_id |\r\n    +----+----------------+----------+\r\n    |  0 |              0 |       12 |\r\n    |  1 |              1 |       35 |\r\n    |  2 |              2 |       35 |\r\n    +----+----------------+----------+\r\n\r\nBy mistake there are duplicate entries in the participants&#39; table.\r\n\r\nHow I can delete duplicate entries in participants&#39; table and update accordingly the pivot table?

I am performing some minor modifications once the widget has rendered using the &quot;afterrender&quot; event. [See after render event here][1]. All is working fine except one modification which attempts to validate whether the user has entered a properly formatted email address before resetting or unlocking their account. (Okta does not provide this and will allow the user to submit jibberish). \r\n\r\nThe problem is that I can seem to disable the anchor tag button and change its behavior while it waits for a proper email address to be entered:\r\n`&lt;a data-se=&quot;email-button&quot; class=&quot;button button-primary button-wide email-button link-button&quot; href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;Reset via Email&lt;/a&gt;`\r\n\r\nI can add to the click event functionality, but I cannot suspend its behavior.

What did work is if I changed the anchor tag to a p tag temporarily, and then changed it back. But when did this in code with .replacewith(...) or .after(...).remove(), the submit function did not work correctly with the a tag and form. It just returned to the main login screen, and does not send an email even if the address is associated with an account.\r\n\r\nHere is the current code where I was testing preventDefault (.after(...).remove() attempts are commented out).

I&#39;ve realised I&#39;ve got discord wrong and it&#39;s all a moot point.
