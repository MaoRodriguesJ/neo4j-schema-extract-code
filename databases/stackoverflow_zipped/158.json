What am I missing here?\r\n\r\nI have also verified that I can put item using AWS CLI (after performing the STS call).\r\n\r\nIs there any Java API that I can to specify which dynamodb arn that I want to put the item to?\r\n\r\nError message:\r\n\r\n    User: arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_A:assumed-role/Assume-role/INSTANCE_ID is not authorized to perform: dynamodb:PutItem on resource: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:ACCOUNT_A:table/TABLE_NAME (Service: AmazonDynamoDBv2; Status Code: 400; Error Code: AccessDeniedException)\r\n\r\nPolicy on account A:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n&quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;, \r\n&quot;Statement&quot;: [ { \r\n&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, \r\n&quot;Action&quot;: [ &quot;sts:AssumeRole&quot;, &quot;sts:GetFederationToken&quot; ], \r\n&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:iam::AccountA:role/PutItem&quot; }, \r\n\r\n{ &quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, \r\n&quot;Action&quot;: [ &quot;sts:DecodeAuthorizationMessage&quot;, &quot;sts:GetAccessKeyInfo&quot;, &quot;sts:GetCallerIdentity&quot; ], \r\n&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot; } ]\r\n }\r\n```\r\n\r\nPolicy on Account B:\r\n```\r\n{ \r\n&quot;Version&quot;: &quot;2012-10-17&quot;, \r\n&quot;Statement&quot;: [ { \r\n&quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;VisualEditor0&quot;, \r\n&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, \r\n&quot;Action&quot;: [ &quot;dynamodb:PutItem&quot;, &quot;dynamodb:UpdateItem&quot;, &quot;dynamodb:UpdateTable&quot; ], \r\n&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;arn:aws:dynamodb:region:accB:table/table name&quot; },\r\n\r\n{ \r\n&quot;Sid&quot;: &quot;VisualEditor1&quot;, \r\n&quot;Effect&quot;: &quot;Allow&quot;, \r\n&quot;Action&quot;: &quot;dynamodb:*&quot;, \r\n&quot;Resource&quot;: &quot;*&quot; } ] \r\n}\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497121/dynamodb-cross-account-put-item","title":"Dynamodb Cross-account put_item"},{"tags":["c++","c","visual-studio","decimal"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":8487340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc51fe61ebda41befdd8704d76458f9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amal John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8487340/amal-john"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571719870,"post_id":58497120,"comment_id":103323655,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497120/malloc-h198-error-c2065-alloca-s-marker-size-undeclared-identifier#comment103323655_58497120"},{"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":8487340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc51fe61ebda41befdd8704d76458f9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amal John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8487340/amal-john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571720499,"post_id":58497120,"comment_id":103323801,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497120/malloc-h198-error-c2065-alloca-s-marker-size-undeclared-identifier#comment103323801_58497120"},{"owner":{"reputation":219,"user_id":11872808,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/29d7b759b09573f7750c178d99015eca?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jeaninez - MSFT","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11872808/jeaninez-msft"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571725785,"post_id":58497120,"comment_id":103325480,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497120/malloc-h198-error-c2065-alloca-s-marker-size-undeclared-identifier#comment103325480_58497120"},{"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12205558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03e0f40cbaccd8d8c10acc291856e81a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adder bill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12205558/adder-bill"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":59,"user_id":8487340,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fc51fe61ebda41befdd8704d76458f9c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Amal John","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8487340/amal-john"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571729291,"post_id":58497120,"comment_id":103327130,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497120/malloc-h198-error-c2065-alloca-s-marker-size-undeclared-identifier#comment103327130_58497120"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12205558,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/03e0f40cbaccd8d8c10acc291856e81a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adder bill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12205558/adder-bill"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571718769,"creation_date":1571718769,"question_id":58497120,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58497120","body_markdown":"Environment : Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition\r\n\r\nCould Anyone suggest how to fix this errors?

x.id === id);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAssuming you don&#39;t really need the Observables.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497108/my-observable-is-not-adhering-to-the-define-model-in-angular/58513716#58513716","title":"My Observable is not adhering to the define model In Angular"}],"owner":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10653367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091d54ab6a6ae7b53361c5a5eaead40f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vwegbacity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10653367/vwegbacity"},"last_editor":{"reputation":4,"user_id":10653367,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/091d54ab6a6ae7b53361c5a5eaead40f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"vwegbacity","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10653367/vwegbacity"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":38,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":3,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571788692,"creation_date":1571718624,"last_edit_date":1571732211,"question_id":58497108,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58497108","body_markdown":"Good morning guys, I am new to Angular and Observables, I am trying to have my code return an observabe and filter the list but my typescript compiler is given me an error.\r\nthis is what i have done so far.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n     \r\n\r\n&gt;

lots of techniques that cover the simplicity of the question, here are my requirements:\r\n\r\n 1. I&#39;d like an `&lt;hr /&gt;` element to be visible, with a portion of it cut out\r\n 2. The width of the `&lt;hr /&gt;` is unknown\r\n 3. The cutout region has fixed dimensions and must be centered on top of the `&lt;hr /&gt;`\r\n 4. Use 1x `&lt;hr /&gt;` element\r\n 5. Supported in IE11 and Safari 11, as well as modern browsers\r\n\r\nDue to the browser support, I think I am left with using clipPath within an SVG and setting that as the clipping region via CSS on the `&lt;hr /&gt;` element.\r\n\r\nThe following demo *is not tested in IE/Safari yet* and it highlights my attempts to firstly draw an SVG shape with a portion cut out. That part is nearly fine apart from my requirements #2 and #3 because I don&#39;t yet have a fluid filling path with a fixed and centred second path inside it.\r\n\r\nRequirement #1 currently fails completely, when I convert the `path` inside the SVG into a `clipPath` and then assign that to the `hr /&gt;` element.\r\n\r\nCodepen demo: https://codepen.io/davewallace/pen/WNNRMoR\r\n\r\nMarkup:\r\n\r\n    &lt;p&gt;1. Aspect ratio in action, box is correctly centered, but I need the black region to stretch all the way to the far left and right edges, leaving the inner cut-out box in the middle.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;hr /&gt;\r\n    \t&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://wwww3org/2000/svg&quot; height=&quot;32&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; viewBox=&quot;0,0,10,10&quot;&gt;\r\n    \t\t&lt;path d=&quot;M 0,0 h 10 v 10 h -10 z\r\n    \t\t\t\t\t\t M 2,2 v  6 h  6 v  -6 z&quot; /&gt; \r\n    \t&lt;/svg&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    \r\n    &lt;p&gt;2. So I tried removing the aspect ratio.

So it&#39;s not &#39;cutting a hole&#39; in the `&lt;hr /&gt;` but stopping and starting it visually. This approach, in my context, would need some magic numbers and isn&#39;t so clean. Pretty sure it&#39;s still accessible in that I am still using 1x `&lt;hr /&gt;` element mostly as it is intended to be used.\r\n - Nothing else so far, but this is to achieve a &quot;fancy horizontal rule&quot; effect, where someone can drop their image/SVG asset into the middle of the horizontal rule without worrying about the horizontal line going under the asset. I also don&#39;t know what the page background colour is, no assumptions can be made about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497068/how-do-i-hide-an-inner-part-of-an-element-from-display","title":"How do I hide an inner part of an element from display?"},{"tags":["node.js","react-native","express","fetch","multer"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":311,"user_id":8667766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/365f483718ff10a70837d9f447f561e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louay Alosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8667766/louay-alosh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571719624,"post_id":58497066,"comment_id":103323595,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497066/why-can-not-find-the-server-route-of-an-express-server-from-react-native-when-tr#comment103323595_58497066"},{"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9979512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sexC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jaime Ramos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9979512/jaime-ramos"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":311,"user_id":8667766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/365f483718ff10a70837d9f447f561e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louay Alosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8667766/louay-alosh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571749757,"post_id":58497066,"comment_id":103338388,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497066/why-can-not-find-the-server-route-of-an-express-server-from-react-native-when-tr#comment103338388_58497066"},{"owner":{"reputation":311,"user_id":8667766,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/365f483718ff10a70837d9f447f561e7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Louay Alosh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8667766/louay-alosh"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571813023,"post_id":58497066,"comment_id":103360041,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497066/why-can-not-find-the-server-route-of-an-express-server-from-react-native-when-tr#comment103360041_58497066"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":9979512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/7sexC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jaime Ramos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9979512/jaime-ramos"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571718363,"creation_date":1571718363,"question_id":58497066,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58497066","body_markdown":"i have configured an express server that use multer as a middleware in order to upload images to GCS, it works as expected and wanted when making the respective request from insomnia, but when trying to do it from my project in react native, i can not even get connected to that route, and actually i do not know the reason and what else to try.\r\nthis is the code from the server:\r\n```\r\nconst storage =\r\n    multer.diskStorage({\r\n        destination: function (req, file, cb) {\r\n            cb(null, &#39;uploads/&#39;)\r\n        },\r\n        filename: function (req, file, cb) {\r\n            cb(null, Date.now() + path.extname(file.originalname))\r\n        }\r\n    })\r\n\r\nconst upload = multer({ storage: storage })\r\napp.listen(3000);\r\napp.use(router)\r\n\r\nrouter.post(&#39;/uploadImage&#39;, upload.single(&#39;file&#39;), async function (req, res) {\r\n    console.log(&quot;se conectaron a /uploadingImage&quot;)...\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This is code from the frontend in react native:**\r\n```\r\n_pickImage = async () =&gt;

have a dataframe like as shown below\r\n\r\n    df = pd.DataFrame({\r\n    &#39;subject_id&#39;:[1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,4],\r\n     &#39;readings&#39; :

works fine(thanks to Jezrael) in Python pandas, when I apply this to real data (more than 4M records), it runs for a long time. So I was trying to use `pyspark` . Please note I already tried `Dask`,`modin`,`pandarallel` which are equivalent to pandas for large scale processing but didn&#39;t help either. What the below codes does is `it generates the summary statistics for each subject for each reading`. You can have a look at the expected output below to get an idea\r\n\r\n    df_op = (df.groupby([&#39;subject_id&#39;,&#39;readings&#39;])[&#39;val&#39;]\r\n            .describe()\r\n            .unstack()\r\n            .swaplevel(0,1,axis=1)\r\n            .reindex(df[&#39;readings&#39;].unique(), axis=1, level=0))\r\n    df_op.columns = df_op.columns.map(&#39;_&#39;.join)\r\n    df_op = df_op.reset_index()\r\n\r\nCan you help me achieve the above operation in pyspark? When I tried the below, it threw an error\r\n\r\n    df.groupby([&#39;subject_id&#39;,&#39;readings&#39;])[&#39;val&#39;] \r\n\r\nFor example - subject_id = 1 has 4 readings but 3 unique readings. So we get 3 * 8 = 24 columns for subject_id = 1. Why 8? Because it&#39;s `MIN,MAX,COUNT,Std,MEAN,25%percentile,50th percentile,75th percentile`. Hope this helps\r\n\r\nWhen I started off with this in pyspark, it returns the below error\r\n\r\n&gt; TypeError: &#39;GroupedData&#39; object is not subscriptable\r\n\r\nI expect my output to be like as shown below\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/EFyQw.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/uCqr4.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497036/how-to-apply-groupby-and-transpose-in-pyspark","title":"How to apply groupby and transpose in Pyspark?"},{"tags":["python","pandas","dataframe"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":9566934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9139bd985cc4655b020e5a3504998a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yusan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9566934/yusan"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571724259,"post_id":58497411,"comment_id":103324865,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497035/how-to-sort-values-not-by-rows-but-by-columns-in-pandas/58497411#comment103324865_58497411"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":423560,"user_id":2901002,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hMDvl.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jezrael","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2901002/jezrael"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571720857,"creation_date":1571720857,"answer_id":58497411,"question_id":58497035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58497411","body_markdown":"Idea is reshape values with [`Series.str.split`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.str.split.html) and [`DataFrame.stack`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.stack.html), then sorting per first level and `time` column, create new order by [`GroupBy.cumcount`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.core.groupby.GroupBy.cumcount.html) and last reshape back to original:\r\n\r\n    df.columns = df.columns.str.split(&#39;_&#39;, expand=True)\r\n    \r\n    df1=df.stack().reset_index(level=1,drop=True).rename_axis(&#39;lvl1&#39;).sort_values([&#39;lvl1&#39;,&#39;time&#39;])\r\n    df1 = df1.set_index(df1.groupby(level=0).cumcount().add(1), append=True)\r\n    \r\n    df1 = df1.unstack().sort_index(axis=1, level=1).rename_axis(None)\r\n    df1.columns = [f&#39;{a}_{b}&#39; for a, b in df1.columns]\r\n    print (df1)\r\n       store_1  time_1  store_2  time_2  store_3  time_3\r\n    0  B-store     4.0  A-store     5.0  C-store     6.0\r\n    1  B-store     3.0  P-store     4.0      NaN     NaN\r\n    2  I-store     9.0  N-store    20.0      NaN     NaN\r\n    3  N-store     2.0  A-store     5.0  L-store     8.0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497035/how-to-sort-values-not-by-rows-but-by-columns-in-pandas/58497411#58497411","title":"How to sort values not by rows, but by columns in Pandas?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":34,"user_id":9566934,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4c9139bd985cc4655b020e5a3504998a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Yusan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9566934/yusan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571724289,"post_id":58497512,"comment_id":103324877,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497035/how-to-sort-values-not-by-rows-but-by-columns-in-pandas/58497512#comment103324877_58497512"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":237,"user_id":8481155,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/957dce17390fbe2930a688171236d95e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ashok KS","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8481155/ashok-ks"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571721520,"creation_date":1571721520,"answer_id":58497512,"question_id":58497035,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58497512","body_markdown":"This maybe a longer way of doing it.

Can I know why the elements are printed out of order, and the best way to fix this?\r\n\r\nThe [standard][1] has the following to say:\r\n&gt; The awk language supplies arrays that are used for storing numbers or strings. Arrays need not be declared. They shall initially be empty, and their sizes shall change dynamically. **The subscripts, or element identifiers, are strings**, providing a **type of associative array** capability. &amp;lt;snip&amp;gt;\r\n\r\n&gt;     for (variable in array)\r\n&gt; which shall iterate, assigning each index of the array to variable in an **unspecified order**.\r\n\r\nSo from this, we know that an array in awk is an [associative array][2], nothing more than a key-value-pair combination. A classic example in the programming world is a binary-tree such as C++&#39;s `std::map`. Usually, ordering needs to be imposed to traverse and search the array efficiently, however standard awk does not give us the option to define such ordering. The standard leaves the key-order a free choice for whoever implements awk. That is also why it states that `for (variable in array)` will traverse the array in an unspecified order. \r\n\r\nGNU awk, on the other hand, allows one to define the key-order on a global level using the array-variable [`PROCINFO[&quot;sorted_in&quot;]`][3] and on a local level, using the [`asorti(source [, dest [, how ] ])`][4] function. The latter will store the keys of array `source` in an integer-indexed array `dest`. The latter is populated such that the order of the keys is defined by the function `how` (`dest[1] &lt; dest[2] &lt; dest[3] &lt; ...` with `how` defining `&lt;`).\r\n\r\nIf you do not want to use GNU awk features and you know you have sorted input, then you can make use of two arrays. One that keeps track of the key-order and one that keeps track of the key-values:\r\n\r\n    { key_order[++c]=&quot;key&quot;\r\n      data[&quot;key&quot;] = &quot;value&quot; }\r\n    END { for(i=1;i&lt;=c;++i) print data[key_order[i]] }\r\n\r\n[1]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/awk.html\r\n[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array\r\n[3]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Controlling-Scanning\r\n[4]: https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html#Array-Sorting-Functions","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58497034/awk-array-is-printing-elements-in-unexpected-order/58499655#58499655","title":"Awk array is printing elements in unexpected order"}],"owner":{"reputation":216,"user_id":3133569,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WH37e.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3133569/user"},"last_editor":{"reputation":216,"user_id":3133569,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":78,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WH37e.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"user","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3133569/user"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":66,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571731455,"creation_date":1571718118,"last_edit_date":1571719058,"question_id":58497034,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58497034","body_markdown":"I am using awk to capture timestamp from a dataset, and print out a value (memory) associated with that timestamp.\r\n\r\nThe following awk code works well to achieve this.\r\n\r\n    awk &#39;\r\n    /show memory compare start/     {getline\r\n                                     start_time = $0;\r\n                                    }\r\n    /show memory compare end/       {getline\r\n                                     end_time = $0;\r\n                                    }\r\n    /mibd_interface/{\r\n            print start_time, $3, &quot;\\n&quot;

Pulling latest image from the [official docker hub page][1].\r\n\r\n        docker pull tensorflow/serving:latest-gpu\r\n\r\n*Please note the label `latest-gpu` in above pull request as it pulls image meant for GPU.*\r\n\r\n2. Running the docker container.\r\n\r\n        sudo docker run -p 8502:8500 --mount type=bind,source=/my_model_dir,target=/models/inception --name tfserve_gpu -e MODEL_NAME=inception --gpus device=3 -t tensorflow/serving:latest-gpu\r\n\r\n*Please note, I&#39;ve passed argument `--gpus device=3` to select the 3rd GPU device. Change it accordingly to select a different GPU device.*\r\n\r\nVerify, if the container has been started by `docker ps` command.\r\n\r\nAlso, verify if the gpu has been allocated for the tfserving docker by `nvidia-smi` command.\r\n\r\n**Output of nvidia-smi**\r\n\r\n[![Output of nvidia-smi command][2]][2]\r\n\r\nBut here seems a little problem. The tfserving docker has consumed all of gpu device memory.\r\n\r\nTo restrict gpu memory usage, use `per_process_gpu_memory_fraction` flag.\r\n\r\n    sudo docker run -p 8502:8500 --mount type=bind,source=/my_model_dir,target=/models/inception --name tfserve_gpu -e MODEL_NAME=inception --gpus device=3 -t tensorflow/serving:latest-gpu  --per_process_gpu_memory_fraction=0.02\r\n\r\n**Output of nvidia-smi**\r\n\r\n[![Output of nvidia-smi command][3]][3]\r\n\r\nNow, we have successfully configured tfserving docker on GPU device with reasonable gpu memory usage.

Specifically I want the distance between them. I haven&#39;t found the right combination of groupby operations to vectorize it.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s a sample df:\r\n```\r\n\r\n   frame_id point_id      x      y cat\r\n0         1        1  1.769  2.491   A\r\n1         1        2  1.024  0.981   A\r\n2         1        3  4.327   9.81   A\r\n3         1        4  5.407   4.33   A\r\n4         1        5  0.936  0.019   B\r\n5         1        6    5.1  7.639   B\r\n6         1        7  9.139  6.721   B\r\n7         1        8  1.954  5.424   B\r\n8         2        1  5.835  9.702   A\r\n9         2        2  1.784  1.374   A\r\n10        2        3   0.23  1.921   A\r\n11        2        4  9.328  5.836   A\r\n12        2        5  5.516  8.971   B\r\n13        2        6  9.108  8.917   B\r\n14        2        7  4.412  1.033   B\r\n15        2        8   1.33  5.898   B\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, with this example, I&#39;d add four columns.

Thus a case for using the same data layer across different types of clients viz. A web application  and/or A desktop application ( electron if you choose so )\r\n\r\n**Step 1** - Define what sort of web application architecture you want to follow or use. This will be based on your project and business requirements. From what information I have so far I would suggest a simple client-server architecture where your frontend or web-application is the client which makes REST API calls to the backend (API Server) and thus produces a meaningful result.\r\n\r\n**Step 2** - Start with the creation of 2 projects a frontend where your HTML, CSS JS, etc will be and a simple NodeJS script to serve this static web app when deployed on the server. I am going with NodeJS since the context of this question is suggesting the same.\r\n\r\n**Step 3** - The other project which will only be an API Server or Backend. This server will provide only REST API to the frontend. This server will talk to the database and provide other services like authentication and logging etc. You can use expressJS for this also in the frontend project.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a simplistic representation of the client-server model which you can reference.\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome additional links for you to digest.\r\n\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/715063/what-is-the-difference-between-a-web-application-and-a-client-server-application\r\n\r\nhttps://medium.com/codiumclub/web-application-architecture-part-1-guide-to-become-full-stack-developer-cc9526a3519b\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/hoSxM.jpg","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58496937/how-can-i-convert-a-html-template-into-a-node-js-web-app/58498490#58498490","title":"How can I convert a HTML template into a Node.JS web app"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12152171,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51e37fa03ff7e3d297cde5548cf27cde?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Kronos1979","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12152171/kronos1979"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571726779,"creation_date":1571717225,"question_id":58496937,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58496937","body_markdown":"I&#39;m starting out on my Node.JS journey and I discovered a fantastic boilerplate over at https://github.com/azouaoui-med/pro-sidebar-template.

Even having `pop()` return the top object by value is highly problematic. In particular, if the copy constructor for the stored type can throw, it&#39;s pretty much a disaster waiting to happen--if the copy constructor throws as its trying to copy the return value, the situation is basically unrecoverable. The value has already been removed from the stack, but it isn&#39;t being returned to the caller, so it&#39;s completely lost.\r\n\r\nThe standard library gets around this by not having pop return anything. So, you pop an item from the stack in two steps: first you use `top()` to get the top item on the stack, then you use `pop()` to just remove the item on top of the stack:\r\n\r\n    auto top_item = your_stack.top();\r\n    your_stack.pop();\r\n\r\nIf the copy constructor throws as you&#39;re trying to retrieve the top-of-stack item, then the `your_stack.pop()` won&#39;t execute, so the stack hasn&#39;t been affected--the top item remains there. The `pop()` only executes if you&#39;ve already successfully retrieved the top item into `top_item`.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this is a little clumsy to use.\r\n\r\nEven more unfortunately, since we&#39;re using two steps to pop the top item, it&#39;s essentially impossible to make this thread-safe--for that, you just about have to ensure that retrieving the item and removing it from the stack are a single atomic operation--either both of them happen without anything else interfering, or else neither one happens at all.\r\n\r\nThere is a design that meets that requirement, and (at least arguably) isn&#39;t quite as clumsy to use:\r\n\r\n    void pop(T &amp;t) { \r\n        t = storage.back();\r\n        storage.pop_back();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMuch like the previous example using the standard stack, if the `t=storage.back();` line throws an exception, then the `storage.pop_back();` simply won&#39;t execute--you haven&#39;t retrieved an item, but the items on the stack remain undisturbed.\r\n\r\nFor a simple concurrent stack, you could add a mutex and change the return type to `bool`, indicating whether the operation succeeded or not (again, you can&#39;t follow the typical single-threaded pattern of &quot;if (!stack.empty()) stack.pop()`, since you&#39;re back to using two separate operations, so even if you find a non-empty stack, by the time you try to pop it, some other thread may have already done so, and your attempt at popping will fail.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58496927/how-to-return-a-reference-of-the-top-object-in-a-stack-c/58498819#58498819","title":"How to return a reference of the top object in a stack c++"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":9348960,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d4dd6a3cd95c4ab596f3f193492b2747?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"David","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9348960/david"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571728087,"creation_date":1571717043,"question_id":58496927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58496927","body_markdown":"I am attempting to create a peek()/top() function for my Stack class using templates, and have this issue where I am unsure of how to return the topmost object of the stack.

I am working with an API that defines a function similar to the following:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction foo(a: number): number | undefined;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to perform a function on the return value of this number to safely convert it to a number always, but I get an error:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction myFunc(bar: number | undefined): number {\r\n  if (typeof bar === undefined) {\r\n    return 0;\r\n  } else {\r\n    return bar; // error ts(2322)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `ts(2322)` expands to `Type &#39;number | undefined&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;number&#39;.\r\n  Type &#39;undefined&#39; is not assignable to type &#39;number&#39;.`\r\n\r\nI feel like this is something that should be determinable at compile time. Clearly, we only go into the else if `typeof bar === number`, but trying that in this code snippet:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nfunction myFunc(bar: number | undefined): number {\r\n  if (typeof bar === number) { // error ts(2367)\r\n    return bar;\r\n  } else {\r\n    return 0;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error message is `This condition will always return &#39;false&#39; since the types &#39;&quot;string&quot; | &quot;number&quot; | &quot;bigint&quot; | &quot;boolean&quot; | &quot;symbol&quot; | &quot;undefined&quot; | &quot;object&quot; | &quot;function&quot;&#39; and &#39;Requireable&lt;number&gt;&#39; have no overlap.`\r\n\r\nAt this point I&#39;m pretty lost on what&#39;s possible with casting in TypeScript. Is there a way to accomplish my goals?
