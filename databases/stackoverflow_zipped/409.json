the below is what has worked for me so far, I&#39;m able to run the command &quot;show mac address-table&quot;, take that output and put it into a text file, search line by line through the output for 000c.15 and use that line for further output later down the road. I think the important thing was to decode the output(bytes) into a string before writing it to the text file. Also, using the seek(0) function was helpful for taking me back to the beginning of the txt file before starting to read. Line.strip seems to get rid of all the white space being interpreted as lines. not 100% sure on that last one. Still having issues with getting that code to send the command but i&#39;m making progress at least.

An enum in Java is not of type `String`.\r\n\r\nWhen you call `e.name()`, **you get a `String`** rather than an enum object. You pass that as the key to your map. So you have a map of strings to `randomstuff`, not a map of enum to `randomstuff`.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s get concrete with a realistic example. Here we map an enum object of [`java.time.DayOfWeek`][1] to a `Person` object whose class we define elsewhere. The idea here is that for the upcoming week we assign a particular person to each day&#39;s work shift. \r\n\r\nDefine our three workers.\r\n\r\n    Person alice = new Person( &quot;Alice&quot; );\r\n    Person bob = new Person( &quot;Bob&quot; );\r\n    Person carol = new Person( &quot;Carol&quot; );\r\n\r\nDefine a [`Map`][2] of each day to a person. \r\n\r\n    Map &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; workWeek = new EnumMap &lt;&gt;( DayOfWeek.class );\r\n\r\nNotice in the code above that we use the [`EnumMap`][3] class. This class is highly optimized to work with enum objects, running very fast while taking up very little memory. If your key is an enum, always use `EnumMap` rather than `HashMap`. \r\n\r\nHere is a reminder of the various `Map` implementations bundled with Java 11.\r\n\r\n[![Java map to Maps.png][4]][4]\r\n\r\nAssign a person for each day of the week.\r\n\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.MONDAY , bob );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.TUESDAY , carol );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY , carol );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.THURSDAY , alice );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.FRIDAY , alice );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.SATURDAY , bob );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.SUNDAY , alice );\r\n\r\nDump to console.\r\n\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;workweek: &quot; + workWeek );\r\n\r\n&gt;workweek: {MONDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, TUESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, WEDNESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, THURSDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }, FRIDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }, SATURDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, SUNDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }}\r\n\r\nNotice how nowhere in our mapping did we use a `String`. We never said `&quot;Monday&quot;` nor `&quot;monday&quot;`. We never called `DayOfWeek.MONDAY.name()`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you do need some text to represent the day-of-week, do not call `.name`. To automatically localize, call [`DayOfWeek::getDisplayName`][5]. When writing your own enums, I suggest you too add something like a `getDisplayName` method (even if for only a single language). \r\n\r\nThe [`Enum::name`][6] method really should *not* be called in most situations. The main point of inventing the sophisticated enum facility in Java is to *not* depend on such mere strings (or mere integers) that tend to make our code brittle and difficult to read/debug.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/EnumMap.html\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4k7X7.png\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html#getDisplayName(java.time.format.TextStyle,java.util.Locale)\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Enum.html#name()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441679/how-come-enum-behaves-differently-in-different-locations/58443105#58443105","title":"How come ENUM behaves differently in different locations?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"last_editor":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571366474,"last_edit_date":1571366474,"creation_date":1571366134,"answer_id":58443169,"question_id":58441679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443169","body_markdown":"The [javadoc][1] for `Map` show the signatures for `put` and `get` as:\r\n\r\n    V put(K key, V value)\r\n\r\n    V get(Object key)\r\n\r\nNote that the types of the `key` argument are inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWhy are they inconsistent?\r\n\r\nI think that the answer is for backwards compatibility with the pre-generic version of the `List` API.

am trying to find a list of words that are hidden in a digit soup. \r\nFirstly, i am trying to find words that are divided by digits into at least 5 groups. \r\nFor example:

9**car**0**dio**752901403085**vascular**93\r\n\r\n-All the letters are lowercase\r\n\r\n-There is no space in the text\r\n\r\nI only have the soup as a text file.

My first instinct was to try to use the grep command, but i don&#39;t see how i can get the words with grep without knowing anything about the words themselves.

Instead, you probably want a `ForeignKey` relationship between `Place` and the `Bar` model, since a *place* (eg San Fransisco) can have many bars, but a bar can only have *one place*.\r\n    \r\nUpdate\r\n-\r\nFrom my understanding of your comments, this is what I would suggest:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    class PlaceMixin(models.Model):\r\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        longitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        latitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\n        class Meta:\r\n            abstract = True\r\n        \r\n        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n            latitude = self.latitude\r\n            longitude = self.longitude\r\n            do_stuff(latitude, longitude)\r\n            super().save()\r\n\r\n    class Location(PlaceMixin):\r\n        country = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        region = models.CharField(max_length=1000, choices=REGION, null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\n    class Bar(PlaceMixin):\r\n        location = models.ForeignKey(Location, related_name=&#39;bars&#39;, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\n    class Store(PlaceMixin):\r\n        location = models.ForeignKey(Location, related_name=&#39;stores&#39;, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\nNow you can access both the lat/long of the `Place`, and of the `Location`:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;location = Location.objects.create(name=&#39;San Fransisco&#39;, latitude=1, longitude=1)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar = Bar.objects.create(name=&#39;Blackbird&#39;, latitude=2, longitude=2, location=location)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar.latitude\r\n    2\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar.location.latitude\r\n    1\r\n\r\nTo query all bars in San Fransisco:\r\n\r\n    location = Location.objects.select_related(&#39;Bar&#39;).get(name=&#39;San Fransisco&#39;)\r\n    bars = location.bars.all()\r\n    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441674/link-to-child-to-parent-in-django-model/58441887#58441887","title":"Link to child to parent in Django model"}],"owner":{"reputation":350,"user_id":5222301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2315939e0879da3f8f0eeb57e80f8ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5222301/h-c"},"last_editor":{"reputation":350,"user_id":5222301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2315939e0879da3f8f0eeb57e80f8ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5222301/h-c"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58441887,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571362583,"creation_date":1571352628,"last_edit_date":1571353583,"question_id":58441674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441674","body_markdown":"I have a Place Model:\r\n\r\n    class Place(models.Model):\r\n    \tname = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tcountry = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tpostal_code = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tregion = models.CharField(max_length=1000, choices=REGION, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tlongitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tlatitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \r\n    \tdate_created = models.DateTimeField(_(&#39;date created&#39;), default=timezone.now)\r\n    \tdate_modified = models.DateTimeField(_(&#39;date_modified&#39;), auto_now=True)\r\n\r\nOriginally I create place to save information about a city, like San Francisco or New York.\r\n\r\nNow I want to create a new model called Bar:\r\n\r\n    class Bar(Place):\r\n    \tlocation = models.OneToOneField(Place, verbose_name=_(&#39;location&#39;), related_name=&#39;bar&#39;, blank=True, on_delete=models.PROTECT, parent_link=True)\r\n    \tdate_inception = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tdate_closed = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\nI would like to link the bar to a particular city in the Place model.

Workaround\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t think of an automated way to do this, but if you absolutely must achieve this, then a hacky way to do it is:\r\n\r\n1. Remove only the package(s) you want:\r\n\r\n        conda remove --force libtiff\r\n\r\n2. Trigger a consistency check to get a list of now broken packages:\r\n\r\n        conda install -d python\r\n\r\n3.

How can I avoid this problem?\r\n\r\nMy expected behaviour would be that ```conda remove seaborn``` removes ```seaborn``` and all of its dependencies, but does *not* remove any package (or dependencies thereof) that was explicitly installed before or after ```seaborn```. Some might say just uninstall ```seaborn``` and all 39 packages, and then manually reinstall ```matplotlib``` and ```pandas```. This works in trivial cases, but once there are e.g. 25 packages with complex interdependencies, this becomes very complicated, and at the very least a complete nuisance to maintain.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example of this, how can I construct a full Anaconda environment minus a particular package and *only* the packages that depend on it? I tried:\r\n\r\n    conda create -n test python=3.6 anaconda\r\n    conda remove libtiff  # I want this to strictly only remove libtiff and its recursive dependents, but obviously this is not what happens\r\n\r\nbut the second line removes essentially every single package in the entire environment as it removes ```anaconda```. Any ideas?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441645/conda-remove-uninstalls-more-packages-than-expected","title":"Conda remove uninstalls more packages than expected"},{"tags":["reactjs","create-react-app","postcss","autoprefixer"],"owner":{"reputation":5364,"user_id":1611058,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1VDs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Tonon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1611058/daniel-tonon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571352322,"creation_date":1571352322,"question_id":58441642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441642","body_markdown":"I am trying to enable Autoprefixer Grid translations in a Create React App application.\r\n\r\n**I do not want to eject**.\r\n\r\nIs it still possible to enable grid translations without ejecting?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441642/how-do-you-enable-autoprefixer-css-grid-translations-in-create-react-app","title":"How do you enable Autoprefixer CSS Grid translations in create-react-app?"},{"tags":["java","user-interface","javafx","fxml","fxmlloader"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":184,"user_id":1836168,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebcd2f66ed1c5298cf9300706afe2a62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peeyush","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836168/peeyush"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352797,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103222875,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103222875_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":15457,"user_id":6395627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dac5493d339ba8cb379f4efb2485d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Slaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6395627/slaw"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571355454,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103223402,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103223402_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":26626,"user_id":1831987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38b1c37530189ec4471a43a618e33f67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VGR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1831987/vgr"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571368103,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103225851,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103225851_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":1450,"user_id":2475470,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7b9b1aacdc6bbc9d7fba048300c0dee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Grendel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2475470/grendel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571385880,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103231223,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103231223_58441638"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11239910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ee4A9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Žeka Koževin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11239910/%c5%bdeka-ko%c5%beevin"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571410407,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571352274,"creation_date":1571352274,"question_id":58441638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441638","body_markdown":"could you, please, explain what does this construction `getClass().getResource(&quot;...&quot;)` mean.

Instead you write to std::cout. So, you do not store the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you are calling new but never delete. With that you are creating a memory leak.\r\n\r\nThen, you still thinking to much in C. You should not use ````new```` or plain C-Style arrays.

Main problem, I think you are not initializing your arrays properly\r\n    1. Try using `Array.fill` or `Array.tabulate` to create and initialize arrays\r\n```\r\n  val rand = scala.util.Random\r\n  var x = Array.fill(parameter1)(rand.nextInt(100))\r\n  var y = Array.fill(parameter2)(rand.nextInt(100))\r\n```\r\n 1. You don&#39;t need the `.asUInt` in the `poke`, it accepts `Int`s or `BigInt`s\r\n 1. When defining hardware constants, use `.U` instead of `.asUInt`, the latter is a way of casting other chisel types, it does work but it a backward compatibility thing.\r\n 1. It&#39;s better to not start variables or methods with capital letters\r\n 1. I suggest us `class DutName(val parameter1: Int, val parameter2: Int)` or `class DutName(val parameter1: Int)(val parameter2: Int)` if you prefer.\r\n   1. This will allow to use the dut&#39;s paremeters when you are writing your test.\r\n   1. E.g. `for(i &lt;- 0 until dut.parameter1){poke(dut.io.IP2(i), x(i))}`\r\n   1.

I need to create a Whatsapp like message view, and to achieve that, I used a GridView component as a base. However, in order to draw the messages correctly, I need to create each GridView row with a different height, depending on the message text.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise, I could not find any solution on the internet to achieve that, although I thought it was a simple formality. I tried a solution by myself, which I attached below, however it doesn&#39;t work. The issue is that all the rows take the height of the last resized one.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Qt can do this, unfortunately, I have been looking for days now, and I can not find a solution to this issue. I simply have no idea about how to achieve that. So someone can explain to me how to create a GridView with variable height rows, or if the GridWiew isn&#39;t the appropriate component to do that, whcih I should use instead?\r\n\r\nHere is my qss file:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import QtQuick 2.12\r\n    import QtQuick.Controls 2.5\r\n    import QtQuick.Window 2.12\r\n    import QtQuick.Layouts 1.11\r\n    \r\n    Window\r\n    {\r\n        visible: true\r\n        width: 640\r\n        height: 480\r\n        title: qsTr(&quot;Grid view&quot;)\r\n        color: &quot;#ffffff&quot;\r\n    \r\n        ColumnLayout\r\n        {\r\n            transformOrigin: Item.Center\r\n            spacing: 0\r\n            x: 0\r\n            y: 0\r\n            width: parent.width\r\n            height: parent.height\r\n    \r\n            /**\r\n            * Grid view item\r\n            */\r\n            Component\r\n            {\r\n                id: itGridItem\r\n    \r\n                Item\r\n                {\r\n                    Column\r\n                    {\r\n                        Rectangle\r\n                        {\r\n                            property int messageWidth: (gvMessageGrid.cellWidth / 2) - 50\r\n    \r\n                            id: itemRect\r\n                            x: senderIsMyself ? 25 : gvMessageGrid.cellWidth - (25 + messageWidth)\r\n                            y: 5\r\n                            width: messageWidth\r\n                            height: itemTextID.height + 20\r\n                            color: senderIsMyself ? &quot;#d5d5d5&quot; : &quot;#800b940e&quot;\r\n                            radius: 5\r\n                            clip: true\r\n    \r\n                            Text\r\n                            {\r\n                                id: itemTextID\r\n                                width: parent.width - 20\r\n                                text: itemText\r\n                                renderType: Text.NativeRendering\r\n                                textFormat: TextEdit.RichText\r\n                                wrapMode: Text.WordWrap\r\n                                font.family: &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;\r\n                                font.pixelSize: 18\r\n                                anchors.margins: 10\r\n                                anchors.left: parent.left\r\n                                anchors.top: parent.top\r\n                                color: &quot;#101010&quot;\r\n                            }\r\n    \r\n                            onHeightChanged: gvMessageGrid.cellHeight = height + 10\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            /**\r\n            * Messages grid view\r\n            */\r\n            GridView\r\n            {\r\n                id: gvMessageGrid\r\n                y: 0\r\n                Layout.fillHeight: true\r\n                flickableDirection: Flickable.VerticalFlick\r\n                Layout.fillWidth: true\r\n                Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignHCenter | Qt.AlignVCenter\r\n                clip: true\r\n                contentWidth: 700\r\n                contentHeight: 300\r\n                cellWidth: contentWidth\r\n                cellHeight: 150\r\n                model: lmGridModel\r\n                delegate: itGridItem\r\n    \r\n                ScrollBar.vertical: ScrollBar\r\n                {\r\n                    visible: true\r\n                }\r\n    \r\n                onWidthChanged: cellWidth = width\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**--- Edited on October 18, 2019**\r\n\r\nFollowing the eyllanesc suggestion below, here are 2 screenshots of what I want and what I get:\r\n\r\n**what I want**\r\n_______________________________________\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n**what I get**\r\n_______________________________________\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE** I&#39;m using several languages, for test purposes, because my application must have international support.

Thanks in advance to those who can help me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441559/how-to-make-webview-open-last-accessed-url","title":"How to make WebView open last accessed url"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","unicode","icons","hamburger-menu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352135,"post_id":58441557,"comment_id":103222735,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms#comment103222735_58441557"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571371260,"post_id":58441557,"comment_id":103226395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms#comment103226395_58441557"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571373067,"post_id":58442216,"comment_id":103226763,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms/58442216#comment103226763_58442216"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":557,"user_id":9541862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44fe5271e65a59c7c1be5a45b618b078?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"quaabaam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9541862/quaabaam"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571357005,"creation_date":1571357005,"answer_id":58442216,"question_id":58441557,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58442216","body_markdown":"You can set the button text to the Unicode value in code like so...\r\n\r\n    button1.Text = char.ConvertFromUtf32(&#39;\\u2630&#39;); // &quot;☰&quot;;\r\n\r\nOr you can paste the symbol in the button&#39;s Text property in the designer properties list.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms/58442216#58442216","title":"Using hamburger menu symbol/icon by its unicode in C# Winforms"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58442216,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571357005,"creation_date":1571351645,"question_id":58441557,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441557","body_markdown":"I am trying to display a hamburger menu symbol/icon in a button control in Winforms C# using the symbol&#39;s unicode.

We run many services (utilizing TCP) that stream large amounts of data throughout these networks. We have written software which interacts with OpenDaylight to route this data, and it works just fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, if any UDP traffic is streamed through the network, OpenDaylight begins having issues and can no longer detect links between any of the switches. When the network is viewed through a GUI application (like DLUX, [the Cisco OpenFlow App][1], etc.), all of the switches appear disconnected after using UDP, and we can no longer route traffic through the network. Even when shutting down our custom routing software and attempting to do small iperf3 UDP tests, all of the links between the switches disappear. When doing iperf3 TCP tests, the network behaves normally.\r\n\r\nThe features we are using are minimal (```l2switch, openflowplugin, ovsdb, mdsal, and yangtools```). \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience with this problem? What are some solutions and ways I can dig into this and find out what is going wrong? \r\n\r\nAlso, is there any way in OpenDaylight or Open vSwitch where I can investigate links that have gone down? And is there any way I can bring them back up?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/OpenDaylight-Openflow-App","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441544/opendaylight-openvswitch-and-udp-traffic-issue","title":"OpenDaylight, OpenVSwitch, and UDP traffic issue"},{"tags":["java","intellij-idea","junit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":301057,"user_id":104891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ff652685122f4500dd4f3c21fb32da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CrazyCoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104891/crazycoder"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352885,"post_id":58441543,"comment_id":103222898,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441543/intellij-suddenly-is-no-longer-able-to-find-junit-even-though-the-editor-recogni#comment103222898_58441543"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10736997,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef7b5826881f55fc093463ebfc8d2c65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mattreex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10736997/mattreex"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571351539,"creation_date":1571351539,"question_id":58441543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441543","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know why intellij is failing when I try to run these tests.

You expectation is correct.\r\n\r\nI do not think it has anything to do with lock, however. lock will only prevent a read and a write from happening at the same time, not produce this behavior. Try it without the lock to verify. (However due to things like the JiT Compiler, CPU cache invalidations and Optimisations, results may still differet if there is a lock, even if it has no direct effect).\r\n\r\nMy best bet is that the read thread is simply so slow, it does not finish *once* before the write is through all it&#39;s itteartions. Writing the UI is expensive, even on something as trivial as the console. Or even especially there. I do a lot of backups of userprofiles using robocopy. And if it hits a lot of very small files, just writing the Console becomes the *actuall programm bottleneck*, ever over *disk access*. And something out-bottlenecking disk acess is not something that happens often.\r\n\r\nIf you write the UI only once per user triggerd event, you will not notice the cost. But do it from any form of loop - especially one running in another thread - and you will start to notice it. I was particualry informed that a foreach is apparently half as slow at ittearting as a for loop.\r\n\r\nI even made a example for this, albeit in a Windows Forms Environment:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Windows.Forms;\r\n    \r\n    namespace UIWriteOverhead\r\n    {\r\n        public partial class Form1 : Form\r\n        {\r\n            public Form1()\r\n            {\r\n                InitializeComponent();\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            int[] getNumbers(int upperLimit)\r\n            {\r\n                int[] ReturnValue = new int[upperLimit];\r\n    \r\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; ReturnValue.Length; i++)\r\n                    ReturnValue[i] = i;\r\n    \r\n                return ReturnValue;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            void printWithBuffer(int[] Values)\r\n            {\r\n                textBox1.Text = &quot;&quot;;\r\n                string buffer = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n                foreach (int Number in Values)\r\n                    buffer += Number.ToString() + Environment.NewLine;\r\n                textBox1.Text = buffer;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            void printDirectly(int[] Values){\r\n                textBox1.Text = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n                foreach (int Number in Values)\r\n                    textBox1.Text += Number.ToString() + Environment.NewLine;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            private void btnPrintBuffer_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Generating Numbers&quot;);\r\n                int[] temp = getNumbers(10000);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing with buffer&quot;);\r\n                printWithBuffer(temp);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing done&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            private void btnPrintDirect_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Generating Numbers&quot;);\r\n                int[] temp = getNumbers(1000);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing directly&quot;);\r\n                printDirectly(temp);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing done&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut even this overhead is pretty unlikey to have a presistent result. At some time the read thread should get the lock first, blocking write. But still, there are too many variables to say for sure. You should propably try a simpler example, with more consistent (and a whole lot less) writework. What about writing &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to the console, instead of complex stuff like this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441539/why-lock-statement-doesnt-work-as-expected/58441653#58441653","title":"Why Lock statement doesn&#39;t work as expected"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12235422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAoWlJKcneZTCg4YdJoKq9-zKtffxgRPB02QED1=k-s128","display_name":"Stepan Penyaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12235422/stepan-penyaz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12235422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAoWlJKcneZTCg4YdJoKq9-zKtffxgRPB02QED1=k-s128","display_name":"Stepan Penyaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12235422/stepan-penyaz"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58441653,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571383561,"creation_date":1571351495,"last_edit_date":1571383561,"question_id":58441539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441539","body_markdown":"    static List&lt;int&gt; sharedCollection = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    static readonly Object obj = new Object();\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)`enter code here`\r\n    {\r\n      var writeThread = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n      {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n        {\r\n          lock (obj)\r\n          {\r\n            Write();\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      var readThread = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n      {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n        {\r\n          lock (obj)\r\n          {\r\n            Read();\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      writeThread.Start();\r\n      readThread.Start();\r\n\r\n      Console.ReadLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Read()\r\n    {\r\n      Console.Write(&quot;Current collection state:  &quot;);\r\n      sharedCollection.ForEach((e) =&gt; Console.Write($&quot;{e}  &quot;));\r\n      Console.WriteLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Write()\r\n    {\r\n      Random generator = new Random();\r\n      var addedValue = generator.Next(1, 20);\r\n      sharedCollection.Add(addedValue);\r\n      Console.WriteLine($&quot;Added value is: {addedValue}&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time trying to understand why I receive this:\r\n[console result][1]\r\n\r\nCould someone explain to me what is wrong with this code?\r\n\r\nMutex works fine but I need to illustrate lock statement too...\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jpvXV.jpg\r\n\r\nI expect that after every adding in 1st thread I obtain a collection state from the 2nd thread.

reason why the output gives you 30 days is because...\r\n\r\nThe function &quot;days_in_month&quot; is supposed to return an integer but you are not returning one explicitly.The function, thus, defaults to returning an integer implicitly but it is not what is expected, this causes the `if(days_in_month(month, year) == 31)` condition to fail each time and the code prints the text in the `else` block.\r\n\r\nApart from this, there are other inaccuracies in the code:\r\n\r\n 1. The &quot;month&quot; parameter passed to the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function\r\n   is not utilized anywhere within the function.\r\n 2. In the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function, you are checking for equality\r\n    for `num_days`(ex: `num_days== 31`). This should instead be\r\n    `num_days = 31`.\r\n 3. In the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function the `else(month_given== 2);`\r\n    is not correct.&quot;else&quot; is the default case and should be followed by\r\n    a statement. It does not check conditions.\r\n 4. The `while` statement should also check for input greater than 12.\r\n    Like so `while(month != 0 &amp;&amp; month &lt; 13)`\r\n 5. Lastly, there is a logical flaw in the placement of the &quot;else&quot;\r\n        clause in the &quot;main&quot; function.Please note that &quot;else&quot; handles the\r\n        &quot;none of the above&quot; condition.By placing the &quot;else&quot; in between two\r\n        &quot;if&quot;s, if the first &quot;if&quot; fails, the &quot;else&quot; is guaranteed to execute even before the second &quot;if&quot; is tested.\r\n\r\nImplementing the corrections would result is a working code(listed below)....but there is scope for improvement.\r\n\r\n1.The variable &quot;year&quot; is declared but not utilized anywhere.You should \r\n   collect input for this variable and implement a condition to display \r\n   the correct days for February depending on whether the year is a   \r\n   leap year or not.Preferably in &quot;main&quot;.\r\n\r\n2.You could call &quot;days_in_month&quot; just once and check the returned value\r\n   with the conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n

For instance, you may state that at some point the number of processes (see **[_nr_pr][1]**) that are in execution becomes equal to `0` (or more, if you admit *some* infinite loops), or check that a particular process terminates correctly using [remote references][2].\r\n\r\nBoth cases are contained in the following example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c++ --&gt;\r\n\r\n    byte x = 0; byte y = 0;\r\n    active proctype toggle() {\r\n        do\r\n        :: x == 1 -&gt; x = 0\r\n        :: x == 0 -&gt; x = 1\r\n        od;\r\n    end:\r\n    }\r\n    init {\r\n        (y == 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // sooner or later, the process toggle\r\n    // with _pid == 0 will reach the end\r\n    // state\r\n    ltl p1 { &lt;&gt; toggle[0]@end };\r\n\r\n    // sooner or later, the number of processes\r\n    // that are currently running becomes 0,\r\n    // (hence, there can be no infinite loops)\r\n    ltl p2 { &lt;&gt; (_nr_pr == 0) };\r\n\r\nBoth the first\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ~$ spin -a -search -ltl p1 test.pml\r\n    ~$ spin -t test.pml\r\n    ltl p1: &lt;&gt; ((toggle[0]@end))\r\n    ltl p2: &lt;&gt; ((_nr_pr==0))\r\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;START OF CYCLE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    Never claim moves to line 4\t[(!((toggle[0]._p==end)))]\r\n    spin: trail ends after 8 steps\r\n    #processes: 2\r\n    \t\tx = 0\r\n    \t\ty = 0\r\n    \t\tend = 0\r\n      8:\tproc  1 (:init::1) test.pml:10 (state 1)\r\n      8:\tproc  0 (toggle:1) test.pml:3 (state 5)\r\n      8:\tproc  - (p1:1) _spin_nvr.tmp:3 (state 3)\r\n    2 processes created\r\n\r\nand the second\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n    \r\n    ~$ spin -a -search -ltl p2 test.pml\r\n    ~$ spin -t test.pml\r\n    ltl p1: &lt;&gt; ((toggle[0]@end))\r\n    ltl p2: &lt;&gt; ((_nr_pr==0))\r\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;START OF CYCLE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    Never claim moves to line 11\t[(!((_nr_pr==0)))]\r\n    spin: trail ends after 8 steps\r\n    #processes: 2\r\n    \t\tx = 0\r\n    \t\ty = 0\r\n    \t\tend = 0\r\n      8:\tproc  1 (:init::1) test.pml:10 (state 1)\r\n      8:\tproc  0 (toggle:1) test.pml:3 (state 5)\r\n      8:\tproc  - (p2:1) _spin_nvr.tmp:10 (state 3)\r\n    2 processes created\r\n\r\n\r\nLTL properties are found to be false.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; Regarding the &#39;unreached in proctype&#39; messages, adding an end label to the do loop doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.\r\n\r\nThe `end` label(s) are used to **remove** the *&quot;invalid end state&quot;* **error** that would be otherwise be found. \r\n\r\nFor example, modifying your previous example as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c++ --&gt;\r\n\r\n    byte x = 0; byte y = 0;\r\n    active proctype toggle() {\r\n        skip;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    init {\r\n    end:\r\n        (y == 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMakes the error go away:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ~$ spin -a -search test.pml\r\n    (Spin Version 6.5.0 -- 17 July 2019)\r\n    ...\r\n    State-vector 20 byte, depth reached 1, errors: 0\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nOne should only ever use an [**end**][4] label when one is willing to **guarantee** that a process being stuck with no executable instruction is not a symptom of an undesired deadlock situation.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/_nr_pr.html\r\n  [2]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/remoterefs.html\r\n  [3]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/progress.html\r\n  [4]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/end.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441532/why-an-infinite-loop-doesnt-result-in-an-error-in-model-checking-with-promela-a/58446872#58446872","title":"Why an infinite loop doesn&#39;t result in an error in model checking with Promela and Spin?"}],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":6553631,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a382e5eed46ae9d3558510513079c683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tgonzaleza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553631/tgonzaleza"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5541,"user_id":6024122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uiRWa4coXLs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJUs/5BxfhSS1bUY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Patrick Trentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6024122/patrick-trentin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58446872,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571388285,"creation_date":1571351464,"last_edit_date":1571388123,"question_id":58441532,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441532","body_markdown":"If I write the following code in Promela and run it in Spin in verifier mode it ends with 0 errors.

currently have a script that will combine multiple csv files into one, the script works fine except that we run out of ram really quickly when larger files start being used. This is an issue for one reason, the script runs on an AWS server and running out of RAM means a server crash.\r\nCurrently the file size limit is around 250mb each, and that limits us to 2 files, however as the company I work is in Biotech and we&#39;re using Genetic Sequencing files, the files we use can range in size from 17mb up to around 700mb depending on the experiment. My idea has been to load one dataframe into memory whole and then chunk the others and combine iteratively, this didn&#39;t work so well.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dataframes are similar to this (they can vary in size, but some columns remain the same; &quot;Mod&quot;, &quot;AA&quot; and &quot;Nuc&quot;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen combining the two frames I need them to merge on &quot;Mod&quot;, &quot;Nuc&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; so that I have something similar to this \r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 | 2_1 | 2_2 | 2_3 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   | 5   | 29  | 0   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already have code to change the names of the headers so I&#39;m not worried about that, however when I use chunks I end up with something closer to \r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 | 2_1 | 2_2 | 2_3 | 3_1 | 3_2 | 3_3 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   | 5   | 29  | 0   | NA  | NA  | NA  |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   | NA  | NA  | NA  | 0   | 0   | 1   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nbasically it treats each chunk as if it were a new file and not from the same one. \r\n\r\nI know why its doing that but I&#39;m not sure on how to fix this, right now my code for chunking is really simple.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    file = &quot;tableFile/123456.txt&quot;\r\n    initDF = pd.read_csv(file, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, header=0)\r\n    file2 = &quot;tableFile/7891011.txt&quot;\r\n    for chunks in pd.read_csv(file2, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, chunksize=50000, header=0):\r\n        initDF = initDF.merge(chunks, how=&#39;right&#39;, on=[&#39;Mod&#39;, &quot;Nuc&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;])\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can see its pretty bare bones, as I said I know why its doing what its doing but I&#39;m not experienced with Pandas nor with dataframe joins to be able to fix it so any help would be much appreciated.

you just want them to invoke the Lambda cross account, which was your original question, then you can [delegate access][1] to an IAM user (or all users) in the other AWS account so that they can assume a role in your account and invoke the Lambda function in your account.\r\n\r\nTechnically, you could just add IAM users to your account and give them credentials, but that is not a best practice. Cross-account roles are preferred.\r\n\r\nBut is this really what you want? It would not allow them, for example, to update the Lambda function. You need to think about what their responsibilities will be. If they are going to maintain the Lambda function then it&#39;s more likely that they should deploy the Lambda function into their account and you give their Lambda function cross-account access to whichever resources it needs in your AWS account.\r\n\r\nIf you want to share development then use a shared code repo (like GitHub or CodeCommit) and create a process, automated or otherwise, for packaging and uploading the Lambda function to your account. Again, they may need to be able to assume a cross-account IAM role in order to update and/or invoke your Lambda function.\r\n\r\nAt a higher level, if what you’re building here is actually a serverless application with an API, then consider using the serverless framework or AWS SAM, with API Gateway, for development, packaging, and deployment.\r\n\r\nOn your question about account structure, this is taking us far from the original question, so I&#39;d recommend further reading, for example [here][2] and [here][3].

the below is what has worked for me so far, I&#39;m able to run the command &quot;show mac address-table&quot;, take that output and put it into a text file, search line by line through the output for 000c.15 and use that line for further output later down the road. I think the important thing was to decode the output(bytes) into a string before writing it to the text file. Also, using the seek(0) function was helpful for taking me back to the beginning of the txt file before starting to read. Line.strip seems to get rid of all the white space being interpreted as lines. not 100% sure on that last one. Still having issues with getting that code to send the command but i&#39;m making progress at least.

An enum in Java is not of type `String`.\r\n\r\nWhen you call `e.name()`, **you get a `String`** rather than an enum object. You pass that as the key to your map. So you have a map of strings to `randomstuff`, not a map of enum to `randomstuff`.\r\n\r\nLet&#39;s get concrete with a realistic example. Here we map an enum object of [`java.time.DayOfWeek`][1] to a `Person` object whose class we define elsewhere. The idea here is that for the upcoming week we assign a particular person to each day&#39;s work shift. \r\n\r\nDefine our three workers.\r\n\r\n    Person alice = new Person( &quot;Alice&quot; );\r\n    Person bob = new Person( &quot;Bob&quot; );\r\n    Person carol = new Person( &quot;Carol&quot; );\r\n\r\nDefine a [`Map`][2] of each day to a person. \r\n\r\n    Map &lt; DayOfWeek, Person &gt; workWeek = new EnumMap &lt;&gt;( DayOfWeek.class );\r\n\r\nNotice in the code above that we use the [`EnumMap`][3] class. This class is highly optimized to work with enum objects, running very fast while taking up very little memory. If your key is an enum, always use `EnumMap` rather than `HashMap`. \r\n\r\nHere is a reminder of the various `Map` implementations bundled with Java 11.\r\n\r\n[![Java map to Maps.png][4]][4]\r\n\r\nAssign a person for each day of the week.\r\n\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.MONDAY , bob );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.TUESDAY , carol );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.WEDNESDAY , carol );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.THURSDAY , alice );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.FRIDAY , alice );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.SATURDAY , bob );\r\n    workWeek.put( DayOfWeek.SUNDAY , alice );\r\n\r\nDump to console.\r\n\r\n    System.out.println( &quot;workweek: &quot; + workWeek );\r\n\r\n&gt;workweek: {MONDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, TUESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, WEDNESDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Carol&#39; }, THURSDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }, FRIDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }, SATURDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Bob&#39; }, SUNDAY=Person{ name=&#39;Alice&#39; }}\r\n\r\nNotice how nowhere in our mapping did we use a `String`. We never said `&quot;Monday&quot;` nor `&quot;monday&quot;`. We never called `DayOfWeek.MONDAY.name()`.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if you do need some text to represent the day-of-week, do not call `.name`. To automatically localize, call [`DayOfWeek::getDisplayName`][5]. When writing your own enums, I suggest you too add something like a `getDisplayName` method (even if for only a single language). \r\n\r\nThe [`Enum::name`][6] method really should *not* be called in most situations. The main point of inventing the sophisticated enum facility in Java is to *not* depend on such mere strings (or mere integers) that tend to make our code brittle and difficult to read/debug.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html\r\n  [2]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Map.html\r\n  [3]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/EnumMap.html\r\n  [4]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/4k7X7.png\r\n  [5]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/time/DayOfWeek.html#getDisplayName(java.time.format.TextStyle,java.util.Locale)\r\n  [6]: https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Enum.html#name()","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441679/how-come-enum-behaves-differently-in-different-locations/58443105#58443105","title":"How come ENUM behaves differently in different locations?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"last_editor":{"reputation":552699,"user_id":139985,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":69,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/147c5a9cc1feec049c50da791ac7d144?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Stephen C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/139985/stephen-c"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571366474,"last_edit_date":1571366474,"creation_date":1571366134,"answer_id":58443169,"question_id":58441679,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58443169","body_markdown":"The [javadoc][1] for `Map` show the signatures for `put` and `get` as:\r\n\r\n    V put(K key, V value)\r\n\r\n    V get(Object key)\r\n\r\nNote that the types of the `key` argument are inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWhy are they inconsistent?\r\n\r\nI think that the answer is for backwards compatibility with the pre-generic version of the `List` API.

am trying to find a list of words that are hidden in a digit soup. \r\nFirstly, i am trying to find words that are divided by digits into at least 5 groups. \r\nFor example:

9**car**0**dio**752901403085**vascular**93\r\n\r\n-All the letters are lowercase\r\n\r\n-There is no space in the text\r\n\r\nI only have the soup as a text file.

My first instinct was to try to use the grep command, but i don&#39;t see how i can get the words with grep without knowing anything about the words themselves.

Instead, you probably want a `ForeignKey` relationship between `Place` and the `Bar` model, since a *place* (eg San Fransisco) can have many bars, but a bar can only have *one place*.\r\n    \r\nUpdate\r\n-\r\nFrom my understanding of your comments, this is what I would suggest:\r\n\r\n   \r\n    class PlaceMixin(models.Model):\r\n        name = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        longitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        latitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\n        class Meta:\r\n            abstract = True\r\n        \r\n        def save(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n            latitude = self.latitude\r\n            longitude = self.longitude\r\n            do_stuff(latitude, longitude)\r\n            super().save()\r\n\r\n    class Location(PlaceMixin):\r\n        country = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        postal_code = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n        region = models.CharField(max_length=1000, choices=REGION, null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\n    class Bar(PlaceMixin):\r\n        location = models.ForeignKey(Location, related_name=&#39;bars&#39;, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\n    class Store(PlaceMixin):\r\n        location = models.ForeignKey(Location, related_name=&#39;stores&#39;, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n\r\nNow you can access both the lat/long of the `Place`, and of the `Location`:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;location = Location.objects.create(name=&#39;San Fransisco&#39;, latitude=1, longitude=1)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar = Bar.objects.create(name=&#39;Blackbird&#39;, latitude=2, longitude=2, location=location)\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar.latitude\r\n    2\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt;bar.location.latitude\r\n    1\r\n\r\nTo query all bars in San Fransisco:\r\n\r\n    location = Location.objects.select_related(&#39;Bar&#39;).get(name=&#39;San Fransisco&#39;)\r\n    bars = location.bars.all()\r\n    ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441674/link-to-child-to-parent-in-django-model/58441887#58441887","title":"Link to child to parent in Django model"}],"owner":{"reputation":350,"user_id":5222301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2315939e0879da3f8f0eeb57e80f8ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5222301/h-c"},"last_editor":{"reputation":350,"user_id":5222301,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":48,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2315939e0879da3f8f0eeb57e80f8ea?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"H C","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5222301/h-c"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58441887,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571362583,"creation_date":1571352628,"last_edit_date":1571353583,"question_id":58441674,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441674","body_markdown":"I have a Place Model:\r\n\r\n    class Place(models.Model):\r\n    \tname = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tcountry = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tpostal_code = models.CharField(max_length=100, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tregion = models.CharField(max_length=1000, choices=REGION, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tlongitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tlatitude = models.CharField(max_length=20, null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \r\n    \tdate_created = models.DateTimeField(_(&#39;date created&#39;), default=timezone.now)\r\n    \tdate_modified = models.DateTimeField(_(&#39;date_modified&#39;), auto_now=True)\r\n\r\nOriginally I create place to save information about a city, like San Francisco or New York.\r\n\r\nNow I want to create a new model called Bar:\r\n\r\n    class Bar(Place):\r\n    \tlocation = models.OneToOneField(Place, verbose_name=_(&#39;location&#39;), related_name=&#39;bar&#39;, blank=True, on_delete=models.PROTECT, parent_link=True)\r\n    \tdate_inception = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n    \tdate_closed = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)\r\n\r\nI would like to link the bar to a particular city in the Place model.

Workaround\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t think of an automated way to do this, but if you absolutely must achieve this, then a hacky way to do it is:\r\n\r\n1. Remove only the package(s) you want:\r\n\r\n        conda remove --force libtiff\r\n\r\n2. Trigger a consistency check to get a list of now broken packages:\r\n\r\n        conda install -d python\r\n\r\n3.

How can I avoid this problem?\r\n\r\nMy expected behaviour would be that ```conda remove seaborn``` removes ```seaborn``` and all of its dependencies, but does *not* remove any package (or dependencies thereof) that was explicitly installed before or after ```seaborn```. Some might say just uninstall ```seaborn``` and all 39 packages, and then manually reinstall ```matplotlib``` and ```pandas```. This works in trivial cases, but once there are e.g. 25 packages with complex interdependencies, this becomes very complicated, and at the very least a complete nuisance to maintain.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example of this, how can I construct a full Anaconda environment minus a particular package and *only* the packages that depend on it? I tried:\r\n\r\n    conda create -n test python=3.6 anaconda\r\n    conda remove libtiff  # I want this to strictly only remove libtiff and its recursive dependents, but obviously this is not what happens\r\n\r\nbut the second line removes essentially every single package in the entire environment as it removes ```anaconda```. Any ideas?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441645/conda-remove-uninstalls-more-packages-than-expected","title":"Conda remove uninstalls more packages than expected"},{"tags":["reactjs","create-react-app","postcss","autoprefixer"],"owner":{"reputation":5364,"user_id":1611058,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":73,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y1VDs.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel Tonon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1611058/daniel-tonon"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571352322,"creation_date":1571352322,"question_id":58441642,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441642","body_markdown":"I am trying to enable Autoprefixer Grid translations in a Create React App application.\r\n\r\n**I do not want to eject**.\r\n\r\nIs it still possible to enable grid translations without ejecting?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441642/how-do-you-enable-autoprefixer-css-grid-translations-in-create-react-app","title":"How do you enable Autoprefixer CSS Grid translations in create-react-app?"},{"tags":["java","user-interface","javafx","fxml","fxmlloader"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":184,"user_id":1836168,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ebcd2f66ed1c5298cf9300706afe2a62?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Peeyush","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1836168/peeyush"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352797,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103222875,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103222875_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":15457,"user_id":6395627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8dac5493d339ba8cb379f4efb2485d65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Slaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6395627/slaw"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571355454,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103223402,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103223402_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":26626,"user_id":1831987,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/38b1c37530189ec4471a43a618e33f67?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"VGR","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1831987/vgr"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571368103,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103225851,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103225851_58441638"},{"owner":{"reputation":1450,"user_id":2475470,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7b9b1aacdc6bbc9d7fba048300c0dee?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Grendel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2475470/grendel"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571385880,"post_id":58441638,"comment_id":103231223,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441638/what-does-getclass-getresource-construction-mean-with-javafx-fxml#comment103231223_58441638"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11239910,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ee4A9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Žeka Koževin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11239910/%c5%bdeka-ko%c5%beevin"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":27,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571410407,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571352274,"creation_date":1571352274,"question_id":58441638,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441638","body_markdown":"could you, please, explain what does this construction `getClass().getResource(&quot;...&quot;)` mean.

Instead you write to std::cout. So, you do not store the data.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you are calling new but never delete. With that you are creating a memory leak.\r\n\r\nThen, you still thinking to much in C. You should not use ````new```` or plain C-Style arrays.

Main problem, I think you are not initializing your arrays properly\r\n    1. Try using `Array.fill` or `Array.tabulate` to create and initialize arrays\r\n```\r\n  val rand = scala.util.Random\r\n  var x = Array.fill(parameter1)(rand.nextInt(100))\r\n  var y = Array.fill(parameter2)(rand.nextInt(100))\r\n```\r\n 1. You don&#39;t need the `.asUInt` in the `poke`, it accepts `Int`s or `BigInt`s\r\n 1. When defining hardware constants, use `.U` instead of `.asUInt`, the latter is a way of casting other chisel types, it does work but it a backward compatibility thing.\r\n 1. It&#39;s better to not start variables or methods with capital letters\r\n 1. I suggest us `class DutName(val parameter1: Int, val parameter2: Int)` or `class DutName(val parameter1: Int)(val parameter2: Int)` if you prefer.\r\n   1. This will allow to use the dut&#39;s paremeters when you are writing your test.\r\n   1. E.g. `for(i &lt;- 0 until dut.parameter1){poke(dut.io.IP2(i), x(i))}`\r\n   1.

I need to create a Whatsapp like message view, and to achieve that, I used a GridView component as a base. However, in order to draw the messages correctly, I need to create each GridView row with a different height, depending on the message text.\r\n\r\nBut to my surprise, I could not find any solution on the internet to achieve that, although I thought it was a simple formality. I tried a solution by myself, which I attached below, however it doesn&#39;t work. The issue is that all the rows take the height of the last resized one.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that Qt can do this, unfortunately, I have been looking for days now, and I can not find a solution to this issue. I simply have no idea about how to achieve that. So someone can explain to me how to create a GridView with variable height rows, or if the GridWiew isn&#39;t the appropriate component to do that, whcih I should use instead?\r\n\r\nHere is my qss file:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    import QtQuick 2.12\r\n    import QtQuick.Controls 2.5\r\n    import QtQuick.Window 2.12\r\n    import QtQuick.Layouts 1.11\r\n    \r\n    Window\r\n    {\r\n        visible: true\r\n        width: 640\r\n        height: 480\r\n        title: qsTr(&quot;Grid view&quot;)\r\n        color: &quot;#ffffff&quot;\r\n    \r\n        ColumnLayout\r\n        {\r\n            transformOrigin: Item.Center\r\n            spacing: 0\r\n            x: 0\r\n            y: 0\r\n            width: parent.width\r\n            height: parent.height\r\n    \r\n            /**\r\n            * Grid view item\r\n            */\r\n            Component\r\n            {\r\n                id: itGridItem\r\n    \r\n                Item\r\n                {\r\n                    Column\r\n                    {\r\n                        Rectangle\r\n                        {\r\n                            property int messageWidth: (gvMessageGrid.cellWidth / 2) - 50\r\n    \r\n                            id: itemRect\r\n                            x: senderIsMyself ? 25 : gvMessageGrid.cellWidth - (25 + messageWidth)\r\n                            y: 5\r\n                            width: messageWidth\r\n                            height: itemTextID.height + 20\r\n                            color: senderIsMyself ? &quot;#d5d5d5&quot; : &quot;#800b940e&quot;\r\n                            radius: 5\r\n                            clip: true\r\n    \r\n                            Text\r\n                            {\r\n                                id: itemTextID\r\n                                width: parent.width - 20\r\n                                text: itemText\r\n                                renderType: Text.NativeRendering\r\n                                textFormat: TextEdit.RichText\r\n                                wrapMode: Text.WordWrap\r\n                                font.family: &quot;Segoe UI Emoji&quot;\r\n                                font.pixelSize: 18\r\n                                anchors.margins: 10\r\n                                anchors.left: parent.left\r\n                                anchors.top: parent.top\r\n                                color: &quot;#101010&quot;\r\n                            }\r\n    \r\n                            onHeightChanged: gvMessageGrid.cellHeight = height + 10\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            /**\r\n            * Messages grid view\r\n            */\r\n            GridView\r\n            {\r\n                id: gvMessageGrid\r\n                y: 0\r\n                Layout.fillHeight: true\r\n                flickableDirection: Flickable.VerticalFlick\r\n                Layout.fillWidth: true\r\n                Layout.alignment: Qt.AlignHCenter | Qt.AlignVCenter\r\n                clip: true\r\n                contentWidth: 700\r\n                contentHeight: 300\r\n                cellWidth: contentWidth\r\n                cellHeight: 150\r\n                model: lmGridModel\r\n                delegate: itGridItem\r\n    \r\n                ScrollBar.vertical: ScrollBar\r\n                {\r\n                    visible: true\r\n                }\r\n    \r\n                onWidthChanged: cellWidth = width\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n**--- Edited on October 18, 2019**\r\n\r\nFollowing the eyllanesc suggestion below, here are 2 screenshots of what I want and what I get:\r\n\r\n**what I want**\r\n_______________________________________\r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n**what I get**\r\n_______________________________________\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n**NOTE** I&#39;m using several languages, for test purposes, because my application must have international support.

Thanks in advance to those who can help me.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441559/how-to-make-webview-open-last-accessed-url","title":"How to make WebView open last accessed url"},{"tags":["c#","winforms","unicode","icons","hamburger-menu"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352135,"post_id":58441557,"comment_id":103222735,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms#comment103222735_58441557"},{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":110754,"user_id":62576,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/15264f7bf48e10ce32dfa4865a13763c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Ken White","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/62576/ken-white"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571371260,"post_id":58441557,"comment_id":103226395,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms#comment103226395_58441557"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571373067,"post_id":58442216,"comment_id":103226763,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms/58442216#comment103226763_58442216"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":557,"user_id":9541862,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/44fe5271e65a59c7c1be5a45b618b078?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"quaabaam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9541862/quaabaam"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571357005,"creation_date":1571357005,"answer_id":58442216,"question_id":58441557,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58442216","body_markdown":"You can set the button text to the Unicode value in code like so...\r\n\r\n    button1.Text = char.ConvertFromUtf32(&#39;\\u2630&#39;); // &quot;☰&quot;;\r\n\r\nOr you can paste the symbol in the button&#39;s Text property in the designer properties list.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441557/using-hamburger-menu-symbol-icon-by-its-unicode-in-c-winforms/58442216#58442216","title":"Using hamburger menu symbol/icon by its unicode in C# Winforms"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":12175082,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mBKsWqJmM2fw6zhjtepPjS1ZfKNiHRQ5MRArcNhLw=k-s128","display_name":"Russell Chidhakwa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12175082/russell-chidhakwa"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58442216,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571357005,"creation_date":1571351645,"question_id":58441557,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441557","body_markdown":"I am trying to display a hamburger menu symbol/icon in a button control in Winforms C# using the symbol&#39;s unicode.

We run many services (utilizing TCP) that stream large amounts of data throughout these networks. We have written software which interacts with OpenDaylight to route this data, and it works just fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, if any UDP traffic is streamed through the network, OpenDaylight begins having issues and can no longer detect links between any of the switches. When the network is viewed through a GUI application (like DLUX, [the Cisco OpenFlow App][1], etc.), all of the switches appear disconnected after using UDP, and we can no longer route traffic through the network. Even when shutting down our custom routing software and attempting to do small iperf3 UDP tests, all of the links between the switches disappear. When doing iperf3 TCP tests, the network behaves normally.\r\n\r\nThe features we are using are minimal (```l2switch, openflowplugin, ovsdb, mdsal, and yangtools```). \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have experience with this problem? What are some solutions and ways I can dig into this and find out what is going wrong? \r\n\r\nAlso, is there any way in OpenDaylight or Open vSwitch where I can investigate links that have gone down? And is there any way I can bring them back up?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/OpenDaylight-Openflow-App","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441544/opendaylight-openvswitch-and-udp-traffic-issue","title":"OpenDaylight, OpenVSwitch, and UDP traffic issue"},{"tags":["java","intellij-idea","junit"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":301057,"user_id":104891,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0ff652685122f4500dd4f3c21fb32da2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"CrazyCoder","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/104891/crazycoder"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571352885,"post_id":58441543,"comment_id":103222898,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441543/intellij-suddenly-is-no-longer-able-to-find-junit-even-though-the-editor-recogni#comment103222898_58441543"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10736997,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ef7b5826881f55fc093463ebfc8d2c65?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Mattreex","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10736997/mattreex"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571351539,"creation_date":1571351539,"question_id":58441543,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441543","body_markdown":"I don&#39;t know why intellij is failing when I try to run these tests.

You expectation is correct.\r\n\r\nI do not think it has anything to do with lock, however. lock will only prevent a read and a write from happening at the same time, not produce this behavior. Try it without the lock to verify. (However due to things like the JiT Compiler, CPU cache invalidations and Optimisations, results may still differet if there is a lock, even if it has no direct effect).\r\n\r\nMy best bet is that the read thread is simply so slow, it does not finish *once* before the write is through all it&#39;s itteartions. Writing the UI is expensive, even on something as trivial as the console. Or even especially there. I do a lot of backups of userprofiles using robocopy. And if it hits a lot of very small files, just writing the Console becomes the *actuall programm bottleneck*, ever over *disk access*. And something out-bottlenecking disk acess is not something that happens often.\r\n\r\nIf you write the UI only once per user triggerd event, you will not notice the cost. But do it from any form of loop - especially one running in another thread - and you will start to notice it. I was particualry informed that a foreach is apparently half as slow at ittearting as a for loop.\r\n\r\nI even made a example for this, albeit in a Windows Forms Environment:\r\n\r\n    using System;\r\n    using System.Windows.Forms;\r\n    \r\n    namespace UIWriteOverhead\r\n    {\r\n        public partial class Form1 : Form\r\n        {\r\n            public Form1()\r\n            {\r\n                InitializeComponent();\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            int[] getNumbers(int upperLimit)\r\n            {\r\n                int[] ReturnValue = new int[upperLimit];\r\n    \r\n                for (int i = 0; i &lt; ReturnValue.Length; i++)\r\n                    ReturnValue[i] = i;\r\n    \r\n                return ReturnValue;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            void printWithBuffer(int[] Values)\r\n            {\r\n                textBox1.Text = &quot;&quot;;\r\n                string buffer = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n                foreach (int Number in Values)\r\n                    buffer += Number.ToString() + Environment.NewLine;\r\n                textBox1.Text = buffer;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            void printDirectly(int[] Values){\r\n                textBox1.Text = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    \r\n                foreach (int Number in Values)\r\n                    textBox1.Text += Number.ToString() + Environment.NewLine;\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            private void btnPrintBuffer_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Generating Numbers&quot;);\r\n                int[] temp = getNumbers(10000);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing with buffer&quot;);\r\n                printWithBuffer(temp);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing done&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n    \r\n            private void btnPrintDirect_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)\r\n            {\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Generating Numbers&quot;);\r\n                int[] temp = getNumbers(1000);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing directly&quot;);\r\n                printDirectly(temp);\r\n                MessageBox.Show(&quot;Printing done&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nBut even this overhead is pretty unlikey to have a presistent result. At some time the read thread should get the lock first, blocking write. But still, there are too many variables to say for sure. You should propably try a simpler example, with more consistent (and a whole lot less) writework. What about writing &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to the console, instead of complex stuff like this?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441539/why-lock-statement-doesnt-work-as-expected/58441653#58441653","title":"Why Lock statement doesn&#39;t work as expected"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12235422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAoWlJKcneZTCg4YdJoKq9-zKtffxgRPB02QED1=k-s128","display_name":"Stepan Penyaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12235422/stepan-penyaz"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12235422,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAoWlJKcneZTCg4YdJoKq9-zKtffxgRPB02QED1=k-s128","display_name":"Stepan Penyaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12235422/stepan-penyaz"},"comment_count":10,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":2,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58441653,"answer_count":1,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571383561,"creation_date":1571351495,"last_edit_date":1571383561,"question_id":58441539,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441539","body_markdown":"    static List&lt;int&gt; sharedCollection = new List&lt;int&gt;();\r\n    static readonly Object obj = new Object();\r\n    static void Main(string[] args)`enter code here`\r\n    {\r\n      var writeThread = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n      {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n        {\r\n          lock (obj)\r\n          {\r\n            Write();\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      var readThread = new Thread(() =&gt;\r\n      {\r\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)\r\n        {\r\n          lock (obj)\r\n          {\r\n            Read();\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      writeThread.Start();\r\n      readThread.Start();\r\n\r\n      Console.ReadLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Read()\r\n    {\r\n      Console.Write(&quot;Current collection state:  &quot;);\r\n      sharedCollection.ForEach((e) =&gt; Console.Write($&quot;{e}  &quot;));\r\n      Console.WriteLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    static void Write()\r\n    {\r\n      Random generator = new Random();\r\n      var addedValue = generator.Next(1, 20);\r\n      sharedCollection.Add(addedValue);\r\n      Console.WriteLine($&quot;Added value is: {addedValue}&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time trying to understand why I receive this:\r\n[console result][1]\r\n\r\nCould someone explain to me what is wrong with this code?\r\n\r\nMutex works fine but I need to illustrate lock statement too...\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/jpvXV.jpg\r\n\r\nI expect that after every adding in 1st thread I obtain a collection state from the 2nd thread.

reason why the output gives you 30 days is because...\r\n\r\nThe function &quot;days_in_month&quot; is supposed to return an integer but you are not returning one explicitly.The function, thus, defaults to returning an integer implicitly but it is not what is expected, this causes the `if(days_in_month(month, year) == 31)` condition to fail each time and the code prints the text in the `else` block.\r\n\r\nApart from this, there are other inaccuracies in the code:\r\n\r\n 1. The &quot;month&quot; parameter passed to the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function\r\n   is not utilized anywhere within the function.\r\n 2. In the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function, you are checking for equality\r\n    for `num_days`(ex: `num_days== 31`). This should instead be\r\n    `num_days = 31`.\r\n 3. In the &quot;days_in_month&quot; function the `else(month_given== 2);`\r\n    is not correct.&quot;else&quot; is the default case and should be followed by\r\n    a statement. It does not check conditions.\r\n 4. The `while` statement should also check for input greater than 12.\r\n    Like so `while(month != 0 &amp;&amp; month &lt; 13)`\r\n 5. Lastly, there is a logical flaw in the placement of the &quot;else&quot;\r\n        clause in the &quot;main&quot; function.Please note that &quot;else&quot; handles the\r\n        &quot;none of the above&quot; condition.By placing the &quot;else&quot; in between two\r\n        &quot;if&quot;s, if the first &quot;if&quot; fails, the &quot;else&quot; is guaranteed to execute even before the second &quot;if&quot; is tested.\r\n\r\nImplementing the corrections would result is a working code(listed below)....but there is scope for improvement.\r\n\r\n1.The variable &quot;year&quot; is declared but not utilized anywhere.You should \r\n   collect input for this variable and implement a condition to display \r\n   the correct days for February depending on whether the year is a   \r\n   leap year or not.Preferably in &quot;main&quot;.\r\n\r\n2.You could call &quot;days_in_month&quot; just once and check the returned value\r\n   with the conditions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n    int main()\r\n    {\r\n

For instance, you may state that at some point the number of processes (see **[_nr_pr][1]**) that are in execution becomes equal to `0` (or more, if you admit *some* infinite loops), or check that a particular process terminates correctly using [remote references][2].\r\n\r\nBoth cases are contained in the following example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c++ --&gt;\r\n\r\n    byte x = 0; byte y = 0;\r\n    active proctype toggle() {\r\n        do\r\n        :: x == 1 -&gt; x = 0\r\n        :: x == 0 -&gt; x = 1\r\n        od;\r\n    end:\r\n    }\r\n    init {\r\n        (y == 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // sooner or later, the process toggle\r\n    // with _pid == 0 will reach the end\r\n    // state\r\n    ltl p1 { &lt;&gt; toggle[0]@end };\r\n\r\n    // sooner or later, the number of processes\r\n    // that are currently running becomes 0,\r\n    // (hence, there can be no infinite loops)\r\n    ltl p2 { &lt;&gt; (_nr_pr == 0) };\r\n\r\nBoth the first\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ~$ spin -a -search -ltl p1 test.pml\r\n    ~$ spin -t test.pml\r\n    ltl p1: &lt;&gt; ((toggle[0]@end))\r\n    ltl p2: &lt;&gt; ((_nr_pr==0))\r\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;START OF CYCLE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    Never claim moves to line 4\t[(!((toggle[0]._p==end)))]\r\n    spin: trail ends after 8 steps\r\n    #processes: 2\r\n    \t\tx = 0\r\n    \t\ty = 0\r\n    \t\tend = 0\r\n      8:\tproc  1 (:init::1) test.pml:10 (state 1)\r\n      8:\tproc  0 (toggle:1) test.pml:3 (state 5)\r\n      8:\tproc  - (p1:1) _spin_nvr.tmp:3 (state 3)\r\n    2 processes created\r\n\r\nand the second\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n    \r\n    ~$ spin -a -search -ltl p2 test.pml\r\n    ~$ spin -t test.pml\r\n    ltl p1: &lt;&gt; ((toggle[0]@end))\r\n    ltl p2: &lt;&gt; ((_nr_pr==0))\r\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;START OF CYCLE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\r\n    Never claim moves to line 11\t[(!((_nr_pr==0)))]\r\n    spin: trail ends after 8 steps\r\n    #processes: 2\r\n    \t\tx = 0\r\n    \t\ty = 0\r\n    \t\tend = 0\r\n      8:\tproc  1 (:init::1) test.pml:10 (state 1)\r\n      8:\tproc  0 (toggle:1) test.pml:3 (state 5)\r\n      8:\tproc  - (p2:1) _spin_nvr.tmp:10 (state 3)\r\n    2 processes created\r\n\r\n\r\nLTL properties are found to be false.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; Regarding the &#39;unreached in proctype&#39; messages, adding an end label to the do loop doesn&#39;t seem to do anything.\r\n\r\nThe `end` label(s) are used to **remove** the *&quot;invalid end state&quot;* **error** that would be otherwise be found. \r\n\r\nFor example, modifying your previous example as follows:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: c++ --&gt;\r\n\r\n    byte x = 0; byte y = 0;\r\n    active proctype toggle() {\r\n        skip;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    init {\r\n    end:\r\n        (y == 1);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nMakes the error go away:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: bash --&gt;\r\n\r\n    ~$ spin -a -search test.pml\r\n    (Spin Version 6.5.0 -- 17 July 2019)\r\n    ...\r\n    State-vector 20 byte, depth reached 1, errors: 0\r\n    ...\r\n\r\nOne should only ever use an [**end**][4] label when one is willing to **guarantee** that a process being stuck with no executable instruction is not a symptom of an undesired deadlock situation.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/_nr_pr.html\r\n  [2]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/remoterefs.html\r\n  [3]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/progress.html\r\n  [4]: http://spinroot.com/spin/Man/end.html\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58441532/why-an-infinite-loop-doesnt-result-in-an-error-in-model-checking-with-promela-a/58446872#58446872","title":"Why an infinite loop doesn&#39;t result in an error in model checking with Promela and Spin?"}],"owner":{"reputation":81,"user_id":6553631,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a382e5eed46ae9d3558510513079c683?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"tgonzaleza","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6553631/tgonzaleza"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5541,"user_id":6024122,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-uiRWa4coXLs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAJUs/5BxfhSS1bUY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Patrick Trentin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6024122/patrick-trentin"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58446872,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571388285,"creation_date":1571351464,"last_edit_date":1571388123,"question_id":58441532,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58441532","body_markdown":"If I write the following code in Promela and run it in Spin in verifier mode it ends with 0 errors.

currently have a script that will combine multiple csv files into one, the script works fine except that we run out of ram really quickly when larger files start being used. This is an issue for one reason, the script runs on an AWS server and running out of RAM means a server crash.\r\nCurrently the file size limit is around 250mb each, and that limits us to 2 files, however as the company I work is in Biotech and we&#39;re using Genetic Sequencing files, the files we use can range in size from 17mb up to around 700mb depending on the experiment. My idea has been to load one dataframe into memory whole and then chunk the others and combine iteratively, this didn&#39;t work so well.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy dataframes are similar to this (they can vary in size, but some columns remain the same; &quot;Mod&quot;, &quot;AA&quot; and &quot;Nuc&quot;)\r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen combining the two frames I need them to merge on &quot;Mod&quot;, &quot;Nuc&quot; and &quot;AA&quot; so that I have something similar to this \r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 | 2_1 | 2_2 | 2_3 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   | 5   | 29  | 0   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nI already have code to change the names of the headers so I&#39;m not worried about that, however when I use chunks I end up with something closer to \r\n\r\n```\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| Mod | Nuc | AA  | 1_1 | 1_2 | 1_3 | 1_4 | 1_5 | 2_1 | 2_2 | 2_3 | 3_1 | 3_2 | 3_3 |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 000 | ABC | ABC | 10  | 5   | 9   | 16  | 8   | 5   | 29  | 0   | NA  | NA  | NA  |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n| 010 | CBA | CBA | 0   | 1   | 4   | 9   | 0   | NA  | NA  | NA  | 0   | 0   | 1   |\r\n+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+\r\n```\r\n\r\nbasically it treats each chunk as if it were a new file and not from the same one. \r\n\r\nI know why its doing that but I&#39;m not sure on how to fix this, right now my code for chunking is really simple.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    file = &quot;tableFile/123456.txt&quot;\r\n    initDF = pd.read_csv(file, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, header=0)\r\n    file2 = &quot;tableFile/7891011.txt&quot;\r\n    for chunks in pd.read_csv(file2, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, chunksize=50000, header=0):\r\n        initDF = initDF.merge(chunks, how=&#39;right&#39;, on=[&#39;Mod&#39;, &quot;Nuc&quot;, &quot;AA&quot;])\r\n```\r\n\r\nas you can see its pretty bare bones, as I said I know why its doing what its doing but I&#39;m not experienced with Pandas nor with dataframe joins to be able to fix it so any help would be much appreciated.
