   return _mm512_loadu_si512(temp+(64-imm8));\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis should also work if `imm8` was not known at compile time, but it does not do any out-of-bounds checks.\r\nYou could actually use a `3*64` temporary and share it between the left and right shift methods (and both would work for negative inputs as well).\r\n\r\nOf course, if you share a temporary outside the function body, you must make sure that it is not accessed by multiple threads at once.\r\n\r\nGodbolt-Link with usage demonstration: https://godbolt.org/z/LSgeWZ\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs Peter noted, **this store-load trick will cause a store-forwarding stall on all CPUs with AVX512**.  The most-efficient forwarding case (~6 cycle latency) only works when all the load bytes come from one store.  If the load goes outside the most recent store that overlaps it at all, it has extra latency (like ~16 cycles) to scan the store buffer and if needed merge in bytes from L1d cache.  See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46135766/can-modern-x86-implementations-store-forward-from-more-than-one-prior-store and [Agner Fog&#39;s microarch guide][1]for more details. This extra-scanning process can probably be happening for multiple loads in parallel, and at least doesn&#39;t stall other things (like normal store-forwarding or the rest of the pipeline), so it may not be a throughput problem.\r\n\r\nIf you want many shift offsets of the same data, one store and multiple reloads at different alignments should be good.\r\n\r\nBut if latency is your primary issue you should try a solution based on `valignd` (also, if you want to shift by a multiple of 4 bytes that is obviously an easier solution).  Or for constant shift-counts, a vector control for `vpermw` could work.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nFor completeness, here is a version based on `valignd` and `valignr` working for shifts from 0 to 64, known at compile-time (using C++17 -- but you can easily avoid the `if constexpr` this is only here because of the `static_assert`). Instead of shifting in zeros you can pass a second register (i.e., it behaves like `valignr` would behave if it would align across lanes).\r\n\r\n    template&lt;int N&gt;\r\n    __m512i shift_right(__m512i a, __m512i carry = _mm512_setzero_si512())\r\n    {\r\n      static_assert(0 &lt;= N &amp;&amp; N &lt;= 64);\r\n      if constexpr(N   == 0) return a;\r\n      if constexpr(N   ==64) return carry;\r\n      if constexpr(N%4 == 0) return _mm512_alignr_epi32(carry, a, N / 4);\r\n      else\r\n      {\r\n        __m512i a0 = shift_right&lt; (N/16 + 1)*16&gt;(a, carry);  // 16, 32, 48, 64\r\n        __m512i a1 = shift_right&lt; (N/16    )*16&gt;(a, carry);  //  0, 16, 32, 48\r\n        return _mm512_alignr_epi8(a0, a1, N % 16);\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    template&lt;int N&gt;\r\n    __m512i shift_left(__m512i a, __m512i carry = _mm512_setzero_si512())\r\n    {\r\n      return shift_right&lt;64-N&gt;(carry, a);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nHere is a godbolt-link with some example assembly as well as output for every possible `shift_right` operation: https://godbolt.org/z/xmKJvA\r\n\r\nGCC faithfully translates this into `valignd` and `valignr` instructions -- but may do an unnecessary `vpxor` instruction (e.g. in the `shiftleft_49` example), Clang does some crazy substitutions (not sure if they actually make a difference, though).\r\n\r\nThe code could be extended to shift an arbitrary sequence of registers (always carrying bytes from the previous register).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://agner.org/optimize/\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322652/emulating-shifts-on-64-bytes-with-avx-512/58396344#58396344","title":"Emulating shifts on 64 bytes with AVX-512"}],"owner":{"reputation":3763,"user_id":2970186,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vo0Wc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Daniel","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2970186/daniel"},"comment_count":8,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":99,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58396344,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571337676,"creation_date":1570709577,"question_id":58322652,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322652","body_markdown":"My question is an extension of a previous question: [Emulating shifts on 32 bytes with AVX](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25248766/emulating-shifts-on-32-bytes-with-avx/25264853#25264853).\r\n\r\nHow do I implement similar shifts on 64 bytes with AVX-512?

solution provided by @Saharsh already answers in an easy way. But I would recommend to use more appropiate types for each instance.\r\n\r\nTimes should be stored in `datetime.date`, if the order of a dict matters you have `collections.OrderedDict` (it does not sort the keys, it keeps them in the same order than you entered them into the dict) and if you want to keep a list of already known users you should use a `set`.\r\n\r\n# Dates\r\n\r\nFirst lets check how to convert date strings into date objects\r\n```python\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\ndate = datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-10&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;)\r\nprint(type(date), date) # &lt;class &#39;datetime.datetime&#39;&gt; 2019-10-10 00:00:00\r\ndate = date.date()\r\nprint(type(date), date) # &lt;class &#39;datetime.date&#39;&gt; 2019-10-10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `strptime` method of the `datetime` class inside the `datetime` module (yes, module and class have the same name) will provide you a `datetime` object which contains both the date and time information. As we only care about the date we can use the `date` method to extract the date as an instance of the `date` class. This `datetime` and `date` objects can be used as keys for our `dict`s.\r\n\r\n# Sorted dicts\r\n\r\nNow lets see how a `OrderedDict` works:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\n\r\nd = OrderedDict()\r\nd[3] = 1\r\nd[2] = 2\r\nd[5] = 3\r\nd[1] = 0\r\nprint(d) # OrderedDict([(3, 1), (2, 2), (5, 3), (1, 0)]) \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe dict is not printed as pretty as the others but it works exactly as a normal dict except that it guanrantees that the insertion order is mantained. While this may seem trivial, the normal dict has no guarantee that this will happen, you nay get the `1=&gt;0` pair before the `5=&gt;3` while iterating. In our case this matters as every date has to be processed chronologically.\r\n\r\n# Sets\r\n\r\nSets are like lists but they can not contain duplicate items and they provide some extra methods for common set operations such as unions or differences.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nc = {&#39;sam&#39;, &#39;ram&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;queen&#39;, &#39;kumar&#39;, &#39;jeba&#39;, &#39;howl&#39;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA set is as simple as using curly brackets (`{}`) instead of square brackets (`[]`).\r\n\r\n# Full solution\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nvisitors = OrderedDict()\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-10&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;sam&#39;, &#39;maha&#39;}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-11&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;sam&#39;, &#39;prince&#39;, &#39;kumar&#39;, &#39;jeba&#39;}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-12&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;ram&#39;, &#39;prince&#39;}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-13&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;raja&#39;, &#39;peer&#39;}\r\n\r\nknown_visitors = {&#39;sam&#39;, &#39;ram&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;queen&#39;, &#39;kumar&#39;, &#39;jeba&#39;, &#39;howl&#39;}\r\n\r\nnew_visitors_count = OrderedDict()\r\nfor date, visited in visitors.items():\r\n    new_visitors = visited.difference(known_visitors)\r\n    known_visitors = known_visitors.union(new_visitors)\r\n    new_visitors_count[date] = len(new_visitors)\r\n\r\nprint(new_visitors_count)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `visitors` `OrderedDict` is the equivalent to your `b` `dict` while the `known_visitors` `set` is equivalent to your `c` `list`. As you can see I also removed the `1`s from `visitors` turning the inner `dict`s into `set`s but you can keep them if they provide any info by changing the first line inside the loop to `new_visitors = set(visited).difference(known_visitors)`.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\r\nfrom datetime import datetime\r\n\r\nvisitors = OrderedDict()\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-10&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;sam&#39;: 1, &#39;maha&#39;: 1}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-11&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;sam&#39;: 1, &#39;prince&#39;: 1, &#39;kumar&#39;: 1, &#39;jeba&#39;: 1}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-12&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;ram&#39;: 1, &#39;prince&#39;: 1}\r\nvisitors[datetime.strptime(&#39;2019-10-13&#39;, &#39;%Y-%m-%d&#39;).date()] = {&#39;raja&#39;: 1, &#39;peer&#39;: 1}\r\n\r\nknown_visitors = {&#39;sam&#39;, &#39;ram&#39;, &#39;king&#39;, &#39;queen&#39;, &#39;kumar&#39;, &#39;jeba&#39;, &#39;howl&#39;}\r\n\r\nnew_visitors_count = OrderedDict()\r\nfor date, visited in visitors.items():\r\n    new_visitors = set(visited).difference(known_visitors)\r\n    known_visitors = known_visitors.union(new_visitors)\r\n    new_visitors_count[date] = len(new_visitors)\r\n\r\nprint(new_visitors_count)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLoop explanation:\r\nWhat we are doing is first obtain the difference of the `visited` `set` that are the ones that visited each day with the `known_visitors` that are those that have already visited previously. Basically this means substract the already known ones from each days. Then we update the already known ones so that next days will take those into consideration. And last we update the count of the corresponding date by computing the length of the `visited` `set`.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322644/count-users-on-date-if-not-exists-in-another-list-python/58323066#58323066","title":"Count users on date if not exists in another list python"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2704,"user_id":5612096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51821186ffde540f4d10b86544ca1a7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adirio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5612096/adirio"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570711228,"post_id":58323085,"comment_id":103004935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322644/count-users-on-date-if-not-exists-in-another-list-python/58323085#comment103004935_58323085"},{"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":4720652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnRIv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720652/saharsh"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2704,"user_id":5612096,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/51821186ffde540f4d10b86544ca1a7d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Adirio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5612096/adirio"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570711723,"post_id":58323085,"comment_id":103005262,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322644/count-users-on-date-if-not-exists-in-another-list-python/58323085#comment103005262_58323085"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":669,"user_id":4720652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnRIv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720652/saharsh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":669,"user_id":4720652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/MnRIv.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Saharsh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720652/saharsh"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570711661,"last_edit_date":1570711661,"creation_date":1570711117,"answer_id":58323085,"question_id":58322644,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58323085","body_markdown":"Just add the new user to your known user&#39;s array once an unknown user arrives.

That has some restrictions on when it can be updated. The [documentation for that](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adts/6e803168-f140-4d23-b2d3-c3a8ab5917d2) says:\r\n\r\n&gt;Windows 2000 operating system servers require that the client have a 128-bit (or better) SSL/TLS-encrypted connection to the DC in order to modify this attribute. On Windows Server 2003 operating system and later, the DC also permits modification of the unicodePwd attribute on a connection protected by 128-bit (or better) Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)-layer encryption instead of SSL/TLS.\r\n\r\nIt should setup a secure connection by default (it does for me), but it&#39;s possible that it can&#39;t in your setup for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nYou can pass a [`ContextOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.directoryservices.accountmanagement.contextoptions) object in the constructor to your `PrincipalContext`. By default that is automatically set to `ContextOptions.Negotiate | ContextOptions.Signing | ContextOptions.Sealing`, which should be secure. But `ContextOptions.Negotiate` uses &quot;either Kerberos or NTLM&quot;, and `ContextOptions.Signing` (the encryption) depends on Kerberos. So maybe it&#39;s falling back to NTLM and can&#39;t encrypt.\r\n\r\nYou *might* be able to confirm this by inspecting these values, after you create the account:\r\n\r\n```\r\nConsole.WriteLine(ctx.Options);\r\nConsole.WriteLine(((DirectoryEntry) usr.GetUnderlyingObject()).AuthenticationType);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe values you&#39;d be looking for are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNegotiate, Signing, Sealing\r\nSecure, Signing, Sealing\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s what I have when `SetPassword` works. But I&#39;m not sure if it actually changes those values if it falls back to NTLM. Sometimes it does that pretty silently.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if Kerberos isn&#39;t happening, you can either troubleshoot that, or attempt to connect via LDAPS (LDAP over SSL). That would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrincipalContext ctx = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain,\r\n    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;DOMAIN&quot;) + &quot;:636&quot;,\r\n    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;USER_OU&quot;),\r\n    ContextOptions.Negotiate | ContextOptions.SecureSocketLayer,\r\n    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;SERVICE_USERNAME&quot;),\r\n    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;SERVICE_PASSWORD&quot;));\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that can cause other issues since your DC needs to have a certificate that you trust.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322613/server-2016-ad-and-iis-express-cannot-set-user-password-but-can-create-user/58324282#58324282","title":"Server 2016 AD and IIS Express Cannot Set User Password but Can Create User"}],"owner":{"reputation":116,"user_id":10972795,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/051019f1d51e86f45178fe37a131fde7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Hawke","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10972795/hawke"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58324282,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570714587,"creation_date":1570709460,"question_id":58322613,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322613","body_markdown":"I had to create a new dev environment with less VMs as my IDE kept crashing, so I created a VM with AD and IIS on the same server.\r\n\r\nI was using the following code fine in my old environment:\r\n\r\n          PrincipalContext ctx = new PrincipalContext(ContextType.Domain,\r\n                    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;DOMAIN&quot;),\r\n                    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;USER_OU&quot;),\r\n                    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;SERVICE_USERNAME&quot;),\r\n                    Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;SERVICE_PASSWORD&quot;));\r\n\r\n            UserPrincipalEx usr = new UserPrincipalEx(ctx);\r\n\r\n            usr.Name = ticket.FirstName + &quot; &quot; + ticket.LastName;\r\n            usr.SamAccountName = ticket.Username;\r\n            usr.GivenName = ticket.FirstName;\r\n            usr.Surname = ticket.LastName;\r\n            usr.DisplayName = ticket.FirstName + &quot; &quot; + ticket.Account.LastName;\r\n            usr.UserPrincipalName = ticket.Username + &quot;@&quot; + Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(&quot;DOMAIN&quot;);\r\n            usr.Enabled = enabled;\r\n            \r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                usr.Save();\r\n                usr.SetPassword(temppwd);\r\n                usr.ExpirePasswordNow();\r\n            }\r\n\r\nI can still save the user and it appears in AD, however SetPassword no longer works:\r\n\r\n    [IIS EXPRESS] Request started: &quot;POST&quot; https://localhost:5001/create\r\n    System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---&gt; System.UnauthorizedAccessException: Access is denied.

want to create a string from a list of substrings and a correponding frequency list.

It serves a similar purpose as redux-thunk and redux-saga.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s an example where you can trigger a fetch and describe how to handle success and failure, all from your reducer. \r\n\r\n```js\r\n//reducer.js\r\nimport { loop, Cmd } from &#39;redux-loop&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst initialState = {\r\n  loading: false,\r\n  data: null,\r\n  error: null\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction reducer(state = initialState, action){\r\n  if(action.type === &#39;pageLoaded&#39;){\r\n    const newState = {...state, loading: true};\r\n    const cmd = Cmd.run(fetchData, {\r\n      successActionCreator: dataLoaded,\r\n      failActionCreator: dataLoadFailed,\r\n      args: [action.itemId]\r\n    });\r\n    return loop(newState, cmd);\r\n  }\r\n  else if(action.type === &#39;dataLoaded&#39;){\r\n    return {\r\n      ...state,\r\n      loading: false,\r\n      data: action.data,\r\n      error: null\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  else if(action.type === &#39;dataLoadFailed&#39;){\r\n    return {\r\n      loading: false,\r\n      error: action.error\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n  return state;\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default reducer;\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that fetchData is never actually called from your reducer, so it is still a pure function that just returns data and is easily testable.\r\n\r\nYou would redux-loop it in a react-native application for the same reason that you would use it in a regular react application with redux, which is that redux by itself does not provide a way to directly run side effects from redux code. Instead it let you decide for yourself how you want to do that by allowing you to write middleware and store enhancers for redux, which redux-loop is.\r\n\r\nYou can read more at https://redux-loop.js.org/\r\n\r\nNote: I maintain redux-loop","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322566/what-is-redux-loop-and-how-can-we-use-it-in-react-native/58367678#58367678","title":"What is redux-loop and How can we use it in react native"}],"owner":{"reputation":59,"user_id":10926294,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f0a81035bbad519049978a638271e63d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Rama","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10926294/rama"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58367678,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570999760,"creation_date":1570709308,"question_id":58322566,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322566","body_markdown":"What is redux-loop and what is the main purpose of using it in a React Native Application?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322566/what-is-redux-loop-and-how-can-we-use-it-in-react-native","title":"What is redux-loop and How can we use it in react native"},{"tags":["python","numpy","f2py"],"owner":{"reputation":26,"user_id":10075386,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/abBpi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Ramesh K","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10075386/ramesh-k"},"last_editor":{"reputation":10,"user_id":12166089,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d05ad52870eba1238e968189eeb3ffe3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JT01","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12166089/jt01"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":24,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570725001,"creation_date":1570709304,"last_edit_date":1570725001,"question_id":58322563,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322563","body_markdown":"I have created a module of a Fortran function using f2py and used in my code.

Maybe my modeling is wrong?\r\n\r\nBut with polymorphic model i can query:\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt; models.Object1.objects.get(pk=1).attribute_set.all()[0].url                                                                                      \r\n    &#39;http://www.dot.com&#39;\r\n\r\nI just need to catch the type of object to not run into:\r\n\r\n    AttributeError: &#39;Attribute&#39; object has no attribute &#39;url&#39;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHope somebody can help or explain the topic further even so I found something that works for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33528098/django-model-one-foreign-key-to-many-tables\r\n  [2]: https://django-polymorphic.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322535/many-to-many-reverse-field-lookup-with-ids-in-django-polymorphic-model","title":"Many-To-Many reverse field lookup with ids in Django | Polymorphic Model"},{"tags":["angular","typescript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":118521,"user_id":2435473,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8hKGc.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pankaj Parkar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2435473/pankaj-parkar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570709326,"post_id":58322534,"comment_id":103003824,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322534/can-i-add-attributes-to-window-object-in-angular-7#comment103003824_58322534"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7142,"user_id":5621827,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DQqw.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jitender","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5621827/jitender"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570709293,"creation_date":1570709293,"answer_id":58322560,"question_id":58322534,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58322560","body_markdown":"Try casting window to `any` like\r\n\r\n    (window as any).attr = &quot;my_value&quot;\r\n\r\nOr define type on the top of the component after your imports\r\n\r\n    declare var window: any;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322534/can-i-add-attributes-to-window-object-in-angular-7/58322560#58322560","title":"Can I add attributes to &#39;window&#39; object in Angular 7?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":7358,"user_id":7603109,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ndJ1I.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Adrita Sharma","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7603109/adrita-sharma"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570709301,"creation_date":1570709301,"answer_id":58322561,"question_id":58322534,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58322561","body_markdown":"Try like this:\r\n\r\n     Window[&quot;attr&quot;] = &quot;my_value&quot;;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322534/can-i-add-attributes-to-window-object-in-angular-7/58322561#58322561","title":"Can I add attributes to &#39;window&#39; object in Angular 7?"}],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":6921612,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/iU0i0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Phil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6921612/phil"},"last_editor":{"reputation":5740,"user_id":7194268,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/def585555f060fee8dcc065f270e403b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mbojko","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7194268/mbojko"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"closed_date":1570713071,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570710332,"creation_date":1570709168,"last_edit_date":1570710332,"question_id":58322534,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322534","body_markdown":"Can I add any attribute to &#39;window&#39; object in Angular?

Any pointers to get started with the regular expression needed to create a custom object for sorting purposes would be appreciated\r\n\r\nthe following solution does the following:\r\n\r\n* For sorting purposes, it transforms each input string with number-only components `0`-left-padded to a fixed width, so that sorting by the resulting string effectively sorts the embedded number numerically.\r\n\r\n  * For instance, input string `K1-4-2-8 Lorem ipsum` is transformed into `K1-0004-0002-0008 Lorem ipsum`.\r\n\r\nPowerShell _Core_ solution:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$a | Sort-Object { $_ -replace &#39;(?&lt;=-)\\d+&#39;, { &#39;{0:0000}&#39; -f [int] $_.Value  } }\r\n```\r\n\r\n&lt;sup&gt;Adjust the number of `0`s for padding based as needed, based on how many digits the numbers can have at most.&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nIf only the first space-separated token is relevant for sorting (e.g., `K1-4-2-8`, but not `Lorem ipsum`), you can trim the input string by providing `$_ -replace &#39; .*&#39;` instead of just `$_` as the LHS of the `-replace` operation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn _Windows PowerShell_, the [`-replace` operator](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40683667/45375) doesn&#39;t support a script blocks as the replacement operand, so you have to use the `[regex]` .NET type directly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$a | Sort-Object { \r\n    [regex]::Replace($_, &#39;(?&lt;=-)\\d+&#39;, { param($m) &#39;{0:0000}&#39; -f [int] $m.Value })\r\n  }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322520/regex-in-powershell-for-custom-sorting/58323294#58323294","title":"Regex in PowerShell for custom sorting"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":1279627,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZAQyL.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Jan Egil Ring","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1279627/jan-egil-ring"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570786541,"post_id":58335181,"comment_id":103032554,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322520/regex-in-powershell-for-custom-sorting/58335181#comment103032554_58335181"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":9327,"user_id":2413201,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rxfuw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Armali","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2413201/armali"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570774242,"creation_date":1570774242,"answer_id":58335181,"question_id":58322520,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58335181","body_markdown":"Your _Required output_ does not follow the given rules, in particular the rule\r\n\r\n- _Depth matters, for example K2a comes before K2-5_\r\n\r\nis not compatible with the desired order\r\n~~~\r\nK2a Lorem ipsum\r\nK2-5 Lorem ipsum\r\nK2-6 Lorem ipsum\r\nK2-7 Lorem ipsum\r\nK2b Lorem ipsum\r\n~~~\r\nThe screenshot shows that the data is organized in a tree structure.

I created an Ionic 4 project which I think defaults to the router for navigation.\r\n\r\nApp opens up on home, steps that I am taking:\r\n\r\n1) Select menu option\r\n\r\n2) Gets navigated to selected item from #1 (Page 1)\r\n\r\n3) In page 1, you can go back via `ion-back-button defaultHref`. In this page, there is an ion-list where I can click and view more details\r\n\r\n4) Click on an item which takes me to Page 2 (You can also go back here)\r\n\r\n5) In Page 2, there is another list where you can click\r\n\r\n6) click on an item which takes you to Page 3.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n=&gt; Home =&gt; Fruits List =&gt; Type of Oranges List =&gt; Detail of selected type of orange\r\n  \r\nThis is now the final page. What I&#39;m trying to do is, once an item is clicked on step no. 6, if the data cannot be loaded then display an alert which has the button &#39;Close&#39;. I am trying to bind this alert button with the action to go back.\r\n\r\nAn answer I found was to use the Location service and bind this action:\r\n\r\n    this.location.back();\r\n\r\nWhich I have but this takes the user all the way back to Home instead of the previous page. Another answer was to use the NavController but wouldn&#39;t I need to completely change the routing of my app to use that? Is there any way to go back to the previous page?\r\n\r\nThis is what I use to navigate forwards to page:\r\n\r\n    this.router.navigate([&#39;page1&#39;],{replaceUrl: false});\r\n\r\nI could use the same thing for going back but it doesn&#39;t have the correct animation and I think the routing gets messed up if I use to go back.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nRunning Ionic Version 5.4.1\r\n\r\nMore information:\r\n\r\n    this.alertCtrl\r\n      .create({\r\n        header: &#39;Error&#39;,\r\n        message: &#39;Failed to Load Data.

If it does not, how to keep clients connections open? (At them moment, I&#39;m thinking to send an empty message to keep the connection.)\r\n2.

For this, I need to sync the timer running on users browser with the server and keep some additional data of the test stored on the server while the test is running. \r\n\r\nFollowing are the usecases to consider:\r\n\r\na. On test start, test data is fetched, stored in a variable with socket.io and timer is started - working\r\n\r\nb. On action from the user, event is fired from the front end and test data on socket.io is updated - working\r\n\r\nc. On disconnect, updated test data is saved back to the database (while the data is also present in socket io) - Event is firing a few seconds late on internet disconnect\r\n\r\nd. On reconnect, the last available test data should be available on the socket\r\n\r\ne. On page refresh, the last available test data should be sent back to the browser and test should be resumed\r\n\r\nUsecase a, b and c are working perfectly. Whereas, on usecase d, at the time of reconnect, socket id is changing and the data stored with socket.io is being lost. \r\n\r\nTo fix this, I added code to fetch the data back from database on reconnect. Which works well in the scenarios when there&#39;s some time gap between disconnect and reconnect. But on page refresh, disconnect event doesn&#39;t get fired right away and the last saved data in the databse is being returned to the client. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to use a custom socket id and keep the data persistent on socket.io when a disconnect and reconnect usecase happens?\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322472/synced-timer-with-socket-io","title":"Synced timer with socket.io"},{"tags":["overlay","imx6","chromium-os","imx7"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3529732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5df7a78950982922d7b887b9d41bcc56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3529732","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3529732/user3529732"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571381653,"post_id":58322468,"comment_id":103229358,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322468/chromium-os-support-on-i-mx6#comment103229358_58322468"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":3529732,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5df7a78950982922d7b887b9d41bcc56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user3529732","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3529732/user3529732"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1907,"user_id":1105510,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/8TEse.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"inizio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1105510/inizio"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":15,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570709511,"creation_date":1570708911,"last_edit_date":1570709511,"question_id":58322468,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58322468","body_markdown":"I&#39;m looking for help to compile and run Chromium OS on a `freescale i.mx6` anyone know how to do this?

Although since you&#39;re checking a boolean, you don&#39;t need an `else if` - if `status` is not `false`, then it can only be `true`. You can just do\r\n\r\n```\r\nif (status === false) {\r\n  /* ... code if false ... */\r\n} else  {\r\n  /* ... code if true ... */\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. You set `status = false` and `status = true` twice. First in `myFunction`, then in `nameFunction`. So when you the handler is invoked `myFunction` checks the status, sees `status` is `false` switches it to `true` and then when `nameFunction` runs, `status` is now `true`, where it should have been `false`.\r\n * you can extract the code to change the `status` value and only call it from one place.

Here is an example. \r\n\r\n  public class MainThreadExecutor implements Executor {\r\n    \r\n        private final Handler handler = new Handler(Looper.getMainLooper());\r\n    \r\n        @Override\r\n        public void execute(Runnable runnable) {\r\n            handler.post(runnable);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    public class YourClass {\r\n    \r\n        MutableLiveData first_MutableLiveData = new MutableLiveData&lt;Data&gt;();\r\n        MutableLiveData second_MutableLiveData = new MutableLiveData&lt;Data&gt;();\r\n        \r\n        \r\n        private final Executor executor;\r\n    \r\n        public YourClass(Executor executor) {\r\n            this.executor = executor;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    \r\n        void foo(){\r\n            \r\n            executor.execute(new Runnable(){\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void run() {\r\n                    first_MutableLiveData.setValue(newData);\r\n                    second_MutableLiveData.setValue(newData);\r\n                }\r\n            });\r\n           \r\n        }\r\n    \r\n    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322456/post-multiple-mutablelivedata-have-no-order/58323069#58323069","title":"Post multiple MutableLiveData have no order"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1950,"user_id":1042124,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f41bd8db2424f7895f2d19df47253e82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user6327816","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1042124/user6327816"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570713557,"post_id":58323789,"comment_id":103006396,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322456/post-multiple-mutablelivedata-have-no-order/58323789#comment103006396_58323789"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":7673995,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/drwga.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"ohad.k.k","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7673995/ohad-k-k"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570713209,"creation_date":1570713209,"answer_id":58323789,"question_id":58322456,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58323789","body_markdown":"So apparently when I changed the observer&#39;s order on the fragment they arrived in the order I needed them to be.

If your toolchain is correctly configured, it&#39;s just fine to have that literal arrow in your code.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to avoid it, you can use a unicode escape for it instead:\r\n\r\n    const nwarr = &quot;\\u2196&quot;;\r\n    if (first.innerHTML.indexOf(nwarr) !== -1) {\r\n        first.innerHTML = first.innerHTML.substring(0, first.innerHTML.length - 7);\r\n    }\r\n    first.innerHTML += &#39;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nwarr;&#39;; // &lt;== Did you mean &amp;searr; here? The opposite of nwarr?\r\n\r\nLive example (using `&amp;searr;` in the replacement:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const first = document.getElementById(&quot;first&quot;);\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n        const nwarr = &quot;\\u2196&quot;;\r\n        if (first.innerHTML.indexOf(nwarr) !== -1) {\r\n            first.innerHTML = first.innerHTML.substring(0, first.innerHTML.length - 7);\r\n        }\r\n        first.innerHTML += &#39;&amp;nbsp;&amp;searr;&#39;;\r\n    }, 800);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;span id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Foo&amp;nbsp;&amp;nwarr;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTwo side notes:\r\n\r\n1\\. To replace things, I&#39;d use `replace` rather than `substring` and `+=`, not least so you don&#39;t have magic numbers (13, 7) in your code:\r\n\r\n    first.innerHTML = first.innerHTML.replace(/\\&amp;nbsp;\\u2196/g, &quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;searr;&quot;);\r\n\r\nyou might even allow for some browsers to use an character entity rather than character for it:\r\n\r\n    first.innerHTML = first.innerHTML.replace(/\\&amp;nbsp;(?:\\&amp;nwarr;|\\u2196)/g, &quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;searr;&quot;);\r\n\r\nLive example (using `&amp;searr;` in the replacement:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const first = document.getElementById(&quot;first&quot;);\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n        first.innerHTML = first.innerHTML.replace(/\\&amp;nbsp;(?:\\&amp;nwarr;|\\u2196)/g, &quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;searr;&quot;);\r\n    }, 800);\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;span id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Foo&amp;nbsp;&amp;nwarr;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n2\\. I would avoid textual manipulation of `innerHTML`. If you assign to it, even when assigning back what it already had, it tears down all of the elements (and other nodes) within the element you&#39;re doing it on, and creates new, replacement elements and nodes.\r\n\r\nFor instance, you could spin through the text nodes:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: false babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const first = document.getElementById(&quot;first&quot;);\r\n\r\n    setTimeout(() =&gt; {\r\n        handleReplacement(first);\r\n    }, 800);\r\n\r\n    function handleReplacement(el) {\r\n        for (let child = el.firstChild; child; child = child.nextSibling) {\r\n            if (child.nodeType === 1) { // Element\r\n                handleReplacement(child);\r\n            } else if (child.nodeType === 3) { // Text\r\n                child.nodeValue = child.nodeValue.replace(/\\u00A0\\u2196/g, &quot;\\u00A0\\u2198&quot;);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;span id=&quot;first&quot;&gt;Foo&amp;nbsp;&amp;nwarr;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322435/javascript-indexof-matching-html-symbols/58322555#58322555","title":"Javascript .indexOf matching HTML symbols"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":37091,"user_id":1016716,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c83d772b1c065603c7f20975d8d3552?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Mr Lister","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1016716/mr-lister"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570712724,"post_id":58323451,"comment_id":103005868,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58322435/javascript-indexof-matching-html-symbols/58323451#comment103005868_58323451"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9892232,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/192ad7cccfd3bdc214338a33e471a4f7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Norsak","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9892232/norsak"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570712218,"creation_date":1570712218,"answer_id":58323451,"question_id":58322435,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58323451","body_markdown":"Based on T.J.
