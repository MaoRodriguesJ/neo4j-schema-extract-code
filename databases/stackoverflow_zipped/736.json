am trying to parse xml and filter nodes which do not meet the certain criteria (do not have an id attribute or this attribute is empty)\r\n\r\nMy xml looks like rather simple:\r\n\r\n    &lt;node/&gt;            &lt;!-- not ok node--&gt;\r\n    &lt;node id = &quot;&quot;/&gt;    &lt;!-- not ok node--&gt;\r\n    &lt;node id=&quot;&quot;&gt;       &lt;!-- not ok node--&gt;\r\n        &lt;type&gt;4&lt;/type&gt;\r\n    &lt;/node&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;node id = &quot;1&quot;/&gt;   &lt;!-- OK node--&gt;\r\n\r\nSo there are 3 wrong nodes which have an empty id tag or do not have it at all, and 1 OK node with correct id tag. Parsing and filtering code is as follows (Java&#39;s `Optional` is used, the code does not work and produces errors):\r\n\r\n    try (StaxStreamProcessor processor = new \r\n         StaxStreamProcessor(Files.newInputStream(Paths.get(graphConfigPath)))){\r\n\t\r\n\t  Set&lt;Node&gt; nodes = new HashSet&lt;&gt;();\r\n\t  XMLStreamReader reader = processor.getReader();\r\n\t  Loggers.debug(&quot;started parsing&quot;);\r\n\t  while (reader.hasNext()) {\r\n\t\t switch (reader.getLocalName()) {\r\n\t\t\tcase NODE_TAG:\r\n\t\t\t\tOptional.ofNullable(reader.getAttributeValue(null, ID_ATTR))\r\n                    \t.filter(nodeId -&gt; nodes.add(parseNode(reader))) // error here: Unhandled exception: javax.xml.stream.XMLStreamException\r\n                    \t.orElse(Loggers.debug(&quot;Node with empty id attribute&quot;)); //error here: orElse (java.lang.String) in Optional cannot be applied to (Void)\r\n\t\t  }\r\n\t   }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nSo if the Node is wrong, it should not be put into `nodes` collection, but log message should be written. If the node is OK, it goes into collection without log messages. Any idea how to fix it would be welcome. Thank you.\r\n\r\n**UPD_1**\r\nFound a solution how to collect correct nodes (which have id present and not empty):\r\n\r\n    Optional.ofNullable(parseNode(reader))\r\n            .filter(node -&gt; node.getId() != null &amp;&amp; node.getId() != &quot;&quot; )  \r\n            .ifPresent(nodes::add);\r\n\r\nbut how to get the other ones (wrong nodes and write a log about them)? It says it is not possible to write anything after `ifPresent()`\r\n\r\nThank you.\r\n\r\n**UPD_2**\r\n\r\nfinally managed to solve the issue with `spring-data` (thx to [THIS][1]) post.\r\n\r\n    Optional opt = Optional.ofNullable(parseNode(reader))\r\n                           .filter(node -&gt; node.getId() != null &amp;&amp; node.getId() != &quot;&quot; );\r\n                                \r\n    //Runnable notFoundAction = () -&gt; Loggers.warning(&quot;Node with empty id attribute&quot;);\r\n\r\n     Optionals.ifPresentOrElse(\r\n                                opt,\r\n                                nodes::add,\r\n                                () -&gt; Loggers.warning(&quot;Node with empty id attribute&quot;)\r\n                            );\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23773024/functional-style-of-java-8s-optional-ifpresent-and-if-not-present/56131331#56131331","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367089/java-optional-filter-xml-tags-with-certain-conditions","title":"Java Optional filter xml tags with certain conditions"},{"tags":["c","linux","signals","sigaction"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":6265,"user_id":2554472,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1119155584/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mark Plotnick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2554472/mark-plotnick"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571082676,"post_id":58367088,"comment_id":103114551,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367088/siginfo-field-si-signo-appears-to-contain-a-random-value#comment103114551_58367088"},{"owner":{"reputation":3019,"user_id":877329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b5c9fa7b8fa8139c1330b5fbbd5f934?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user877329","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/877329/user877329"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":6265,"user_id":2554472,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1119155584/picture?type=large","display_name":"Mark Plotnick","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2554472/mark-plotnick"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571153184,"post_id":58367088,"comment_id":103141561,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367088/siginfo-field-si-signo-appears-to-contain-a-random-value#comment103141561_58367088"}],"owner":{"reputation":3019,"user_id":877329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b5c9fa7b8fa8139c1330b5fbbd5f934?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user877329","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/877329/user877329"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3019,"user_id":877329,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b5c9fa7b8fa8139c1330b5fbbd5f934?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user877329","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/877329/user877329"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571070230,"creation_date":1570995142,"last_edit_date":1571070230,"question_id":58367088,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58367088","body_markdown":"I am trying to get things out of the siginfo_t struct.

you can&#39;t just start accessing the raw bits of a `BITMAP` object through an `HBITMAP` (as returned by `CreateCompatibleBitmap`). `HBITMAP` is just a handle, as the name suggests. It&#39;s not a pointer in the classic &quot;C&quot; sense that it points to the beginning of the array. Handles are like indirect pointers.\r\n\r\n`GetDIBits` is the appropriate solution to get the raw, device-independent pixel array from a bitmap that you can iterate through. But you&#39;ll still need to use the code you have to get the screen bitmap in the first place. Essentially, you want something like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26238387). Of course, you&#39;ll need to translate it into C#, but that shouldn&#39;t be difficult, since you already know how to call WinAPI functions.\r\n\r\nNote that you do not need to call `GetDesktopWindow` or `GetWindowDC`. Just pass `NULL` as the handle to `GetDC`; it has the same effect of returning a screen DC, which you can then use to create a compatible bitmap. In general, you should almost never call `GetDesktopWindow`.

In that case, you can use the cursor in a reverse query, which is the original query with each sort order reversed. The reverse\r\n&gt; query can modify the start cursor, end cursor, offset, and limit.\r\n\r\nSo it seems like the last sort field has to be a key AND another index with all sorts reversed is required. This will consume two composite indexes.\r\n\r\nOne way to avoid this I can think of is to store all the cursors as a stack as the pagination is happening. This can be done on the client-side. Then as the user is navigating back or jumping to a specific previous page, the associated cursor can be used to always go forward. Say you have a page size of 25. Then you would have a cursor generated at 25, 50, 75 and 100. Then if the user wants to go back to 50, you would pick the associated cursor and generate rows from 50 to 75 which is iterating forward only.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367051/ndb-datastore-query-cursor-and-indexing-issues/58368658#58368658","title":"ndb datastore query cursor and indexing issues"}],"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":3647998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19f28ae3788b2a808469423eff837236?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack tileman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3647998/jack-tileman"},"last_editor":{"reputation":108,"user_id":3647998,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":33,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/19f28ae3788b2a808469423eff837236?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jack tileman","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3647998/jack-tileman"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571030900,"creation_date":1570994925,"last_edit_date":1570996457,"question_id":58367051,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58367051","body_markdown":"We are using ndb Datastore, python, standard google app engine.

This is because terms in Prolog are not expressions that reduce on their own—this is partly why you need to use `is/2` to reduce an arithmetic expression to a value. Even things that are purely arithmetic are just terms in Prolog:\r\n\r\n    ?- X = 16*3 + 4.\r\n    X = 16*3+4.\r\n\r\nThis is not some special behavior of `=/2` in Prolog. This is how terms are made. Reducing the value requires deploying another predicate:\r\n\r\n    ?- X is 16*3+4.\r\n    X = 52.\r\n\r\nSo what you appear to have done is assumed that your `neg` operator has induced a two-argument predicate for reducing it and that your `or` operator has induced a three argument predicate for reducing it. Actually neither of these things has happened, all that your operator declarations do is allow you to create terms like the one above, `neg a or b`. So you still need to create a separate predicate for evaluating them, which is where your semantics enter the picture. So let&#39;s implement an `eval/2` predicate that converts your term into the result value you want:\r\n\r\n    eval(neg X, [neg X|Result])   :- \r\n        eval(X, Result).\r\n\r\n    eval(X or Y, [X or Y|Result]) :- \r\n        eval(X, R1), \r\n        eval(Y, R2), \r\n        append(R1, R2, Result).\r\n\r\n    eval(X, [X]) :- atomic(X).\r\n\r\nThe key idea here is to match what your operators give you and peel one layer off at a time, recursively calling the rest. Our base case is &quot;atomic values&quot; which is to say atoms like `a`.\r\n    \r\nThis gives us what you&#39;re looking for:\r\n\r\n    ?- eval(neg (a or b), R).\r\n    R = [neg (a or b), a or b, a, b] \r\n\r\nNote that `is/2` is an operator. You could also define an operator which &quot;does work&quot; by declaring the operator and then supplying rules for their application. That won&#39;t help you in this case, because your examples for `neg` and `or` require you to retain structure rather than discard it. `is/2`, on the other hand, assumes the structure exists on the right argument and reduces it to a value for the left. You could do something similar, by say making `eval/2` an operator, in which case the operator is used on the left side of the `:-`, like so:\r\n\r\n    [Neg X|R] eval (neg X) :- R eval X.\r\n\r\nHowever, I find this kind of hard to handle and would definitely avoid it unless it ushered in more clarity.\r\n\r\nBy the way, you will most likely want to replace `xfx` in your `op/3` call with either `xfy` or `yfx`, since constructions like `a or b or c` will not work with `xfx` due to an operator priority clash. With `xfy`, it will be parsed as `a or (b or c)` and with `yfx` it will be parsed as `(a or b) or c` which is probably more helpful. And also, if you intend _always_ to parenthesize what you use `neg` with, then you do not need to declare an operator for it—the purpose of a unary operator is just to allow you to skip the parens (and control how much of what follows is consumed by it.)\r\n\r\nHope this helps!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367026/prolog-define-propositional-logic-statement-operators-and-add-arguments-to-list/58379332#58379332","title":"Prolog: Define propositional

Here&#39;s an example: \r\n```\r\npublic static function test()\r\n{\r\n    // Method implementation\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore documentation here : [php static functions][1]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/static-function-in-php/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367025/php-how-to-create-function-which-will-be-accessible-with-double-colon-scop/58367111#58367111","title":"PHP: How to create function which will be accessible with :: (double colon, scope resolution) in another classes"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":1736534,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/OzSik.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"neologyc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1736534/neologyc"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":25,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570995265,"accepted_answer_id":58367100,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570995289,"creation_date":1570994713,"question_id":58367025,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58367025","body_markdown":"I&#180;m trying to create a logging class which will be accessible in all Classes around the PHP app by\r\n\r\n    logger::log(something);\r\n\r\n \r\nand this will add next row into my logfile (the part with inserting into file is easy for me).

main problem with your code seems to lie with understanding the problem. I took at look at the Github page you linked (I noticed your assignment is due tomorrow -- please do not wait until the last minute to ask for help in the future, and always ask the teacher first, rather than some stranger on Stack Overflow). Let&#39;s break down the assignment properly.\r\n\r\nThe player starts with cash (in your case, 2 units), so we know how to initialize `startCash`, which you&#39;ve done properly\r\n\r\nHis goal is to get to 10 units or bust, so we know the upper and lower limits that define the parameters for his participation in the game. In other words, he only plays while he has &gt; 0 and &lt; 10 units. An outer loop checking to see if he has enough cash is pointless.\r\n\r\nWhile those conditions are true, he plays a coin flipping game, where 50 or less is a loss of one unit and 51 or more is a win of one unit. Each time he flips, we increment a counter so we know how many coin flips he conducted to get to either 0 or 10.\r\n\r\nNotice how I&#39;ve rephrased the question: While cash &gt; 0 and cash &lt; 10, flip coin. If flip &lt; 50, player loss, else win. Increment counter. That&#39;s all there is to it, all in one loop.\r\n\r\nYou confused yourself by adding an outer loop which you don&#39;t need at all -- maybe you put it there to keep flipping while the player has money, but it&#39;s redundant because your `do...while` is checking both the lower and upper limits for whether the game should be played. That outer loop is also running 5 times, but what if it takes more than 5 trials to bust or get 10?\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve simplified the code here by basically rearranging what you already had. Compare what you have to what I have and you&#39;ll see that I more or less just stripped away the useless outer loop. Run the code a few times and you&#39;ll see that you already had more or less the correct logic before you shot yourself in the foot.\r\n\r\n    import java.security.SecureRandom;\r\n    \r\n    public class Homework\r\n    {\r\n      public static void main(String[] args)\r\n      {\r\n        int startCash = 2;\r\n        int endCash = 10;\r\n        int currentCash = startCash;\r\n        int counter = 0;\r\n    \r\n        while(currentCash &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; currentCash &lt; endCash)\r\n        {\r\n          SecureRandom randomNumber = new SecureRandom();\r\n          int number = randomNumber.nextInt(101);\r\n    \r\n          if(number &lt;= 50)\r\n          {\r\n            // lost\r\n            currentCash--;\r\n          }\r\n          else\r\n          {\r\n            // won\r\n            currentCash++;\r\n          }\r\n    \r\n          counter++;\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Current Cash: &quot; + currentCash);\r\n        System.out.println(&quot;Trials: &quot; + counter);\r\n    \r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe only &quot;major&quot; change other than removing the extra loop is changing your `do...while` into a `while` loop. The difference is that a `do...while` will always run at least once because the exit condition isn&#39;t checked until after the code block runs, which doesn&#39;t seem correct because what if `startCash` is already 0 or 10? The `while` loop checks the condition before running the code block, so if the player is ineligible to play (too much or too little cash), then he doesn&#39;t play.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58367024/having-a-problem-with-java-for-game-simulation/58370861#58370861","title":"having a problem with java for game simulation"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12210758,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7355bdec4587288f9b2a98555733865e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"aputamkon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12210758/aputamkon"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571049583,"creation_date":1571049583,"answer_id":58375029,"question_id":58367024,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58375029","body_markdown":"well i figured it all out just took a while and lots of versions. here is the final code. most of the earlier code was to see where the numbers where going. \r\n{import java.util.Scanner;

I&#39;ve setup a Zabbix docker environment with a server and proxy running no problem. The agent container that is connected monitors the docker container in which the agent lives. This is great, but I need to monitor the actual host the container is on. I installed the agent on the host but now I&#39;m stuck trying to connect the host network to the proxy and vice versa. This situation can be applied to any application really, not just Zabbix. For example, if I wanted to access a web server on the host from a container, how would I go about doing this? I feel it is unnecessary to be exposing ports publicly for this etc.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if anyone has any suggestions! Much appreciated, thank youl.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366994/accessing-the-host-network-of-a-docker-container-linux","title":"Accessing the host network of a docker container

Another disadvantage is that each query will be annotated with this attribute even if you don&#39;t use it, but this can be solved by customizing the manager&#39;s queryset.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366953/how-to-implement-sorting-in-django-admin-for-calculated-model-properties-without/58408786#58408786","title":"How to implement sorting in Django Admin for calculated model properties without writing the logic twice?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":14135,"user_id":7414939,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ri4Jz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Moutafis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7414939/john-moutafis"},"last_editor":{"reputation":14135,"user_id":7414939,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ri4Jz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Moutafis","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7414939/john-moutafis"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":false,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1571228160,"last_edit_date":1571228160,"creation_date":1571221221,"answer_id":58411009,"question_id":58366953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58411009","body_markdown":"**TL/DR: Yes your solution seems to follow the only way that makes sense.**\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\nWell, what you have composed here seems to be the recommended way from the sources you list in your question and for good reason.\r\n\r\n**What is the good reason though?**&lt;br&gt;\r\nI haven&#39;t found a definitive, in the codebase, answer for that but I imagine that it has to do with the way `@property` decorator works in Python. \r\n\r\nWhen we set a property with the decorator then we cannot add attributes to it and since the `admin_order_field` is an attribute then we can&#39;t have that in there. That statement seems to be reinforced from the [Django Admin&#39;s `list_display` documentation][1] where the following passage exists:\r\n\r\n&gt; Elements of `list_display` can also be properties. Please note however, that due to the way properties work in Python, setting `short_description` on a property **is only possible when using the `property()` function and not with the `@property` decorator.**\r\n\r\nThat quote in combination with this QA: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17267802/attributeerror-property-object-has-no-attribute-admin-order-field seems to explain why it is not possible to have an orderable from a model property directly into the admin panel.\r\n\r\n&lt;hr&gt;\r\n\r\n*That explained (probably?) it is time for some mental gymnastics!!*\r\n\r\nIn the [previously mentioned part of the documentation][1] we can also see that the `admin_order_field` can accept query expressions since version 2.1:\r\n\r\n&gt; Query expressions may be used in admin_order_field. For example:\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt;     from django.db.models import Value\r\n&gt;     from django.db.models.functions import Concat\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;     class Person(models.Model):\r\n&gt;         first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n&gt;         last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\r\n&gt;     \r\n&gt;         def full_name(self):\r\n&gt;             return self.first_name + &#39; &#39; + self.last_name\r\n&gt;         full_name.admin_order_field = Concat(&#39;first_name&#39;, Value(&#39; &#39;), &#39;last_name&#39;)\r\n\r\nThat in conjunction with the previous part about the `property()` method, allows us to refactor your code and essentially move the `annotation` part to the model:\r\n\r\n    class De(models.Model):\r\n        ...\r\n        def calculate_s_d(self):\r\n            if self.fr:\r\n                return self.de\r\n            else:\r\n                return self.gd + self.na\r\n        \r\n        calculate_s_d.admin_order_field = Case(\r\n            When(fr=True, then=&#39;s_d&#39;),\r\n            When(fr=False, then=F(&#39;gd&#39;) + F(&#39;na&#39;)),\r\n            default=Value(0),\r\n            output_field=IntegerField(),\r\n        )\r\n        \r\n        s_d = property(calculate_s_d)\r\n\r\nFinally, on the `admin.py` we only need:\r\n\r\n    class DeAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\r\n        list_display = (&quot;[...]&quot;, &quot;s_d&quot;)\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  [1]: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366953/how-to-implement-sorting-in-django-admin-for-calculated-model-properties-without/58411009#58411009","title":"How to implement sorting in Django Admin for calculated model properties without writing the logic twice?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":12464,"user_id":1783237,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":70,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7e2e43627aaa33e772cb7e7227c59a7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GwynBleidD","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1783237/gwynbleidd"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571666615,"creation_date":1571666615,"answer_id":58487954,"question_id":58366953,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58487954","body_markdown":"Unfortunately, this is impossible in current stable Django version (up to 2.2) due to Django admin not fetching `admin_order_field` from object properties.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it will be possible in upcoming Django version (3.0 and up) which should be released on 2nd of December.\r\n\r\nThe way to achieve it:\r\n\r\n    class De(models.Model):\r\n    \r\n        fr = models.BooleanField(&quot;[...]&quot;)\r\n        de = models.SmallIntegerField(&quot;[...]&quot;)\r\n        gd = models.SmallIntegerField(&quot;[...]&quot;)\r\n        na = models.SmallIntegerField(&quot;[...]&quot;)\r\n        #

I am not sure if they are suitable as they may assume a normal distribution.  My distributions are not normal. \r\n\r\nIt would make sense if there is a pre-packaged Python / Scipy package which does this job.  \r\n\r\nFor example, I found this [Confidence Interval Python solution][1] which I am going to try, but I don&#39;t know if it will work for non-normal distributions.  If it replicates my previous results, then great and I&#39;ll update query as solved.  My solution works but is too slow at the moment.  \r\n\r\nThe link I refer to takes only a 1D file, so I don&#39;t think it will work.

The warning message in your question means that you set up the SDK CLI with user account credentials (`gcloud auth login`). I recommend switching to service account credentials.\r\n\r\nThis command will setup the CLI with a service account. You will need your Project ID and service account JSON file.\r\n\r\n    gcloud auth activate-service-account test@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com --key-file=service_account.json\r\n\r\nI wrote an article that goes into detail on how to set up the CLI:\r\n\r\n[Setting up Gcloud with Service Account Credentials][1]\r\n\r\nWhy is Google giving you a warning:\r\n\r\n - Authorizing User Credentials requires more effort on Google&#39;s backend services.\r\n - User Account credentials require human interaction to create.\r\n - The Refresh Token is often stored by software on the client or backends. This creates a security hole.\r\n - Software should use machine-to-machine authentication with limited permissions (scopes). User credentials typically are issued with too many permissions for the API calls being made. This again is a security issue.\r\n - Google has decided that User Credentials will not be allowed to have the scopes required to access many Google Cloud Platform services. This is very apparent when creating OAuth Clients and you receive a big warning about verification. There is a **strong risk** that Google will stop allowing user credentials for cloud services. It is better to use the supported and official method of a service account and not face this issue in the future.\r\n\r\nHowever, given the above details, your use case is providing your users with credentials. This is not a good idea. I would continue to use User Credentials talking to your web frontend. Your web frontend uses a service account that the user never sees and provides the final service (API) access.\r\n\r\n[UPDATE]\r\n\r\nI just noticed your comment that you are developing your own CLI. Without more details on what projects/services this CLI will be accessing you might consider using user credentials that talk to your service which issues an Access Token to the user. This token is only valid for one hour. You can support refreshing this token in your code. This gives you the ability to use user authentication, control service account usage and still maintain good security. Notice that I am trying to steer you away from distributing service account files directly to users. If these users are your own employees, this is less of a problem. For people not under your control think carefully.\r\n\r\n[END UPDATE]\r\n\r\nI will try to provide details and advice on your questions. Do consider my previous comments while deciding the best strategy for you.\r\n\r\n&gt; In the other case, (service account specific credentials) I assume I\r\n&gt; will have to provide instructions to each developer to issue a json\r\n&gt; file that corresponds to a service account with the exact same\r\n&gt; permission as his/hers.\r\n\r\nIf I were to write an application that used service account credentials, I would create a method to load/install the credentials. Just provide a file and tell them to do this step in the program. However, you have an issue. It is not a good idea to distribute the same service account to all users. How do you handle revoking, etc? Google Cloud Platform service accounts are not designed to be distributed uniquely to more than a few dozen or hundreds users per project.\r\n\r\n&gt; And what about the update process?\r\n\r\nService account credential JSON key files do not expire.

We recommend that most server\r\n&gt; applications use service accounts instead. If your application\r\n&gt; continues to use end user credentials from Cloud SDK, you might\r\n&gt; receive a &quot;quota exceeded&quot; or &quot;API not enabled&quot; error. For more\r\n&gt; information about service accounts, see\r\n&gt; https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/  \r\n&gt; warnings.warn(_CLOUD_SDK_CREDENTIALS_WARNING)\r\n\r\nIf I use app default creds, this makes it easy since each end user the app will be distributed to, will have this `.json` file a source of truth for his/her auth process. However, the app may encounter the above `quota exceeded` error.\r\n\r\nIn the other case, (service account specific credentials) I assume I will have to provide instructions to each developer to issue a json file that corresponds to a service account with the exact same permission as his/hers. And what about the update process? What happens each time a user gets assigned / revoked some permissions? How this json stays in sync?\r\n\r\nAny advice about this would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-python\r\n  [2]: https://www.jhanley.com/google-cloud-iam-listing-projects/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366923/best-auth-strategy-for-gcp-client-tool","title":"Best auth strategy for GCP client tool"},{"tags":["vue.js","vuetify.js","vue-cli-3","sass-loader"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":188,"user_id":3394654,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":30,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4fRHp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"J.

A few things:\r\n\r\nClass names should start with upper case letters, like `String`, variable and method names should use the camel case naming convention: `myVariable`, `myMethod`. An exception is when a variable is constant, full upper case name in that case: \r\n\r\n     final in MY_CONSTANT = 3;\r\n\r\nAlways give clear names for your variables and methods, so it&#39;s possible to know what they do just by reading the name.\r\n\r\nComment your code! This is very important, as good, informative comments will help you and others understand the code. You can also take a look at (Javadoc comments).[https://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_documentation.htm]\r\n\r\nYou already mentioned object oriented programming, so don&#39;t be afraid to make classes for the entities in your project, like `Customer` or `Device`. You can combine the classes to better model your Computer Repair Shop:\r\n\r\npublic class Customer {\r\n\r\n     private String name;\r\n     private List&lt;Device&gt; devices; //all devices of the customer \r\n     \r\n     public Customer(String name) {\r\n          this.name = name;\r\n          devices = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     public void registerDevice(Device d) {\r\n          devices.add(d); \r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\nThis is just a stupid little example of course, but you get the point.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58366885/learning-code-conventions-while-learning-programing/58367155#58367155","title":"Learning code conventions while learning programing"}],"owner":{"reputation":52,"user_id":9361512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-mdSj8zp9bAU/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAD48/nnLyQnq1VB8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Zoran Jankov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9361512/zoran-jankov"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1570998115,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570995516,"creation_date":1570993554,"question_id":58366885,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58366885","body_markdown":"I&#39;m self learning Java now and I have only vary basic knowledge of object oriented programing.
