When I save a JSON generated using JSON.net to txt file and then read it and then send it to Shopify&#39;s create product API, it works fine. However, if I just save the JSON to string and send post request directly, I get a 502 gateway error from Shopify. This happens only when creating certain products, where the JSON payload is somewhat bigger than normal. On other products, just saving JSON to a string and then sending to Shopify works OK. Weirdly, when I save the JSON to file from C#, then read that file a few lines below in the same code, and use that content as JSON string and send a post request, it again doesn&#39;t work. What do you think could be the issue?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the JSON generated using JSON.net which works OK when read from file (https://pastebin.com/9SKFPjGJ)\r\n\r\n    var jsonContent = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObject);\r\n    using (var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $&quot;https://{shopifySlug}.myshopify.com/admin/products/{originalShopifyProductId}.json&quot;))\r\n    {\r\n        requestMessage.AddShopifyHeaders(shopifyAccessToken); // just a method for adding necessary shopify headers\r\n        requestMessage.Content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        response = await client.SendAsync(requestMessage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIts getting hard for me to know the reason.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what works:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode that works:  \r\njson.txt was generated using this separately:\r\n\r\n\r\n    System.IO.File.WriteAllText(&quot;E:\\\\json.txt&quot;,JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObject));\r\n\r\n(Note that if the above line of code is inserted before the code below in the same file, then the code below doesn&#39;t work, i.e. the file has to be saved separately for it to work).\r\n\r\nAnd then, just reading the JSON from file and sending that in the POST request works. Code below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var jsonContent = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(&quot;E:\\\\json.txt&quot;);\r\n    using (var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $&quot;https://{shopifySlug}.myshopify.com/admin/products/{originalShopifyProductId}.json&quot;))\r\n    {\r\n        requestMessage.AddShopifyHeaders(shopifyAccessToken); // just a method for adding necessary shopify headers\r\n        requestMessage.Content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        response = await client.SendAsync(requestMessage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the not working code at the very top works OK for smaller JSON payloads like this one https://pastebin.com/RhYjVuvv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418803/issue-while-creating-product-using-shopify-api","title":"Issue while creating product using Shopify API"},{"tags":["ssl","gnutls"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259400,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185376,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185376_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259526,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185430,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185430_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259943,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185583_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571260112,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185628,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185628_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571264092,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103186935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103186935_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571286815,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103191708,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103191708_58420351"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"comment_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571253658,"creation_date":1571253658,"answer_id":58420351,"question_id":58418802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420351","body_markdown":"From https://gnutls.org/news.html:\r\n\r\n&gt;

I kept looking online but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a correspondence between library version and protocol standard. So to provide more clarification, here is what I see\r\n\r\n    $ ls -lah /usr/lib/libgnutls.so\r\n    /usr/lib/libgnutls.so -&gt; ibgnutls.so.30.22.0\r\n\r\nFrom this I can see that my library is at version `30.22.0` (we can talk more about library versioning later if you want). What I can&#39;t figure out is what protocol version does this library support. Is it `TLS 1.2` or `TLS 1.3` or both? To find out what `TLS` source code version I have installed I downloaded a dev version of `gnutls` and looked into `/usr/include/gnutls/gnutls.h`. Found the following in there\r\n\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION &quot;3.6.4&quot;\r\n    \r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR 3\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR 6\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_PATCH 4\r\n    \r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER 0x030604\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it looks like I&#39;m using version 3.6.4 of the source code.

If the international code is invalid first \r\n2. If the actual number is invalid when the international phone is valid\r\n\r\nBut when using this on the backend side / with other apps, we don&#39;t really care about this and we don&#39;t really want to see the same errors (just that the `normalized_phone` is valid or not).\r\n\r\nSo far we&#39;ve been taking advantage of ActiveModel to easily serialize errors (`model.errors.map(&amp;:errors_to_json)`). The problem is we have a different representation of the error on the frontend side (because the `phone` is serialized as 2 different attributes) and a backend/DB representation (a single &quot;normalized_phone&quot;)\r\n\r\nWe have an edition service that is responsible for updating various user attributes including the phone and handling various draft states. Basically our main logic call behaves like this\r\n\r\nOur logic is currently like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n# controller\r\ndef update\r\n  transform_client_side_attributes_to_server_side_attributes\r\n  edition_service.new(model, params).call() # will call amongst others model.validate after assigning new attributes\r\n  render_json_using_activemodel_errors_for(model)\r\n  # =&gt; \r\n  # { data: {...},\r\n  #   errors: [...], # each ActiveModel error is serialized there\r\n  # }\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef transform_client_side_attributes_to_server_side_attributes\r\n  international_prefix = params.xxx[:international_prefix]\r\n  number_without_prefix = params.xxx[:number_without_prefix] \r\n  if valid_prefix?(international_prefix)\r\n    if valid_number_for_prefix(number_without_prefix, international_prefix)\r\n      params[:normalized_phone] = normalize(number_without_prefix, international_prefix)\r\n    else\r\n      model.errors.add(:number_without_prefix, :invalid)\r\n    end\r\n  else \r\n    model.errors.add(:international_prefix, xxx)\r\n    return\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, since we have frontend specific errors, we are adding activemodel errors directly on the model as it is very convenient for serializing. The problem is, the edition_service will call at some point `model.validate` and that will have the effect of clearing other validation errors.\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to prevent clearing errors when running validations ?** So that we could stack some validations defined on the model itself and some frontend-specific validations ?\r\n\r\nI understand that ActiveModel might not be designed for this specific scenario, but it feels like it should be able to adapt easily.\r\n\r\nShould I just reimplement a `model.validate_without_clearing_errors` method or maybe switch to another approach ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418757/rails-and-activemodel-errors-how-to-render-frontend-vs-backend-specific-errors","title":"Rails and activemodel errors - how to render frontend vs backend specific errors"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":231746,"user_id":1447675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziYmO.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nina Scholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1447675/nina-scholz"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571247172,"post_id":58418756,"comment_id":103180057,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map#comment103180057_58418756"},{"owner":{"reputation":3380,"user_id":3662110,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDJ9n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmargolisvt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3662110/jmargolisvt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247377,"post_id":58418756,"comment_id":103180145,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map#comment103180145_58418756"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247520,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180213,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180213_58418856"},{"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":11541562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922e908e17f25d44d646a91484398994?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"f278f1b2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541562/f278f1b2"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247582,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180239_58418856"},{"owner":{"reputation":788,"user_id":6624953,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jv5IW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"frobinsonj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6624953/frobinsonj"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247632,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180257_58418856"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":11541562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922e908e17f25d44d646a91484398994?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"f278f1b2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541562/f278f1b2"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571247403,"creation_date":1571247403,"answer_id":58418856,"question_id":58418756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418856","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const pqr = [\r\n      { name: &quot;R&quot;, age: &quot;20&quot;

For example, if products with `pk_product` 1,2,3 have been deleted and my record `pk_product == 4` has an index of `1` (first in dbf file), how can I get the value `1` in the code, doing something like `record.index == 1`?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418746/how-to-get-record-index-in-python-dbf-lib","title":"How to get record index in Python DBF lib"},{"tags":["python","beautifulsoup"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":56280,"user_id":6241235,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCxzx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"QHarr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6241235/qharr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571250034,"post_id":58418744,"comment_id":103181276,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python#comment103181276_58418744"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336768,"post_id":58419596,"comment_id":103217140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#comment103217140_58419596"},{"owner":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336806,"post_id":58419596,"comment_id":103217159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#comment103217159_58419596"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571250866,"last_edit_date":1571250866,"creation_date":1571250500,"answer_id":58419596,"question_id":58418744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58419596","body_markdown":"## Your code updated:\r\n\r\n - Use `attrs` to return all the attributes\r\n  - `{&#39;class&#39;: [&#39;lvpic&#39;, &#39;pic&#39;, &#39;img&#39;, &#39;left&#39;], &#39;iid&#39;: &#39;183988596953&#39;}`\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_id(urls):\r\n    for url in urls:\r\n        session = requests.session()\r\n        response = session.get(url)\r\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)\r\n        return soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, {&quot;class&quot;: &quot;lvpic pic img left&quot;}).attrs[&#39;iid&#39;]\r\n\r\niid = find_id(urls)\r\n\r\nprint(iid)\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;183988596953&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If you want all `iid`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_id(urls):\r\n    for url in urls:\r\n        session = requests.session()\r\n        response = session.get(url)\r\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)\r\n        div = s.find_all(&quot;div&quot;, attrs={&#39;class&#39;: &#39;lvpic pic img left&#39;})\r\n        return [iid.attrs[&#39;iid&#39;] for iid in div]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#58419596","title":"extract a html ID from inside a tag using beautiful soup python"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58419596,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571250866,"creation_date":1571246914,"question_id":58418744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418744","body_markdown":"I am trying to extract only an iid code in html so that i can append it to a url and open the page I need. \r\n\r\nI can find the tag I need by specifying the class of the tag.

layer is the electrical (or light etc) that allows two points (usually the hub/switch/router and the host) to communicate.  On top of that is the protocol such as how mac addresses are distributed, packet formats etc.\r\n\r\nThe OSI model has an opinion on how to define this as well. From:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_architecture\r\n\r\n```OSI model\r\nLayer\tProtocol data unit (PDU)\tFunction[6]\r\nHost layers\t\r\n7\tApplication\tData\tHigh-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access\r\n6\tPresentation\tTranslation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption\r\n5\tSession\tManaging communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes\r\n4\tTransport\tSegment, Datagram\tReliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing\r\nMedia layers\r\n3\tNetwork\tPacket\tStructuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control\r\n2\tData link\tFrame\tReliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer\r\n1\tPhysical\tSymbol\tTransmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Link layer is layer 2, and specifies only that bytes flow between the two nodes, but not the format of the bytes -- that&#39;s layer 3.\r\n\r\nSome of your subsequent questions:\r\n\r\n&gt;Suppose you have an office with computers connected on a LAN. Why can&#39;t all the computers act as their own routers and have the office be a layer 3 topology?\r\n\r\nYou could.  This is called a Ring topology, and each node has to decide if a given packet is for &quot;my host&quot; or &quot;some other host&quot;.  If it&#39;s mine, I remove it from further communication and process in the application.  If it&#39;s not mine, I send it to the next host.  It&#39;s not very efficient because you&#39;re relying on each host to process and forward, and it could take a while to have the packet reach its destination.\r\n\r\nYou still require all the other layers -- e.g. how to segregate application data from routing information etc in Layer 4.  Layers 5+ are usually application concerns (e.g. session tokens in HTML).\r\n\r\n&gt; Why isn&#39;t the whole internet just one big LAN?\r\n\r\nYou could logically think of it this way.  From a security and ownership point of view, though, it makes sense to segregate.  It&#39;s useful to segregate networks owned by IBM from those owned by Cisco, because IBM doesn&#39;t want their resources exposed to Cisco and vice-versa.  Also responsibilities transfer -- e.g. between ISPs ... a packet is going to go from Comcast to Google to Orange possibly and policies may need to be applied at the edge by each interested party.\r\n\r\n&gt; What prevents us from implementing, say, a firewall as a node in an arbitrary layer 3 topology instead of being at the interface of the network layer and the link layer?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing.  However if there are other routes to the destination, a bad actor could discover that route and avoid the firewall.  So it&#39;s very common to have an air gap in the form of segregated routing.\r\n\r\nIn large network installations, this air gap can be provided by using VLAN technology, basically allowing connectivity to be restricted without providing segregated wiring.\r\n\r\n&gt; Why do we use different protocols (spanning trees vs. routing) to solve the same problem?\r\n\r\nSpanning tree is a way of discovering how networks are connected to most efficiently configure routing.  So, they&#39;re not different protocols that solve the same problem, they&#39;re different network applications that support each other.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418739/what-is-the-difference-between-the-link-layer-and-the-network-layer/58419009#58419009","title":"What is the difference between the link layer and the network layer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":347,"user_id":1318416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b057096c545107b9befa54237dc48d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1318416","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1318416/user1318416"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571248082,"creation_date":1571246890,"question_id":58418739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418739","body_markdown":"I have run into this problem again and again and have never found a sufficient answer to this question.

don&#39;t believe you have any option other than to have/use :-\r\n\r\n- a) have distinct columns names across the tables that are to be included in joins (then there is no need to prefix the column

have a problem which is: Arduino save the MPU-6050 accelerometer datas to an external SRAM. When I ask it it reads back to an array and send it in serial to the PC. It is totally works with 2 accelerometer if I do not move the sensor. If I move the sensor I got a lof of zeros. Here is three picture: [When it works-no moving][1] ; [When it doesn&#39;t work][2] [Only serial plot from raw data][3]\r\n\r\nThe sensor is tested with a simple serial plot. It works perfect. If I measure the mostly constant gravity it works. If I startod to move slowly the sensor I got something like in the second picture.\r\n\r\nIf I don&#39;t use my C# program only use the Arduino own serial monitor. I read&#39;s the numbers into the the array(in the following called: buffer). Serial.println all of the numbers one by one. It works anyway I move or not the sensor. What I dont understand why my c# code and plot works only when the sensor not moving? The sampling rate is the same, The zero, the -2056, the 11562 so on... all numbers are 16bit signed integer. \r\n\r\nIs anyone have any idea?\r\nThanks.:\r\nfatzolaa\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include&lt;SRAM_23LC.h&gt;

In the code below I have used coroutineScope to create a new scope in which these tasks run and launched 5 async tasks each on sending its id and the delay time it should wait. The second coroutine throws an exception. In this case the code does what i want it to do, it calculates the sum of the jobs that successfully finished and the ones that failed return 0.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am reading that there is also supervisorScope in the kotlinx library which should be preferred instead of coroutineScope (which cancels parent/siblings if exception is not handled) for tasks are not dependent on others.

How can I fix this issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418614/extent-reports-version-4-overwriting-test-results","title":"Extent Reports version 4 Overwriting test results?"},{"tags":["c#",".net",".net-4.6"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":975,"user_id":2287427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b12dacf80e8ab397c3fdcd4f0d49c32d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2287427/dave-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571246883,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103179923,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103179923_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":975,"user_id":2287427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b12dacf80e8ab397c3fdcd4f0d49c32d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2287427/dave-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247047,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180000_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571247350,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180129_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247817,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180323,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180323_58418609"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571319814,"post_id":58432477,"comment_id":103208623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address/58432477#comment103208623_58432477"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571328050,"post_id":58432477,"comment_id":103213358,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address/58432477#comment103213358_58432477"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571314627,"creation_date":1571314627,"answer_id":58432477,"question_id":58418609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58432477","body_markdown":"http request can be redirected by local Proxy settings.

Alice issues a transaction to Bob. Bob can deal with this in a number of ways (accept, reject, settle). So far so good. \r\n\r\nHowever, in this scenario Bob can also take the original transaction and generate his own transaction based on this to Carol and Dave. Essentially, if Alice claims $10, Bob can say that Carol should pay $2, Dave $3 and Bob will pay the $5. \r\n\r\nDave could then say that Eve should pay $1 of his share. \r\n\r\nMuch, but not all,  of the data on the original tx is repeated across the subsequent tx. Some information is not to be shared, ie the original value of $10 should not be known to Eve. Carol and Dave do not know what each other is paying. \r\n\r\nThere are some complications. If Alice decides to cancel the claim, the cancellation verification code needs to check that the TX to Carol and Dave are also cancelled, otherwise Bob would end up with money he is not entitled to when they settle. \r\n\r\nAlso, commercially, the sums of the TX that Bob generate can exceed the amount Alice is claiming from him. \r\n\r\nI know this is complex, but does can anyone offer me a clue bat as to where to start? \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418597/linked-transactions-looking-for-clues","title":"Linked Transactions -

It depends on the technology you are using to develop it.\r\nFrom my experience, I would suggest two options:\r\n\r\n**Serverless**\r\n\r\nPay-as-you-go rings the bell of `Serverless` to me. You will pay proportionally to the amount of requests and computer processing. (https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/).\r\nIt is recommended for SPA (if you are developing frontend with **React**, **Vue**, **Angular** or something similar), your backend will be totally detached from it. You can further choose which language to program for each endpoint you will have available (using `lambda functions`).\r\nYou can host your `frontend` in **S3** (static files of the website) and create another **S3** to be used to store uploaded/dynamic files (images and so on).\r\n\r\nIt is totally auto-scalable from the very beginning. (no requests, no pricing, except the fee for file storage in **S3**, which is very fair)\r\n\r\n\r\n**Elastic Beanstalk**\r\n\r\nIf you have a monolith (e.g: cakephp, ruby-on-rails, django, etc.), you can use the **Elastic Beanstalk** service (https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/). You deploy it and set the auto-scaling criteria (e.g: latency, cpu, etc.)\r\n\r\n**And how it applies to your question**: you want to share files between many computers assigned for the application by the auto-scaling. You can configure from the beginning to share a drive between them. This way you can handle common uploaded/dynamic/generated files easily (check this https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/4szgqm/elastic_beanstalk_with_a_shared_drive_efs_as_an/ and https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/services-efs.html)\r\n\r\n**Finally..**\r\n\r\nFor both cases, you will need to deal with your database server size, but AWS is providing some auto-scalling options for databases as well (**RDS** for SQL DBs). For **NoSQL** databases, there are also options for auto-scalling or just set the limits of read/write you want for the development phase and set a different one for production.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t covered all the options, you may be using something not listed above, but it covers most of the cases I have already worked with.\r\n\r\nI hope it can help you!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418594/how-to-automatically-expand-disk-space-as-required-on-amazon-ec2/58418996#58418996","title":"How to automatically expand disk space as required on Amazon EC2"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":100133,"user_id":174777,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/6PnNW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"John Rotenstein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/174777/john-rotenstein"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571269688,"creation_date":1571269688,"answer_id":58423039,"question_id":58418594,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58423039","body_markdown":"Your thinking of &quot;a server&quot; does not match the capabilities offered by the cloud.\r\n\r\nThese days, it is best to **separate compute from database and storage**:\r\n\r\n- Run your **compute** on Amazon EC2, or using containers or even serverless (AWS Lambda).\r\n- Put your **database on Amazon RDS**, such as MySQL or even Amazon Aurora (which is MySQL-compatible and can auto-scale). It also takes care of backups, replication, etc.\r\n- For **file storage** (outside of the database), use Amazon S3. For example, all of the **images** used to show homes can be served directly from S3. There is no limit to the amount of files you can store in S3. It can also handle per-user security using [Amazon S3 pre-signed URLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html).\r\n\r\nThis way, as your product matures, you can modify portions of the system (eg app) without impacting other parts. For example, you could scale across multiple servers, or move to serverless, without impacting the database or file storage systems.\r\n\r\nStorage that is directly-attached to compute should be considered ephemeral (temporary) storage. This way, if a node fails, no data is lost. Use local storage for apps and temporary files, but not for persistent data storage.

You will want to create a base class or interface for all of your inventory items which will contain the properties that all items share (like an ID):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Item\r\n{\r\n    public int Id { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMore specific types of items will then inherit from the `Item` class, like perhaps a weapon.\r\n&gt; I want a way to easily manage and modify items and their values, even if they are customized (e.g. when an Item does 20 base dmg and it was modified by the player to do +10 dmg, when I change the base dmg to 30, the players item should do 40 dmg in total)\r\n\r\nYour weapon class might have a base damage value, a damage modifier value, and a calculated total damage value based on the previous two:\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class Weapon : Item\r\n{\r\n    public int BaseDamage { get; set; }\r\n    public int DamageModifier { get; set; }\r\n    public int TotalDamage =&gt; BaseDamage + DamageModifier;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n&gt; An Item needs to have some kind of slots for things like stickers or attachments, which are also items itself.\r\n\r\nYou could create an interface here (or even move this into your base class - I don&#39;t know enough about the system you&#39;re designing to make that call) which will contain a collection of `Item` objects for this purpose:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface IAttachmentContainer\r\n{\r\n    IEnumerable&lt;Item&gt; Attachments { get; set }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThen implement this interface on any item that can have attachments.\r\nAs for persistence, you will want to look into some type of database system (like Traendy mentioned in the comments).\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI hope this is enough to get you started.

The other alternative however, to define everything in the callback function, would lead to repeated executions of the same thing leading to redundancy.\r\n\r\nI personally found that if I knew how many data items were going to be used, I could simply set an \r\n```if (read_data_length==total_data_length)```\r\ncondition so that all my code is executed once every CSV row is read.\r\n\r\n**My question is whether there is a way to identify the length of a CSV file (in terms of number of Objects, or rows), BEFORE loading a CSV file in order to establish such a limit?**\r\n\r\nSo far my own insight has proven this is difficult to impossible, but I am hoping somebody with more experience in Javascript might be able to clear this up.\r\nThanks in

However, if I just save the JSON to string and send post request directly, I get a 502 gateway error from Shopify. This happens only when creating certain products, where the JSON payload is somewhat bigger than normal. On other products, just saving JSON to a string and then sending to Shopify works OK. Weirdly, when I save the JSON to file from C#, then read that file a few lines below in the same code, and use that content as JSON string and send a post request, it again doesn&#39;t work. What do you think could be the issue?\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the JSON generated using JSON.net which works OK when read from file (https://pastebin.com/9SKFPjGJ)\r\n\r\n    var jsonContent = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObject);\r\n    using (var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $&quot;https://{shopifySlug}.myshopify.com/admin/products/{originalShopifyProductId}.json&quot;))\r\n    {\r\n        requestMessage.AddShopifyHeaders(shopifyAccessToken); // just a method for adding necessary shopify headers\r\n        requestMessage.Content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        response = await client.SendAsync(requestMessage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIts getting hard for me to know the reason.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s what works:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCode that works:  \r\njson.txt was generated using this separately:\r\n\r\n\r\n    System.IO.File.WriteAllText(&quot;E:\\\\json.txt&quot;,JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObject));\r\n\r\n(Note that if the above line of code is inserted before the code below in the same file, then the code below doesn&#39;t work, i.e. the file has to be saved separately for it to work).\r\n\r\nAnd then, just reading the JSON from file and sending that in the POST request works. Code below:\r\n\r\n\r\n    var jsonContent = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(&quot;E:\\\\json.txt&quot;);\r\n    using (var requestMessage = new HttpRequestMessage(HttpMethod.Put, $&quot;https://{shopifySlug}.myshopify.com/admin/products/{originalShopifyProductId}.json&quot;))\r\n    {\r\n        requestMessage.AddShopifyHeaders(shopifyAccessToken); // just a method for adding necessary shopify headers\r\n        requestMessage.Content = new StringContent(jsonContent, Encoding.UTF8, &quot;application/json&quot;);\r\n        response = await client.SendAsync(requestMessage);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso the not working code at the very top works OK for smaller JSON payloads like this one https://pastebin.com/RhYjVuvv","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418803/issue-while-creating-product-using-shopify-api","title":"Issue while creating product using Shopify API"},{"tags":["ssl","gnutls"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259400,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185376,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185376_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259526,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185430,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185430_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571259943,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185583,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185583_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571260112,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103185628,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103185628_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571264092,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103186935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103186935_58420351"},{"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1245,"user_id":1636521,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":39,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2116626f42d8a2f87ee420ecefb1ec0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"flashburn","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1636521/flashburn"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571286815,"post_id":58420351,"comment_id":103191708,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418802/libgnutls-version-and-protocol-standard-correspondence/58420351#comment103191708_58420351"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":68789,"user_id":3081018,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z2NYm.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Steffen Ullrich","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3081018/steffen-ullrich"},"comment_count":6,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571253658,"creation_date":1571253658,"answer_id":58420351,"question_id":58418802,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58420351","body_markdown":"From https://gnutls.org/news.html:\r\n\r\n&gt;

I kept looking online but there doesn&#39;t seem to be a correspondence between library version and protocol standard. So to provide more clarification, here is what I see\r\n\r\n    $ ls -lah /usr/lib/libgnutls.so\r\n    /usr/lib/libgnutls.so -&gt; ibgnutls.so.30.22.0\r\n\r\nFrom this I can see that my library is at version `30.22.0` (we can talk more about library versioning later if you want). What I can&#39;t figure out is what protocol version does this library support. Is it `TLS 1.2` or `TLS 1.3` or both? To find out what `TLS` source code version I have installed I downloaded a dev version of `gnutls` and looked into `/usr/include/gnutls/gnutls.h`. Found the following in there\r\n\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION &quot;3.6.4&quot;\r\n    \r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_MAJOR 3\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_MINOR 6\r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_PATCH 4\r\n    \r\n    #define GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER 0x030604\r\n\r\n\r\nSo it looks like I&#39;m using version 3.6.4 of the source code.

Then, what was initially an old file becomes a new file _during_ sorting, thus the ordering relation &#39;is newer&#39; appears non-transitive, which breaks the contract; hence the error.\r\n\r\nIMHO you can only write your own sorting routine, which would handle such non-transitivity safely. For example it can reiterate when it detects the situation. But take care not to iterate too many times - if two or more files get updated constantly, the re-sorting routine could never finish its work!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418782/sorting-list-of-files-in-android-throwing-comparison-method-violates-its-genera/58526652#58526652","title":"Sorting list of files in android throwing &#39;Comparison method violates its general contract!&#39;"}],"owner":{"reputation":129,"user_id":3251867,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":55,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/43b22056f27b60361971f5c23daa3392?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Adi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3251867/adi"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571845650,"creation_date":1571247086,"question_id":58418782,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418782","body_markdown":"It&#39;s happening on my Android application &amp; here is the stack trace:\r\n\r\n    Caused by java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Comparison method violates its general contract!\r\n           at java.util.TimSort.mergeHi(TimSort.java:864)\r\n           at java.util.TimSort.mergeAt(TimSort.java:481)\r\n           at java.util.TimSort.mergeForceCollapse(TimSort.java:422)\r\n           at java.util.TimSort.sort(TimSort.java:219)\r\n           at java.util.TimSort.sort(TimSort.java:169)\r\n           at java.util.Arrays.sort(Arrays.java:2023)\r\n           at java.util.Collections.sort(Collections.java:1883)\r\n\r\nHere is my sort logic:\r\n\r\n    private static void sortFiles(List&lt;File&gt; listFiles, int sortDirection) {\r\n        try {\r\n          if (sortDirection == sortLatestFirst) {\r\n            Collections.sort(listFiles, new LatestFirstComparator());\r\n            ...\r\n\r\nHere is the comparator:\r\n\r\n    class LatestFirstComparator implements Comparator&lt;File&gt; {\r\n      @Override\r\n      public int compare(File f1, File f2) {\r\n        return Long.compare(f2.lastModified(), f1.lastModified());\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve found related questions &amp; other solutions, but none of them solves my problem.\r\nMoreover, this is not a consistent behavior,  but happening only with some of the app users.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418782/sorting-list-of-files-in-android-throwing-comparison-method-violates-its-genera","title":"Sorting list of files in android throwing &#39;Comparison method violates its general contract!&#39;"},{"tags":["php","homebrew"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":389,"user_id":2340012,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOI3R.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naomi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2340012/naomi"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571247917,"post_id":58418781,"comment_id":103180373,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418781/homebrew-php-and-upgrading-to-php-7#comment103180373_58418781"},{"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":10039548,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q_FKT8pRkrg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/yaIhQHRGLj0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pwntastic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10039548/pwntastic"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":389,"user_id":2340012,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/yOI3R.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Naomi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2340012/naomi"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571262851,"post_id":58418781,"comment_id":103186556,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418781/homebrew-php-and-upgrading-to-php-7#comment103186556_58418781"}],"owner":{"reputation":49,"user_id":10039548,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-q_FKT8pRkrg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAHs/yaIhQHRGLj0/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Pwntastic","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10039548/pwntastic"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":17,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571247081,"creation_date":1571247081,"question_id":58418781,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418781","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to upgrade my php version and it seems to have downloaded the recent 7.1 version but when I run php -v it says its still on 5.6.

If the international code is invalid first \r\n2. If the actual number is invalid when the international phone is valid\r\n\r\nBut when using this on the backend side / with other apps, we don&#39;t really care about this and we don&#39;t really want to see the same errors (just that the `normalized_phone` is valid or not).\r\n\r\nSo far we&#39;ve been taking advantage of ActiveModel to easily serialize errors (`model.errors.map(&amp;:errors_to_json)`). The problem is we have a different representation of the error on the frontend side (because the `phone` is serialized as 2 different attributes) and a backend/DB representation (a single &quot;normalized_phone&quot;)\r\n\r\nWe have an edition service that is responsible for updating various user attributes including the phone and handling various draft states. Basically our main logic call behaves like this\r\n\r\nOur logic is currently like this\r\n\r\n```\r\n# controller\r\ndef update\r\n  transform_client_side_attributes_to_server_side_attributes\r\n  edition_service.new(model, params).call() # will call amongst others model.validate after assigning new attributes\r\n  render_json_using_activemodel_errors_for(model)\r\n  # =&gt; \r\n  # { data: {...},\r\n  #   errors: [...], # each ActiveModel error is serialized there\r\n  # }\r\nend\r\n\r\ndef transform_client_side_attributes_to_server_side_attributes\r\n  international_prefix = params.xxx[:international_prefix]\r\n  number_without_prefix = params.xxx[:number_without_prefix] \r\n  if valid_prefix?(international_prefix)\r\n    if valid_number_for_prefix(number_without_prefix, international_prefix)\r\n      params[:normalized_phone] = normalize(number_without_prefix, international_prefix)\r\n    else\r\n      model.errors.add(:number_without_prefix, :invalid)\r\n    end\r\n  else \r\n    model.errors.add(:international_prefix, xxx)\r\n    return\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, since we have frontend specific errors, we are adding activemodel errors directly on the model as it is very convenient for serializing. The problem is, the edition_service will call at some point `model.validate` and that will have the effect of clearing other validation errors.\r\n\r\n**Is there a way to prevent clearing errors when running validations ?** So that we could stack some validations defined on the model itself and some frontend-specific validations ?\r\n\r\nI understand that ActiveModel might not be designed for this specific scenario, but it feels like it should be able to adapt easily.\r\n\r\nShould I just reimplement a `model.validate_without_clearing_errors` method or maybe switch to another approach ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418757/rails-and-activemodel-errors-how-to-render-frontend-vs-backend-specific-errors","title":"Rails and activemodel errors - how to render frontend vs backend specific errors"},{"tags":["javascript"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":231746,"user_id":1447675,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziYmO.gif?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Nina Scholz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1447675/nina-scholz"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571247172,"post_id":58418756,"comment_id":103180057,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map#comment103180057_58418756"},{"owner":{"reputation":3380,"user_id":3662110,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KDJ9n.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"jmargolisvt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3662110/jmargolisvt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247377,"post_id":58418756,"comment_id":103180145,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map#comment103180145_58418756"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247520,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180213,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180213_58418856"},{"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":11541562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922e908e17f25d44d646a91484398994?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"f278f1b2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541562/f278f1b2"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247582,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180239,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180239_58418856"},{"owner":{"reputation":788,"user_id":6624953,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Jv5IW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"frobinsonj","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6624953/frobinsonj"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":22035,"user_id":860099,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/125k3.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Kamil Kiełczewski","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/860099/kamil-kie%c5%82czewski"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247632,"post_id":58418856,"comment_id":103180257,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418756/array-element-order-change-from-another-array-element-value-using-map/58418856#comment103180257_58418856"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":264,"user_id":11541562,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/922e908e17f25d44d646a91484398994?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"f278f1b2","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11541562/f278f1b2"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571247403,"creation_date":1571247403,"answer_id":58418856,"question_id":58418756,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58418856","body_markdown":"\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const pqr = [\r\n      { name: &quot;R&quot;, age: &quot;20&quot;

For example, if products with `pk_product` 1,2,3 have been deleted and my record `pk_product == 4` has an index of `1` (first in dbf file), how can I get the value `1` in the code, doing something like `record.index == 1`?\r\n\r\nThanks!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418746/how-to-get-record-index-in-python-dbf-lib","title":"How to get record index in Python DBF lib"},{"tags":["python","beautifulsoup"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":56280,"user_id":6241235,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":94,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dCxzx.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"QHarr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6241235/qharr"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571250034,"post_id":58418744,"comment_id":103181276,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python#comment103181276_58418744"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336768,"post_id":58419596,"comment_id":103217140,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#comment103217140_58419596"},{"owner":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571336806,"post_id":58419596,"comment_id":103217159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#comment103217159_58419596"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"last_editor":{"reputation":3868,"user_id":7758804,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zETaV.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Trenton McKinney","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7758804/trenton-mckinney"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571250866,"last_edit_date":1571250866,"creation_date":1571250500,"answer_id":58419596,"question_id":58418744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58419596","body_markdown":"## Your code updated:\r\n\r\n - Use `attrs` to return all the attributes\r\n  - `{&#39;class&#39;: [&#39;lvpic&#39;, &#39;pic&#39;, &#39;img&#39;, &#39;left&#39;], &#39;iid&#39;: &#39;183988596953&#39;}`\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_id(urls):\r\n    for url in urls:\r\n        session = requests.session()\r\n        response = session.get(url)\r\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)\r\n        return soup.find(&quot;div&quot;, {&quot;class&quot;: &quot;lvpic pic img left&quot;}).attrs[&#39;iid&#39;]\r\n\r\niid = find_id(urls)\r\n\r\nprint(iid)\r\n\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &#39;183988596953&#39;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## If you want all `iid`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef find_id(urls):\r\n    for url in urls:\r\n        session = requests.session()\r\n        response = session.get(url)\r\n        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, &quot;html.parser&quot;)\r\n        div = s.find_all(&quot;div&quot;, attrs={&#39;class&#39;: &#39;lvpic pic img left&#39;})\r\n        return [iid.attrs[&#39;iid&#39;] for iid in div]\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418744/extract-a-html-id-from-inside-a-tag-using-beautiful-soup-python/58419596#58419596","title":"extract a html ID from inside a tag using beautiful soup python"}],"owner":{"reputation":62,"user_id":7023467,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LhJpC.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Odhran Hennessy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7023467/odhran-hennessy"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58419596,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571250866,"creation_date":1571246914,"question_id":58418744,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418744","body_markdown":"I am trying to extract only an iid code in html so that i can append it to a url and open the page I need. \r\n\r\nI can find the tag I need by specifying the class of the tag.

layer is the electrical (or light etc) that allows two points (usually the hub/switch/router and the host) to communicate.  On top of that is the protocol such as how mac addresses are distributed, packet formats etc.\r\n\r\nThe OSI model has an opinion on how to define this as well. From:\r\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model#Layer_architecture\r\n\r\n```OSI model\r\nLayer\tProtocol data unit (PDU)\tFunction[6]\r\nHost layers\t\r\n7\tApplication\tData\tHigh-level APIs, including resource sharing, remote file access\r\n6\tPresentation\tTranslation of data between a networking service and an application; including character encoding, data compression and encryption/decryption\r\n5\tSession\tManaging communication sessions, i.e. continuous exchange of information in the form of multiple back-and-forth transmissions between two nodes\r\n4\tTransport\tSegment, Datagram\tReliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement and multiplexing\r\nMedia layers\r\n3\tNetwork\tPacket\tStructuring and managing a multi-node network, including addressing, routing and traffic control\r\n2\tData link\tFrame\tReliable transmission of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer\r\n1\tPhysical\tSymbol\tTransmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Link layer is layer 2, and specifies only that bytes flow between the two nodes, but not the format of the bytes -- that&#39;s layer 3.\r\n\r\nSome of your subsequent questions:\r\n\r\n&gt;Suppose you have an office with computers connected on a LAN. Why can&#39;t all the computers act as their own routers and have the office be a layer 3 topology?\r\n\r\nYou could.  This is called a Ring topology, and each node has to decide if a given packet is for &quot;my host&quot; or &quot;some other host&quot;.  If it&#39;s mine, I remove it from further communication and process in the application.  If it&#39;s not mine, I send it to the next host.  It&#39;s not very efficient because you&#39;re relying on each host to process and forward, and it could take a while to have the packet reach its destination.\r\n\r\nYou still require all the other layers -- e.g. how to segregate application data from routing information etc in Layer 4.  Layers 5+ are usually application concerns (e.g. session tokens in HTML).\r\n\r\n&gt; Why isn&#39;t the whole internet just one big LAN?\r\n\r\nYou could logically think of it this way.  From a security and ownership point of view, though, it makes sense to segregate.  It&#39;s useful to segregate networks owned by IBM from those owned by Cisco, because IBM doesn&#39;t want their resources exposed to Cisco and vice-versa.  Also responsibilities transfer -- e.g. between ISPs ... a packet is going to go from Comcast to Google to Orange possibly and policies may need to be applied at the edge by each interested party.\r\n\r\n&gt; What prevents us from implementing, say, a firewall as a node in an arbitrary layer 3 topology instead of being at the interface of the network layer and the link layer?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely nothing.  However if there are other routes to the destination, a bad actor could discover that route and avoid the firewall.  So it&#39;s very common to have an air gap in the form of segregated routing.\r\n\r\nIn large network installations, this air gap can be provided by using VLAN technology, basically allowing connectivity to be restricted without providing segregated wiring.\r\n\r\n&gt; Why do we use different protocols (spanning trees vs. routing) to solve the same problem?\r\n\r\nSpanning tree is a way of discovering how networks are connected to most efficiently configure routing.  So, they&#39;re not different protocols that solve the same problem, they&#39;re different network applications that support each other.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418739/what-is-the-difference-between-the-link-layer-and-the-network-layer/58419009#58419009","title":"What is the difference between the link layer and the network layer?"}],"owner":{"reputation":347,"user_id":1318416,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b057096c545107b9befa54237dc48d9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1318416","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1318416/user1318416"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1571248082,"creation_date":1571246890,"question_id":58418739,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58418739","body_markdown":"I have run into this problem again and again and have never found a sufficient answer to this question.

don&#39;t believe you have any option other than to have/use :-\r\n\r\n- a) have distinct columns names across the tables that are to be included in joins (then there is no need to prefix the column

have a problem which is: Arduino save the MPU-6050 accelerometer datas to an external SRAM. When I ask it it reads back to an array and send it in serial to the PC. It is totally works with 2 accelerometer if I do not move the sensor. If I move the sensor I got a lof of zeros. Here is three picture: [When it works-no moving][1] ; [When it doesn&#39;t work][2] [Only serial plot from raw data][3]\r\n\r\nThe sensor is tested with a simple serial plot. It works perfect. If I measure the mostly constant gravity it works. If I startod to move slowly the sensor I got something like in the second picture.\r\n\r\nIf I don&#39;t use my C# program only use the Arduino own serial monitor. I read&#39;s the numbers into the the array(in the following called: buffer). Serial.println all of the numbers one by one. It works anyway I move or not the sensor. What I dont understand why my c# code and plot works only when the sensor not moving? The sampling rate is the same, The zero, the -2056, the 11562 so on... all numbers are 16bit signed integer. \r\n\r\nIs anyone have any idea?\r\nThanks.:\r\nfatzolaa\r\n\r\n\r\n    #include&lt;SRAM_23LC.h&gt;

In the code below I have used coroutineScope to create a new scope in which these tasks run and launched 5 async tasks each on sending its id and the delay time it should wait. The second coroutine throws an exception. In this case the code does what i want it to do, it calculates the sum of the jobs that successfully finished and the ones that failed return 0.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am reading that there is also supervisorScope in the kotlinx library which should be preferred instead of coroutineScope (which cancels parent/siblings if exception is not handled) for tasks are not dependent on others.

How can I fix this issue?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418614/extent-reports-version-4-overwriting-test-results","title":"Extent Reports version 4 Overwriting test results?"},{"tags":["c#",".net",".net-4.6"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":975,"user_id":2287427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b12dacf80e8ab397c3fdcd4f0d49c32d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2287427/dave-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571246883,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103179923,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103179923_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":975,"user_id":2287427,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b12dacf80e8ab397c3fdcd4f0d49c32d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Dave S","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2287427/dave-s"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247047,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180000,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180000_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571247350,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180129,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180129_58418609"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571247817,"post_id":58418609,"comment_id":103180323,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address#comment103180323_58418609"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571319814,"post_id":58432477,"comment_id":103208623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address/58432477#comment103208623_58432477"},{"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":23648,"user_id":47589,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/16703987f5d8e44af08a28f4942ec0f1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Amy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/47589/amy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571328050,"post_id":58432477,"comment_id":103213358,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418609/what-in-a-local-pc-setting-can-change-a-httpwebrequest-servicepoint-address/58432477#comment103213358_58432477"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":923,"user_id":201889,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":82,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d3cf6a3511a10e6dde5146bc95b588c7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"GenZiy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/201889/genziy"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571314627,"creation_date":1571314627,"answer_id":58432477,"question_id":58418609,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58432477","body_markdown":"http request can be redirected by local Proxy settings.

Alice issues a transaction to Bob. Bob can deal with this in a number of ways (accept, reject, settle). So far so good. \r\n\r\nHowever, in this scenario Bob can also take the original transaction and generate his own transaction based on this to Carol and Dave. Essentially, if Alice claims $10, Bob can say that Carol should pay $2, Dave $3 and Bob will pay the $5. \r\n\r\nDave could then say that Eve should pay $1 of his share. \r\n\r\nMuch, but not all,  of the data on the original tx is repeated across the subsequent tx. Some information is not to be shared, ie the original value of $10 should not be known to Eve. Carol and Dave do not know what each other is paying. \r\n\r\nThere are some complications. If Alice decides to cancel the claim, the cancellation verification code needs to check that the TX to Carol and Dave are also cancelled, otherwise Bob would end up with money he is not entitled to when they settle. \r\n\r\nAlso, commercially, the sums of the TX that Bob generate can exceed the amount Alice is claiming from him. \r\n\r\nI know this is complex, but does can anyone offer me a clue bat as to where to start? \r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58418597/linked-transactions-looking-for-clues","title":"Linked Transactions - looking for clues"}],"has_more":true,"quota_max":10000,"quota_remaining":8926}
