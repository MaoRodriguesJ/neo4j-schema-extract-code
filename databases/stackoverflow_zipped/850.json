So both two parameters must control my play: retries count (play fails if retry count exceeded) and timeout (play fails if timeout exceeded).\r\n\r\nI can implement each strategy separately:\r\n```\r\n- name: My shell task with retries\r\n  shell: set -o pipefail &amp;&amp; ./myscript.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a &quot;{{mylogfile}}&quot;\r\n  args:\r\n    chdir: &quot;{{myscript_dir}}/&quot;\r\n    executable: /bin/bash\r\n  register: my_job\r\n  until: my_job is succeeded\r\n  retries: &quot;{{test_retries}}&quot;\r\n  delay: 0\r\n```\r\nor with async:\r\n```\r\n- name: My async shell task\r\n  shell: set -o pipefail &amp;&amp; ./myscript.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | tee -a &quot;{{mylogfile}}&quot;\r\n  args:\r\n    chdir: &quot;{{myscript_dir}}/&quot;\r\n    executable: /bin/bash\r\n  register: my_job\r\n  async: &quot;{{test_timeout}}&quot;\r\n  poll: 0\r\n\r\n- name: Tracking for async shell task\r\n  wait_for:\r\n    path: &quot;{{mylogfile}}&quot;\r\n    search_regex: &#39;^.*Done in \\S+&#39;\r\n    timeout: &quot;{{test_timeout}}&quot;\r\n  ignore_errors: yes\r\n  register: result\r\n```\r\nThe second task parses previous task log until the job is finished - i.e. searches &quot;Done in x seconds&quot; string. Maybe it&#39;s not the best practice and I should use `async_status` but can&#39;t find how to set timeout with it (it&#39;s only have retries for checking job status which is pretty silly for me).\r\n\r\nSooo... Can I combine both strategies to control my task both with retries count and timeout?\r\n\r\nUPD: I tried to run both `until` and `async` for `shell` module and surprisingly my play doesn&#39;t fail but retries doesn&#39;t work.

the idea is, that your `Command` describes which services it will use in it&#39;s constructor, so if you only want a `UserManager` it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n\r\nclass MyCommand extends Command\r\n{\r\n    private $userManager;\r\n\r\n    public function __construct(UserManager $userManager)\r\n    {\r\n        // Make sure to call the parent constructor\r\n        parent::__construct(null);\r\n\r\n        $this-&gt;userManager = $userManager;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSymfony Console does not say anything about the creation of the service, because that is not its responsibility, this is what the [Service Container](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container.html) (which is part of the Dependency Injection component) is for in a typical Symfony application and you can use it as well, but possibly in your small CLI Tool it can be overkill.\r\n\r\n# The easy way\r\n\r\nIn you `bin/console.php` (or its equivalent) you can instantiate all services when adding the command like this:\r\n\r\n```php\r\nuse Symfony\\Component\\Console\\Application;\r\n\r\n$application = new Application();\r\n\r\n$userManager = new UserManager(...);\r\n$application-&gt;add(new MyCommand($userManager));\r\n\r\n$application-&gt;run();\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Less easy approach\r\n\r\nAs you can imagine this can become quite tedious and annoying especially if you need different configurations. You can use the service container standalone and make it read the service configuration (basically a representation of the whole stuff between `$app = new Application()` and `$app-&gt;run()`:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$containerBuilder = new ContainerBuilder();\r\n\r\n$loader = new YamlFileLoader($containerBuilder, new FileLocator(__DIR__));\r\n$loader-&gt;load(&#39;config.yaml&#39;);\r\n\r\n// ...\r\n$containerBuilder-&gt;compile();\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee docs for [Compiling container](https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/dependency_injection/compilation.html).\r\n\r\n# Alternative approach\r\nIf you like to keep the code for creating all those services and don&#39;t want a container you can create Factory-classes instead, that create your UserManager (when its needed, instead of creating all services upfront):\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$application = new Application();\r\n\r\n$userManagerFactory = new UserManagerFactory() ;\r\n$application-&gt;add($userManagerFactory-&gt;createUserManager());\r\n\r\n$application-&gt;run();\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could also use other containers instead of Symfony&#39;s Container if you think configuring and compiling it is too much work. There is for example a very lightweight array based solution called Pimple which might be better suited for your use case or you can use one of the many other libs out there.\r\n\r\n# tl;dr\r\n\r\nCreating services is not the responsibility of the Console component, hence it&#39;s not explained. There are many different approaches with different pros/cons, e.g. instantiating services only when needed vs. configuration required to get a container (or container-like thing to hold your services).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340324/symfony-console-confused-about-services/58340794#58340794","title":"Symfony Console : Confused about services"}],"owner":{"reputation":632,"user_id":4474629,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":95,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e3d1d6e41980939611b75370816b8843?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Little Code","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4474629/little-code"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":49,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":1,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58340794,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570795022,"creation_date":1570793289,"question_id":58340324,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340324","body_markdown":"I am using Symfony Console as standalone to create a CLI app.\r\n\r\nThe Symfony Console documentation is clear as mud when it comes to services.

I have marked the task for 5x labeling per image.\r\n\r\nSome of the labels are quite tricky, especially for vessels that are far away or only partially visible, but I have indicated with plenty of examples what needs to happen.

Can you move to a new row/record and add it? No use trying all kinds of forms and code if the linked table don&#39;t allow adding of records. And while we are at this, did you try editing a record when you open the linked table? (again, no use trying all kinds of forms code, VBA and all that fancy stuff - always just try opening the table first, and see if you can edit). Then and ONLY then do you want to start messing with forms.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, the reason(s) why you can&#39;t edit (or add) data  in a linked table are:\r\n\r\nThe linked table does not have a primary key set. When you link a table, after linking, the above 2 second test is a good idea. You can also open the linked table in design view, and take a quick check to see if the linked table &quot;sees&quot; the PK.\r\n\r\nSo, you want the table on the server side to have a PK. And of course it likely will be some kind of autonumber column in addition to having been set with a PK.\r\n\r\nIf the linked table does not have a PK (or access can&#39;t figure out and see the PK), then the table will be read only - you not be able to edit, and of course not be able to add new rows.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340300/msaccess-oracle-cant-add-record-to-form-recordset/58346982#58346982","title":"MSAccess - Oracle: Cant add record to form recordset"}],"owner":{"reputation":45,"user_id":480786,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98c9a7597ce847b0e044fcba8d108b3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/480786/rafa"},"last_editor":{"reputation":45,"user_id":480786,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":0,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/98c9a7597ce847b0e044fcba8d108b3d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Rafa","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/480786/rafa"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":22,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58346982,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570819975,"creation_date":1570793183,"last_edit_date":1570793848,"question_id":58340300,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340300","body_markdown":"I have a MSAccess application and I want to migrate data to an Oracle DB.

am not sure that we can think about optimization on this small code sample\r\n\r\n - Often company design rules will compel you to have an asynchronous reset assertion and synchronous de-assertion\r\n - 50% of the time you will not have a &#39;cond&#39; signal synchronous of the clock so that you will have to double sample it anyway\r\n\r\nSo we can take advantage of these constraints to elaborate a somewhat proper ( imho ) reset state by de-asserting the internal reset after 3 clock periods, taking into account that the double sampling of COND will take 2 clock periods. \r\n\r\nBy this way we may benefit from (almost) one clock period stable reset state.\r\n\r\nBut for sure you may do this on FPGA where you can export a data signal ( here the internal reset compared to the external

was wondering how a logic synthesizer interprets a conditional reset value.\r\nFor example, the initial state of a FSM depends on an asynchronous reset signal and some other signal as shown below.\r\n\r\n```vhd\r\nstate_reg : process(clk, reset)\r\nbegin\r\n    if reset = &#39;0&#39; then\r\n        if cond = &#39;1&#39; then\r\n            state &lt;= init_state_0;\r\n        else\r\n

optimizations are performed by synthesizers when the reset value is some constant, however is this also the case in a example like the one above?\r\n\r\nOne reason for such a design could be the optimization of the state machine since no intermediate state is required to choose between the two initial states.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340268/vhdl-synthesis-conditional-reset-value","title":"VHDL Synthesis: Conditional Reset

(event.which &lt; 48 || event.which &gt; 57)) {\r\n              event.preventDefault();\r\n            }\r\n\r\nStill no comma allowed..\r\n          });\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340259/how-can-i-create-an-input-field-that-allows-only-numbers-and-comma-and-dot","title":"How can I create an input field that allows only numbers and comma and dot?"},{"tags":["db2"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5579,"user_id":8290634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d23c338d78a579b717f1cb6e9f16fb1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8290634/mao"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570793347,"post_id":58340258,"comment_id":103035862,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340258/when-i-am-loading-data-from-file-to-db2-database-for-timestamp-datatype-having-o#comment103035862_58340258"},{"owner":{"reputation":3754,"user_id":10418264,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4yry5z1jK1k/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/AAN31DXU7dE-_5R0V6p1mZKJGvuk_vSCKQ/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Mark Barinstein","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10418264/mark-barinstein"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570806622,"post_id":58340258,"comment_id":103043255,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340258/when-i-am-loading-data-from-file-to-db2-database-for-timestamp-datatype-having-o#comment103043255_58340258"},{"owner":{"reputation":15269,"user_id":1227152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hr5l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mustaccio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1227152/mustaccio"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5579,"user_id":8290634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d23c338d78a579b717f1cb6e9f16fb1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8290634/mao"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570815405,"post_id":58340258,"comment_id":103047152,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340258/when-i-am-loading-data-from-file-to-db2-database-for-timestamp-datatype-having-o#comment103047152_58340258"},{"owner":{"reputation":5579,"user_id":8290634,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d23c338d78a579b717f1cb6e9f16fb1b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"mao","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8290634/mao"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":15269,"user_id":1227152,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4hr5l.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"mustaccio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1227152/mustaccio"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570815522,"post_id":58340258,"comment_id":103047200,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340258/when-i-am-loading-data-from-file-to-db2-database-for-timestamp-datatype-having-o#comment103047200_58340258"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":366,"user_id":11946299,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/HZiNd.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"kkuduk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11946299/kkuduk"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571046172,"creation_date":1571046172,"answer_id":58374083,"question_id":58340258,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58374083","body_markdown":"`TIMESTAMP` format includes the date and time, so internally it must be stored stored as a binary structure that contains more data than just the date, see:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndb2 &quot;describe values current date&quot;

I&#39;m by no means a security expert.\r\n\r\nA JWT&#39;s job is not to sign the *content of a request body*, it&#39;s to provide verifiable information to a receiving service about the origin of the JWT and the claims it contains.  So, when your service receives a JWT, you can verify some or all of the important aspects of it:\r\n\r\n - Public key if asymmetrically signed\r\n - Issuer\r\n - Audience\r\n - Expiration\r\n\r\nAnd so forth.\r\n\r\nAs to how to make sure the **content** of a request is what it purports to be, that is the job of **TLS** - [transport layer security][1].  The [TLS handshake process][2] is where the sending and receiving servers essentially get to know each other, validate that each are trustworthy, and generate their own asymmetric keyset (per session!) to encrypt traffic between them.\r\n\r\nSo, the point of TLS is to ensure that data sent by one trusted source arrives intact (and encrypted) at another trusted source where it can be decrypted.  While not exactly the mechanism you asked about, I believe it meets the goal.\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/\r\n  [2]: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340244/json-web-token-jwt-can-be-used-to-guarantee-the-integrity-of-the-http-body/58348374#58348374","title":"Json Web Token (JWT) - can be used to guarantee the integrity of the HTTP body?"}],"owner":{"reputation":753,"user_id":6374900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe970c24ce18d15cb69ab7068f892b64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Antonio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6374900/antonio"},"last_editor":{"reputation":753,"user_id":6374900,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fe970c24ce18d15cb69ab7068f892b64?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Antonio","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6374900/antonio"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1571141564,"creation_date":1570792999,"last_edit_date":1571141564,"question_id":58340244,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340244","body_markdown":"There is much info on the internet about JsonWebTokens, but not a lot about using it to sign the content of the HTTP message.\r\n\r\nSo it can sign its own claims, but it is not clear to me if there is a standard way (and available implementations) to let it carry a signature of the body of the message (at the very least, whatever is below the HTTP headers).\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s paramount, because if another client stole the token itself, it could be used to craft non legitimate requests until it expires.\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s the only resource that I found so far about the topic: [API Message Integrity With JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://dzone.com/articles/api-message-integrity-with-json-web-token-jwt). The title is promising but the article doesn&#39;t really tell how to go about that, it is just showing the interest in doing so.\r\n\r\nBy the way, as a plus, if it is possible to sign the content of the body, a fail-fast implementation of the signature&#39;s validation would be great, for instance a piece-wise one (say, to discard the message if it immediately recognizes the first 10kB have been tampered, instead of having to ingest the whole 10MB message).\r\n\r\n\r\n**More details**\r\n\r\nI am aware that JWT is a _token_, so the common usage is having an authorization party deliver the token to the client, which will then forward it transparently in its requests to the server. So the auth party has no idea what actual requests the client will do next, and won&#39;t be able to sign the content of such requests (which would also be impractical, a different &quot;token&quot; should be issued for each request).\r\nIt merely gives the token to the client which would be attached by the client, unaltered, to each request.\r\n\r\nBut I suppose that in some cases in the real world, the JWT is also produced by the client itself (not by a third party) which means that the client knows the shared secret, and legitimately signs the requests for itself.  \r\nIn that case the client may, in principle, sign the content of the http body, not only the contents of the JWT token.  \r\nAll in all, I suspect that the JWT format doesn&#39;t cater for such signature. The client and server should define their own protocol/format to do that.\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340244/json-web-token-jwt-can-be-used-to-guarantee-the-integrity-of-the-http-body","title":"Json Web Token (JWT) - can be used to guarantee the integrity of the HTTP body?"},{"tags":["c#",".net","abcpdf"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":156,"user_id":1501181,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/677e56da58bee1f198f9347621dbc70b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"arvind.d","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1501181/arvind-d"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1570792997,"creation_date":1570792997,"answer_id":58340242,"question_id":58340241,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340242","body_markdown":"To accomplish this, you need to add the image as an object into the document via [AddImageObject](https://www.websupergoo.com/helppdfnet/source/5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addimageobject.htm) and extract it as a PixMap from the document&#39;s ObjectSoup container and apply a [Recolor](https://www.websupergoo.com/helppdfnet/source/6-abcpdf.objects/pixmap/1-methods/recolor.htm) on the PixMap with the destination colour space. \r\n\r\nHere is the final code that I managed to use successfully:\r\n\r\n```c#\r\nDoc theDoc = new Doc();\r\ntheDoc.ColorSpace = theDoc.AddColorSpaceSpot(&quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;0 0 100 0&quot;);\r\nColorSpace goldSpotColor = (ColorSpace)theDoc.ObjectSoup[theDoc.ColorSpace];\r\n\r\nXImage image = XImage.FromFile(&quot;images/gradient_alpha.png&quot;, new XReadOptions());\r\n\r\nint theID = theDoc.AddImageObject(image, true);\r\nint imageID = theDoc.GetInfoInt(theID, &quot;XObject&quot;);\r\nPixMap thePM = (PixMap)theDoc.ObjectSoup[imageID];\r\n\r\nthePM.Recolor(goldSpotColor);\r\n\r\ntheDoc.Save($&quot;output/spot_test_{DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;yyyyMMdd_HHmmss&quot;)}.pdf&quot;);\r\ntheDoc.Clear();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it seems way too much steps to take for achieving what we want but ABCpdf is a low-level PDF manipulation library that is very powerful.

Usually these type of channels are used in the printing industry to add specialty colours such as gold, silver, etc onto the printed material and instructs the printing machine to use special inks during the process. Each spot colour channel can contain only 1 colour (with varying intensities based on their alpha value).\r\n\r\nThe problem comes with figuring out how to do that easily using ABCpdf. While the documentation does have a sample code for this using the [AddColorSpaceSpot](https://www.websupergoo.com/helppdfnet/source/5-abcpdf/doc/1-methods/addcolorspacespot.htm) function in combination with the AddText function, there is no indication on how to accomplish this using an image. Any attempt at replacing AddText with AddImage is futile as it only adds the image as a normal RGB or CMYK object.\r\n\r\nThe sample code from the documentation reads:\r\n```c#\r\nDoc theDoc = new Doc();\r\ntheDoc.Rect.Inset(20, 20);\r\ntheDoc.FontSize = 300;\r\ntheDoc.ColorSpace = theDoc.AddColorSpaceSpot(&quot;GOLD&quot;, &quot;0 0 100 0&quot;);\r\nfor (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++) {\r\n  theDoc.Color.Gray = 255 / i;\r\n  theDoc.AddText(theDoc.Color.Gray.ToString());\r\n  theDoc.Rect.Move(25, -50);\r\n}\r\ntheDoc.Save(Server.MapPath(&quot;docaddcolorspacespot.pdf&quot;));\r\ntheDoc.Clear();\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the above code I tried the following in a console app:\r\n```c#\r\nDoc theDoc = new Doc();\r\ntheDoc.Rect.Inset(10, 10);\r\ntheDoc.ColorSpace = theDoc.AddColorSpaceSpot(&quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;0 0 100 0&quot;);\r\ntheDoc.FontSize = 300;\r\ntheDoc.Color.Gray = 255;\r\ntheDoc.AddText(&quot;My Text&quot;);\r\ntheDoc.Save($&quot;output/spot_test_{DateTime.Now.ToString(&quot;yyyyMMdd_HHmmss&quot;)}.pdf&quot;);\r\ntheDoc.Clear();\r\n```\r\nAll works well up to now, the text &quot;My Text&quot; is present in the output PDF file in the correct &quot;Gold&quot; channel that was added.\r\n\r\nSo I replace the line `theDoc.AddText(&quot;My Text&quot;);` with `theDoc.AddImage(&quot;images/gradient_alpha.png&quot;)&#39;` expecting it to add this image into the current colour space that I created, but it didn&#39;t work.\r\n\r\nManually creating a new colour space, image object and pixmap object did not work either:\r\n```c#\r\nDoc theDoc = new Doc();\r\n\r\nvar cs = new ColorSpace(theDoc.ObjectSoup, ColorSpaceType.Separation);\r\ncs.Doc.Color.String = &quot;0 0 100 0&quot;;\r\ncs.Doc.Color.Name = &quot;Gold&quot;;\r\ntheDoc.ColorSpace = cs.ID;\r\n\r\nvar image = new XImage();\r\nimage.SetFile(&quot;images/gradient_alpha.png&quot;);\r\nPixMap px = PixMap.FromXImage(theDoc.ObjectSoup, image);\r\npx.Recolor(cs);\r\n\r\ntheDoc.AddImage(px.GetBitmap());\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, how do we correctly add an image into a spot colour channel?\r\nRead the answer below to find out!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340241/how-to-add-an-image-into-a-spot-colour-channel-for-a-pdf-document-using-abcpdf","title":"How to add an image into a spot colour channel for a PDF document using ABCpdf?"},{"tags":["java","hibernate","hql"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2188,"user_id":6682274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1035300153254401/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sudhir Ojha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6682274/sudhir-ojha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570794494,"post_id":58340240,"comment_id":103036471,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340240/hql-createquery-throws-nullpointerexception-when-create-new-object-in-query#comment103036471_58340240"},{"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":3122175,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MeSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Du Tran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3122175/du-tran"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2188,"user_id":6682274,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":25,"profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1035300153254401/picture?type=large","display_name":"Sudhir Ojha","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6682274/sudhir-ojha"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570874542,"post_id":58340240,"comment_id":103059810,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340240/hql-createquery-throws-nullpointerexception-when-create-new-object-in-query#comment103059810_58340240"}],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":115,"user_id":3122175,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":92,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/2MeSi.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Du Tran","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3122175/du-tran"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570874991,"post_id":58340513,"comment_id":103059918,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340240/hql-createquery-throws-nullpointerexception-when-create-new-object-in-query/58340513#comment103059918_58340513"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3183,"user_id":5752737,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/4399530f88749f2a24bcbaef6f625490?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"William Burnham","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5752737/william-burnham"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570793957,"creation_date":1570793957,"answer_id":58340513,"question_id":58340240,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340513","body_markdown":"From the stack trace it looks like there&#39;s no constructor that would satisfy your `CasesOverviewDTO(:filterColumnString, Math.toIntExact(count(c.id))`, or if there is, it&#39;s not in the same package as the class the hql query is being created in, and therefore needs to be fully qualified (add the package name like `new com.some.package.CasesOverviewDTO(args)`).

Once you learn Docker, you learn how to package environments into containers and deploy them. Once you&#39;ve learnt how to build docker images, you need to &#39;orchestrate&#39; them. What does that mean?\r\n\r\nThat means, if you have a bunch of microservices (in the form of containers), you can spin up multiple machines and tell Kubernetes which image/container goes where and so you can orchestrate your app using Docker images (packaged environments) and then Kubernetes as the underlying resource provider to run these containers, and control when they are spun up/killed. \r\n\r\nAssuming you don&#39;t have a massive cluster on-prem (or at home) Kubernetes on a single personal computer is rather useless. You would need to learn a cloud platform (or invest in a server) to utilise Kubernetes efficiently.\r\n\r\nOnce you learn this, you would possibly need to find a way for your containers to communicate with one another. In my opinion, the two most important things any amateur programmer needs to know are:\r\n\r\n1. Message brokers\r\n2. REST\r\n\r\n**Message brokers:** Kafka, RabbitMQ (personal fave), Google Pub/Sub, etc.\r\n\r\n**REST:** Basically sending/receiving data via HTTP requests. \r\n\r\nOnce all of this is done, you&#39;ve learnt how to build images, orchestrate them, have them communicate with one another and use resources from other machines (utilizing the cloud or on-prem servers)\r\n\r\nThere are many other uses for Kubernetes, but in my opinion, this should be enough to entice you to learn this key-skill.\r\n\r\nKubernetes and Docker is the future, because it removes the need to worry about environments. If you have a docker image, you can run that image on Mac, Linux, Windows or basically any machine with a hypervisor. Increase portability, and decreases over-head of setting up environments each time. Also allows you to spin up 1 or 100 or 1000 or 10,000 containers (excellent for scalability!)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340210/what-is-the-scope-of-learning-kubernetes/58340733#58340733","title":"What is the scope of learning kubernetes?"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":157,"user_id":10454736,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-t76JWPSBF50/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAANg/FPrRESPsQbg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Tushar Mahajan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10454736/tushar-mahajan"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570795113,"creation_date":1570795113,"answer_id":58340819,"question_id":58340210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58340819","body_markdown":"Yes, if you are looking to explore fully then security aspect can also be a thing you can learn and these days its in demand where various clients want to get security leaks checked at level of containers, containers registry and even at level of kubernetes also.\r\n\r\nYou can become DevSecOps with couple of certifications.\r\n\r\nAnd pertaining to your later question I can&#39;t envisage anything because here you can just deploy containers and you can even deploy some python code there which is expected to collect some data from sensors and do some computations.\r\n\r\nPlease comment if something specific is your question","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340210/what-is-the-scope-of-learning-kubernetes/58340819#58340819","title":"What is the scope of learning kubernetes?"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11527914,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rBNuIGcCi9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdH_rKWTvh6Y3li5ZdKUrZo-OPmfw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"asho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11527914/asho"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":11527914,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rBNuIGcCi9E/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdH_rKWTvh6Y3li5ZdKUrZo-OPmfw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"asho","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11527914/asho"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":2,"closed_date":1570816415,"accepted_answer_id":58340733,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1570795113,"creation_date":1570792895,"last_edit_date":1570794640,"question_id":58340210,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340210","body_markdown":"I came across the word &quot;Kubernetes&quot; recently while searching for some online courses.

The forecasts for `f` are denoted `f_k`.\r\n\r\nI want to use a Kalman filter to infer forecasts for `t` as I assume there is some degree of correlation between `k` and `f`. For this, I am using `pykalman`.\r\n\r\nIt works perfectly fine in a 1D setting as seen below:\r\n\r\n    n_timesteps = t.shape[0]\r\n\r\n    observations = t.values * ((f_k - f)/f + 1).reshape(-1,1)\r\n    model = stl.decompose(t, period=52, lo_delta=0.01, lo_frac=0.2)\r\n    observations = model.trend.reshape(-1,1) * ((f_k - f)/f + 1).reshape(-1,1) # Get trend\r\n    kf = KalmanFilter(n_dim_obs=1, n_dim_state=1)\r\n\r\n    states_pred = kf.em(observations).filter(observations)[0]\r\n   \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\nHere we clearly see how the yellow trend filters out noise in the signal.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would expect to see the exact same result for the following where the observations are 2-dimensional and the state space remains the same, and the observation matrix only uses the first dimension.\r\n\r\n    m = stl.decompose(t.values * ((f_k - f)/f + 1), period=52, lo_delta=0.01, lo_frac=0.2)\r\n    obs1 = m.trend.reshape(-1,1) * ((f_k - f)/f + 1).reshape(-1,1)\r\n    obs2 = m.trend.reshape(-1,1) * ((f_k - f)/f + 1).reshape(-1,1)\r\n    observations = np.array([obs1,obs2]).reshape(-1,2)\r\n    \r\n    em_vars = [&#39;transition_offsets&#39;, &#39;transition_matrices&#39;, &#39;observation_covariance&#39;,\r\n               &#39;observation_offsets&#39;, &#39;transition_covariance&#39;,\r\n               &#39;initial_state_mean&#39;, &#39;initial_state_covariance&#39;] \r\n\r\n    kf = KalmanFilter(n_dim_obs=2, n_dim_state=1, observation_matrices=np.array([[1],[0]]))\r\n    states_pred = kf.em(observations, em_vars=em_vars).filter(observations)[0]\r\n\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead, the Kalman filter used the first set of observations for the first half of the time period and the second dimension for the second half of the time period. If I included three dimensions, it would show 3 of those peaks. I cannot figure out why that is since ` observation_matrices=np.array([[1],[0]])` is specified (and when looking at the source code [pykalman github][3]).\r\n\r\nReading similar questions here, it seems `observation_matrix` is the matrix `H` that maps the state space into the observation space: `z = Hx`. However, in Pykalman there is not an option to map the observation space into the state space as I see it (that would be done directly in `observations`). \r\n\r\nHence, in this context does it even make sense to include more dimensions in the observation space than in the state space? Does it ever make sense? Why does `Pykalman` treat the observations for each dimension in sequential time? \r\n\r\nBonus question: are there other (smarter) ways of inferring forecasts for `t` using forecasts from `f` using

And your `refreshImages` method doesn&#39;t return a TimerTask, so that doesn&#39;t compile.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use one of these two Timer methods, you need to create an instance of TimerTask, and pass that as argument.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that you would like to pass a function that **will be** executed after some delay. That&#39;s not what you&#39;re doing right now. What you&#39;re doing is that you execute `refreshImages()` immediately, and pass its returned value to `schedule()`.\r\n\r\nPassing a function is not possible with the native Timer schedule method: it doesn&#39;t expect a function, but a TimerTask. But as the Kotlin documentation you linked to shows, it&#39;s possible by calling one of the extension functions of the Kotlin standard library.\r\n\r\nThe signature of the schedule extension function is\r\n\r\n```\r\ninline fun Timer.schedule(\r\n    delay: Long,\r\n    crossinline action: TimerTask.() -&gt; Unit\r\n): TimerTask\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, as you can see, its first argument is a delay, and its second argument is a function with `TimerTask`as receiver. So you can call this extension function using a delay as first argument, and a lambda as second argment:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntimer.schedule(TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(5)) {\r\n    refreshImages(knownPosts, knownFiles, httpClient)\r\n}\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58340167/how-to-schedule-repeating-task-in-kotlin/58340738#58340738","title":"How to schedule repeating task in kotlin?"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":12200650,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/de9a5dfe4a171e7b7135464a52740fb2?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"0vOiCQne","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12200650/0voicqne"},"last_editor":{"reputation":905,"user_id":11567551,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/612ccd6960e869b7f26ff8703e9b09b4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Michiel Leegwater","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11567551/michiel-leegwater"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58340738,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570803586,"creation_date":1570792758,"last_edit_date":1570803586,"question_id":58340167,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58340167","body_markdown":"I want to call some api in the background every X minutes and then process the json file I get\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve lokked into this documentation: https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.concurrent/java.util.-timer/schedule.html\r\n\r\nI&#39;m new to kotlin (I used java before) and I have no idea how to use those functions, any examples of usage would be helpful.\r\n\r\nRight now I have something like this:\r\n```\r\nTimer(&quot;NameOfMyTimer&quot;, true).schedule(refreshImages(knownPosts, knownFiles, httpClient), TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(5))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the result is:\r\n```\r\nNone of the following functions can be called with the arguments supplied: \r\npublic open fun schedule(p0: TimerTask!, p1: Date!): Unit defined in java.util.Timer\r\npublic open fun schedule(p0: TimerTask!, p1: Long): Unit defined in java.util.Timer\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat did I wrong?

Thanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso see [this][1] for the explanation of how the weights work \r\n\r\nThe following is a SCALA code from the implementation of the calculation of the rawPredictions vector. It seems that `tree.rootNode.predictImpl(features).impurityStats.stats` is what I would would want to have access to.\r\n\r\n```\r\n override protected def predictRaw(features: Vector): Vector = {\r\n    // TODO: When we add a generic Bagging class, handle transform there: SPARK-7128\r\n    // Classifies using majority votes.\r\n    // Ignore the tree weights since all are 1.0 for now.\r\n    val votes = Array.fill[Double](numClasses)(0.0)\r\n    _trees.view.foreach { tree =&gt;\r\n      val classCounts: Array[Double] = tree.rootNode.predictImpl(features).impurityStats.stats\r\n      val total = classCounts.sum\r\n      if (total != 0) {\r\n        var i = 0\r\n        while (i &lt; numClasses) {\r\n          votes(i) += classCounts(i) / total\r\n          i += 1\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    Vectors.dense(votes)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\nEDIT:\r\nIn case acessing the impurityStats is not possible from pySpark, is it possible to extract the individual classification tree models from the random forest model in order to recalculate the equivalents of impuritySats manually?\r\n\r\nEDIT 2:\r\nI managed to get the impurity stats using a workaround presented [here][2] \r\nJudging by the Scala code and the results I get from this workaround I should be able to get the correct probabilities simply by using the impurity stats from the root node as weights.

And since `&quot;false&quot;` is actually truthy because it is a string of non-zero length, your div will always be visible.\r\n\r\n## Quick solution: Perform string comparison\r\n\r\nIf you want to keep your code as-is, and understanding that you are looking at string values instead of boolean stored in `visible`, updating your template to use `v-show=&quot;visible === &#39;true&#39;&quot;` will work.\r\n\r\n**Note:** I do not encourage this method though, because this is a code smell (see further below for a better solution).\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    new Vue({\r\n      el: &quot;#helloWorldApp&quot;,\r\n      data: {\r\n        visible: &#39;true&#39;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/vue/2.5.17/vue.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;helloWorldApp&quot;&gt;\r\n                  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; v-model=&quot;visible&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; name=&quot;optradio&quot;&gt;hide\r\n                  &lt;input type=&quot;radio&quot; v-model=&quot;visible&quot; value=&quot;false&quot; name=&quot;optradio&quot;&gt;show\r\n      &lt;div v-show=&quot;visible === &#39;true&#39;&quot;&gt;\r\n        Hello World\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;p&gt;\r\n       {{visible}}\r\n      &lt;/p&gt; \r\n\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\n## A better solution: use checkbox for binary state toggling\r\n\r\nThis brings us to another issue: since you are toggling a property, a radio button is not the best UI to do that.
