following code examples from the book *Web Development with Clojure, 3rd Edition*. Currently running through the examples for using ClojureScript to create a single page application with Reagent and Ajax. The compiled Javascript runs fine until I try to send data from a form to the server. This is *supposed* to break, because I haven&#39;t added in any of the Ajax code to attach a csrf token to the post request, and the author wants to walk through how the js console can be used for logging in development, but it&#39;s not breaking as expected. I should receive something like this:\r\n\r\n        error:{:status 403,\r\n          :status-text &quot;Forbidden&quot;,\r\n          :failure :error,\r\n          :response &quot;&lt;h1&gt;Invalid anti-forgery token&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve made sure that I&#39;m running up to date on all of my dependencies and plugins.

It used to be true in the experimental phase, and you really could get swallow exceptions if you weren&#39;t very pedantic.\r\n\r\nThe release version of coroutines acquired an additional key component: _structured concurrency_. When following the simple guidelines not to use `GlobalScope` and similar, your code will automatically be organized such that each coroutine has a parent and there&#39;s a well-defined scope within which all coroutines must complete either normally or abruptly, and the owner of that scope can await its completion, getting the exception that caused the abnormal completion.\r\n\r\nWithin this new discipline, `launch` and `async` are on the same footing. If an exception thrown inside one of them escapes its top-level block, it goes on to cancel the coroutine, notify the parent of this, and then the parent may opt to cancel all the other children so that the whole scope ends prematurely.\r\n\r\nNote that getting an exception from the `await` call is an entirely different mechanism. The thing you `await` on is not the `async` block itself, but a standalone object of type `Deferred`, which is identical to Java&#39;s `Future` except that `await` suspends instead of blocks. The `async` block, upon completion, always does the same: it completes the `Deferred` with either the return value or the exception. You may retrieve that result from anywhere you pass the `Deferred`, it&#39;s completely decoupled from the destiny of the `async` coroutine.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983244/android-kotlin-coroutine-await-might-silently-drop-exceptions/57990107#57990107","title":"Android kotlin coroutine: await might silently drop exceptions"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1047,"user_id":792632,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":86,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2ef3ed0c4374cf7e12992fbf0b7dac7c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"dominik","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/792632/dominik"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569526584,"creation_date":1569526584,"answer_id":58123637,"question_id":57983244,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58123637","body_markdown":"Ok, I found an example which is in line with Marko&#39;s answer concerning structured concurrency.

trying to create some sub functions that will be used to create fully configured products for my customer&#39;s database system.  One of the functions is to calculate the list price and discounted price of the item based on a set of arguments.  Since different types of items are created by different functions, but the way that the prices are calculated is essentially the same, I want one function that calculates the list price and discounted price for all my different types of items.\r\n\r\nMy main function (lets call it create_item) is successfully sending arguments to my sub function (lets call it calculate_price) and my sub function is successfully sending back the list price and discounted price in a table.  What I&#39;m having trouble with is how I store those results in a record in the main function.\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_item(\r\n          integer, \r\n          integer)\r\nReturns VOID\r\nLANGUAGE &#39;plpgsql&#39;\r\n\r\nAS $BODY$\r\n\r\nDECLARE\r\n\r\naccessory_price alias for $1;\r\ncustomer_discount alias for $2;\r\nlist_price numeric;\r\ndiscounted_price numeric;\r\nreturnRecord record;\r\n\r\nBEGIN\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM calculate_price(accessory_price, customer_discount) INTO returnRecord;\r\n\r\nlist_price = SELECT list_price FROM returnRecord;\r\ndiscounted_price = SELECT discounted_price FROM returnRecord;\r\n\r\nEND;\r\n\r\n$BODY$;\r\n\r\n----------END OF MAIN FUNCTION\r\n\r\n----------BEGINNING OF SUB FUNCTION\r\n\r\nCREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_price(\r\n          integer, \r\n          integer)\r\nRETURNS TABLE (\r\n      list_price numeric,\r\n      discounted_price numeric) \r\nLANGUAGE &#39;plpgsql&#39;\r\n\r\nAS $BODY$\r\n\r\nDECLARE\r\n\r\naccessory_price alias for $1;\r\ncustomer_discount alias for $2;\r\nlist_price numeric;\r\ndiscounted_price numeric;\r\n\r\n---*** INSERT LOGIC USED TO CALCULATE LIST_PRICE BASED ON VARIABLES\r\n---*** INSERT LOGIC USED TO CALCULATE DISCOUNTED_PRICE BASED ON LIST_PRICE AND VARIABLES\r\n\r\nRETURN QUERY SELECT list_price, discounted_price;\r\n\r\nEND;\r\n\r\n$BODY$\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far this almost works.  I can check the variables throughout the process by raising notices and everything calculates correctly, but when I try to store the results of calculate_price into the returnRecord I get an error that &quot;the returned results have no place to be stored&quot; or something like that (sorry I can&#39;t remember the exact verbiage).  Any help on what I&#39;m doing wrong?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983236/storing-postgres-function-results-in-a-record","title":"Storing postgres function results in a record"},{"tags":["reactjs","typescript","jestjs","enzyme"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":9453618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/225c78f6d01709e74f79da72f59836d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9453618/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568764457,"post_id":57983267,"comment_id":102375637,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983235/testing-props-that-are-being-passed-down-to-child-component/57983267#comment102375637_57983267"},{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14,"user_id":9453618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/225c78f6d01709e74f79da72f59836d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9453618/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568764648,"post_id":57983267,"comment_id":102375669,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983235/testing-props-that-are-being-passed-down-to-child-component/57983267#comment102375669_57983267"},{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14,"user_id":9453618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/225c78f6d01709e74f79da72f59836d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9453618/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568764735,"post_id":57983267,"comment_id":102375684,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983235/testing-props-that-are-being-passed-down-to-child-component/57983267#comment102375684_57983267"},{"owner":{"reputation":14,"user_id":9453618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/225c78f6d01709e74f79da72f59836d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9453618/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568765247,"post_id":57983267,"comment_id":102375776,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983235/testing-props-that-are-being-passed-down-to-child-component/57983267#comment102375776_57983267"},{"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":14,"user_id":9453618,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/225c78f6d01709e74f79da72f59836d5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Dan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9453618/dan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568765299,"post_id":57983267,"comment_id":102375784,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983235/testing-props-that-are-being-passed-down-to-child-component/57983267#comment102375784_57983267"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":2224,"user_id":10549165,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ru0fuSgoy48/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ABtNlbBUbEb_6QrDJx3bi7d7ClE-7i6UFg/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Rutherford Wonkington","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10549165/rutherford-wonkington"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568764006,"creation_date":1568764006,"answer_id":57983267,"question_id":57983235,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57983267","body_markdown":"Not 100%, but try removing your ```find``` method.

Data comes with elements AND content (only text, like &quot;born 2007&quot;). I have tried to wrap these with jQuery `wrap()` and `wrapAll` method, but it doesn&#39;t wrap it correctly. So I want to wrap all elements and content into a single `div` so I can style it more easily.\r\n\r\nHow can I achieve this? I need to wrap everything UNTIL certain `class` is found. I&#39;ve also tried jQuery `parentsUntil()` method but that didn&#39;t work either. I have no idea how to achieve this so I need your help.\r\n\r\nExample data (html that prints to my page):\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n        &lt;b class=&quot;big_text&quot;&gt;Title&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        &quot;some content after title&amp;nbsp;&quot;\r\n        &lt;b&gt;Subtitle content here&lt;/b&gt;\r\n        &lt;br /&gt;\r\n        &lt;span

     &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\nSo that&#39;s the problem, I have to wrap everything into a `div` until `&lt;div class=&quot;picture&quot;&gt;` appears.\r\n\r\nThis did not work:\r\n\r\n     $(&quot;.container&quot;).children().nextUntil(&quot;.picture&quot;).wrapAll(&quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&quot;);\r\n\r\nThis would be the desired result:\r\n    \r\n    &lt;div

Thus you need to drop usage of JSON in the continuous aggregate or reconsider types, so they fit NUMERIC field of JSON (single precision).\r\n\r\nSince the row is limited to 8160 bytes, around 1000 fields can fit. This can be enough to fit all your columns if you avoid materialising aggregates, which can be calculated later. For example, `average` can be calculated from `sum` and `countgood`. While `countbad` and `countuncertain` contains no information in your example.\r\n\r\nIf the OP query is used for creating continuous aggregate, it can be rewritten into:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  &quot;deviceId&quot;,\r\n  time_bucket(&#39;1 hours&#39;, &quot;time&quot;) as starttime,\r\n  max(&quot;voltage_an&quot;) as maxvalue,\r\n  min(&quot;voltage_an&quot;) as minvalue,\r\n  sum(&quot;voltage_an&quot;) as sum,\r\n  first(&quot;voltage_an&quot;, &quot;time&quot;) as firstvalue,\r\n  min(&quot;time&quot; AT TIME ZONE &#39;UTC&#39;) as firsttime,\r\n  max(&quot;time&quot; AT TIME ZONE &#39;UTC&#39;) as lasttime,\r\n  last(&quot;voltage_an&quot;, &quot;time&quot;) as lastvalue,\r\n  stddev_pop(&quot;voltage_an&quot;) as sd,\r\n  COUNT(*) countgood,\r\n  ...\r\nFROM\r\n  &quot;PAC4200_Metering&quot;\r\nGROUP BY\r\n  &quot;deviceId&quot;,\r\n  starttime\r\n```\r\nIf `voltage_an` is one of 108 different values and 8 aggregates are calculated above, it will be 108*8*8 + 3*8 = 6912 + 24 = 6936 bytes max.\r\n\r\nThen you can get the same result as original query from the continuous aggregate:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  &quot;deviceId&quot;,\r\n  starttime,\r\n  json_build_object(\r\n   &#39;average&#39;, &quot;sum&quot;/&quot;countgood&quot;,\r\n   &#39;maxvalue&#39;, &quot;maxvalue&quot;,\r\n   &#39;minvalue&#39;, &quot;minvalue&quot;,\r\n   &#39;sum&#39;, &quot;sum&quot;,\r\n   &#39;firstvalue&#39;, &quot;firstvalue&quot;,\r\n   &#39;firsttime&#39;, &quot;firsttime&quot;,\r\n   &#39;lasttime&#39;, &quot;lasttime&quot;,\r\n   &#39;lastvalue&#39;, &quot;lastvalue&quot;,\r\n   &#39;sd&#39;, &quot;sd&quot;,\r\n   &#39;countgood&#39;, &quot;countgood&quot;,\r\n   &#39;countbad&#39;, 0,\r\n   &#39;countuncertain&#39;, 0\r\n  ) AS &quot;voltage_an&quot;\r\n  ...\r\nFROM\r\n  CAGG\r\n```\r\nIt is also possible to define several continuous aggregates and then join them.\r\n\r\nI would recommend to think carefully how much information needs to be materialised as nothing comes for free. E.g., it occupies space. Furthermore, having each row occupying entire 8K page can affect efficiency of PostgreSQL further.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983208/timescaledb-materialized-row-is-too-big/57988718#57988718","title":"TimeScaleDB materialized row is too big"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":9298801,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zSfrl67PKAE/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAmg0/YP5kBH7AuvM/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Alexander Buczynsky","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9298801/alexander-buczynsky"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":50,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568797019,"creation_date":1568763260,"question_id":57983208,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983208","body_markdown":"# Summary\r\nI am stuck on a problem where the row limit on a Materialized View is exceeding the maximum allowed in a Postgres Database.\r\n\r\n# Description\r\n\r\nThe table named `PAC4200_Metering` has 108 fields that are all double precision fields.

This worked!!  Thus, my view syntax is as per below:\r\n\r\n    @inherits \r\n    DotNetNuke.Web.Mvc.Framework.DnnWebViewPage\r\n    &lt;DotNetNuke.Collections.PagedList&lt;SocialBodega.Onboarding.\r\n    Models.Onboarding&gt;&gt;\r\n\r\n    @using System.Linq\r\n    @using System.Text.RegularExpressions\r\n    @using DotNetNuke.Collections\r\n    @using DotNetNuke.Entities.Urls\r\n    @using DotNetNuke.Web.Mvc.Helpers\r\n\r\n    &lt;div id=&quot;Onboarding-@Dnn.ModuleContext.ModuleId&quot;&gt;\r\n    @if (Model == null|| !Model.Any())\r\n\r\n        {\r\n        &lt;p&gt;@Dnn.LocalizeString(&quot;NoSignups&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        &lt;ul&gt;\r\n            @foreach (var onboarding in Model)\r\n            {\r\n                &lt;li&gt;\r\n                    &lt;h3&gt;@onboarding.FirstName&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n                    &lt;div&gt;@onboarding.OnboardingId&lt;/div&gt;\r\n                    @{\r\n                        if (Dnn.ModuleContext.IsEditable)\r\n                        {\r\n                            &lt;div&gt;\r\n                                &lt;a href=&quot;@Url.Action(&quot;Edit&quot;,&quot;Signup&quot;, new{ctl = &quot;Edit&quot;, onboardingId = onboarding.OnboardingId, })&quot;&gt;@Dnn.LocalizeString(&quot;EditItem&quot;)&lt;/a&gt;\r\n                            &lt;/div&gt;\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                &lt;/li&gt;\r\n            }\r\n        &lt;/ul&gt;\r\n    }\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    @*@Html.Label(&quot;Testing 123&quot;);*@\r\n\r\nWhen I build the solution, it succeeds but I do receive 16 error messages in Visual Studio 2019 to the effect of:\r\n\r\n    Error\tCS0012\tThe type &#39;WebViewPage&lt;&gt;&#39; is defined in an assembly that is \r\n    not referenced.

desired?\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983198/how-to-resolve-dnn-custom-module-not-rendering","title":"How to Resolve DNN Custom Module Not

The problem is that, there is an edge case here when, after the promise is resolved, the operation gets forwarded without the proper headers set, leading to another call that could potentially be unauthenticated. I feel the trick here is pretty straightforward, but I can&#39;t seem to figure it out. Is there a way to return the results from a promise back up to the enclosed function? I haven&#39;t found much luck regarding this, but perhaps there is another way. Here is the code for setting up my middleware and Apollo client:\r\n\r\n    const authLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) =&gt; {\r\n      operation.setContext(({ headers = {} }) =&gt; {\r\n        const token = localStorage.getItem(&#39;token&#39;);\r\n        const tokenExp = token ? decodeJWT(token).exp : null;\r\n        const currentTime = Date.now() / 1000;\r\n        \r\n        if(token &amp;&amp; tokenExp &gt;= currentTime) {\r\n          // Check if token is expired. If so, get a new one and THEN\r\n          // move forward\r\n          headers = { ...headers,authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : &quot;&quot;, };\r\n          return { headers };\r\n        } else {\r\n    \r\n        // TODO: This would be replaced with the token service that actually\r\n        // takes an expired token and sends back a valid one\r\n        return

       })\r\n          .then(({ data: { login: { token } }}) =&gt; {\r\n            // Put updated token in storage\r\n            localStorage.setItem(&#39;token&#39;, token);\r\n            headers = { ...headers,authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : &quot;&quot;, };\r\n            return { headers };\r\n          });\r\n        }\r\n      });\r\n      return forward(operation);\r\n

(Reporting is a bonus) I understand that 1 way of accomplishing this task of persisting communication history within the CRM is to create a custom activity as described here\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/custom-activities\r\n\r\nHowever, I need some clarification on how the new activity is associated with leads, opportunities, and accounts. For example, is it possible to have an activity associated with a lead, but no opportunity, nor any matching accounts? At the same time, is it possible to have an activity that is associated with a lead, an opportunity, and an account?\r\n\r\nHow are end users of CRM Dynamics viewing these types of historical messages within the UI? \r\n\r\nPerhaps the answer to this is that a lead can be associated with an opportunity, and thus activity related to a lead could indirectly be associated with an opportunity from that connection?\r\n\r\nI tested this by creating a lead,creating activity for that lead, then converting that lead into an opportunity. In this case, the activity added to the lead entity was visible within the opportunity entity form. However, When I created activity within the opportunity entity form, this activity did Not lead to activity viewable within the lead entity form. \r\n\r\nDo I need to always save activity to a lead entity then?\r\n This seems like the only method in order to ensure that custom activity is always visible regardless of where the lead/opportunity/account is in the lifecycle.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983189/when-creating-new-crm-dynamics-custom-activity-entity-is-the-new-activity-assoc","title":"When creating new CRM Dynamics custom activity entity, is the new activity associated with lead, opportunity, and account?"},{"tags":["amazon-web-services","apache-spark","airflow-scheduler"],"owner":{"reputation":182,"user_id":6306852,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":58,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e95f3fddd34e89a6dea591bdeac42cf0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sri","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6306852/sri"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":6,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568763132,"creation_date":1568763132,"question_id":57983188,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983188","body_markdown":"Through Airflow DAG I am spinning up the AWS cluster.

Essentially making all graphql request going from the client to my app server, which then goes to the graphql server under the hood?\r\n - Any other recommendations how to properly set this up?  I&#39;m at a complete loss here\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/admin/manage-cookies","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983181/firebase-authentication-with-ssr-apollo-react-app","title":"Firebase authentication with SSR apollo react app"},{"tags":["persistence","android-notifications","foreground-service"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":171,"user_id":2852119,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c685dac049e5324a1be4047f420c6d68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KingBryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852119/kingbryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569412985,"post_id":57983175,"comment_id":102587694,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983175/android-8-1-really-persistent-foreground-service-notification#comment102587694_57983175"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11064470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a5ff86773db95d52ea9db967de48719?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11064470","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11064470/user11064470"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":171,"user_id":2852119,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":36,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c685dac049e5324a1be4047f420c6d68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"KingBryan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2852119/kingbryan"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569517435,"post_id":57983175,"comment_id":102631800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983175/android-8-1-really-persistent-foreground-service-notification#comment102631800_57983175"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11064470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a5ff86773db95d52ea9db967de48719?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11064470","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11064470/user11064470"},"last_editor":{"reputation":11,"user_id":11064470,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6a5ff86773db95d52ea9db967de48719?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user11064470","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11064470/user11064470"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":26,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569025784,"creation_date":1568763023,"last_edit_date":1569025784,"question_id":57983175,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983175","body_markdown":"I&#39;m updating my Android app to work with 8.1 from 7.

the below is my own intrepretation of what I think is a bug on Chrome related to flexbox and percentage height&lt;/sup&gt;\r\n\r\nHere is a more simplified example of your issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: true console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n      height: 100px;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      flex-direction: column;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    body .tall .nested-tall {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      background-color: yellow;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    button:hover {\r\n      border-color: black;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;tall&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;nested-tall&quot;&gt;\r\n        I am Tall\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div style=&quot;height:1px&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;button&gt;Hover me&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNote how on hovering you are increasing the size by exactly `1px` which is the size of the overflowing div. To be more accurate, it&#39;s the total overflowing size (`100% + 1px - 100%`).\r\n\r\nWhen you add a `border-color` to the button you change it&#39;s layout so you will trigger a reflow of the page (exactly like if you resize the screen). This will trigger the calculation of the `height:100%` again the trick is here.  \r\n\r\nThe parent element don&#39;t have any height specified so technically the use of `100%` on the child element should fail (it&#39;s the case on Firefox) but Chrome is calculating this considering the height of the parent BUT the height of the parent is calculated based on the content (we have a cycle here). Initially, we have the size of the parent element equal to the size of the text and `1px` then the nested div will take that size as its own (due to the `height:100%`) and we will have our overflowing `1px`.\r\n\r\nNow imagine the next iteration. the size of the parent is now bigger with `1px` from the intial size and this one will be used to calculate the `height:100%` of the text and again `1px` of overflow and so on. \r\n\r\nThis is indeed very odd and should be considered as a *serious* **bug**. The use of `height:100%` in this case should either fall to `auto` or consider the initial layout without considering different values each time.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nYour other snippets don&#39;t trigger this behivor because in some of them you are no more changing the layout of the button (like changing the color or having the border intially) and in one of them you have an empty div overflowing so each time you will add `0px` and nothing will happen.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983172/child-element-overflow-results-in-button-in-different-container-running-away-fro/57983446#57983446","title":"Child element overflow results in button in different container running away from mouse when hovered"}],"owner":{"reputation":2245,"user_id":11081214,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0b53d0cefd959372f49e84b943a1187f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Snow","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11081214/snow"},"last_editor":{"reputation":107381,"user_id":8620333,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WSmLn.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Temani Afif","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8620333/temani-afif"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57983446,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568767440,"creation_date":1568762961,"last_edit_date":1568765994,"question_id":57983172,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983172","body_markdown":"See the below snippet. Whenever the mouse is moved over the button, the `.nested-tall` expands for some reason, and the whole `.tall` container resizes, so the button is no longer where the mouse is, and is not clickable, at least with the mouse.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    body {\r\n      position: fixed; /* Just for the sake of a minimal example */\r\n      height: 70%;\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      flex-direction: column;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    body .tall {\r\n      flex-grow: 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    body .tall .nested-tall {\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      background-color: yellow;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    button:hover {\r\n      border-color: black;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;div class=&quot;tall&quot;&gt;\r\n      &lt;div class=&quot;nested-tall&quot;&gt;\r\n        I am Tall\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n      &lt;div&gt;\r\n        I am invisible due to overflow\r\n      &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;/div&gt;\r\n    &lt;button&gt;Hover me&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThe solution is simple: don&#39;t have the children overflow their `.tall` container.

are a few problems with the code:\r\n\r\n**1. The `while` condition is always true**\r\n\r\n    while (colSel != &quot;Red&quot; || gClas != &quot;Blue&quot; || gClas != &quot;Green&quot;)\r\n\r\nThe way the [`||` operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators#conditional-logical-or-operator-) (OR operator) works is that it evaluates each expression and returns `true` as soon as one of them evaluates to `true`. Since `colSel` cannot be more than one of the color strings, the condition will return `true` and the `while` loop will continue.\r\n\r\nThe operator you&#39;re looking for instead is the [`&amp;&amp;` operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators#conditional-logical-and-operator-) (AND operator), which returns `true` only if ALL the expressions return `true`, otherwise it returns `false`.\r\n\r\n**2. You&#39;re calling `ToLower` on the input and comparing it to strings with upper-case characters**&lt;br&gt;So once again, none of the strings are going to match your comparisons. Using lower-case strings would be one way to handle this.\r\n\r\n**3. There is a `break` statement inside the loop**&lt;br&gt;This means *&quot;exit the loop immediately&quot;*. It&#39;s counterpart is `continue` which means *&quot;stop executing the current iteration and start the loop again&quot;*. But you don&#39;t need either of these, since a `while` loop will automatically continue until the condition returns `false`.\r\n\r\nSo, to fix your code, you can do something like:\r\n\r\n    Console.Write(&quot;Select Colour (Red / Blue / Green): &quot;);\r\n    string colSel = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();\r\n\r\n    while (colSel != &quot;red&quot; &amp;&amp; colSel != &quot;blue&quot; &amp;&amp; colSel != &quot;green&quot;)\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t catch that...&quot;);\r\n        Console.Write(&quot;Select Colour (Red / Blue / Green): &quot;);\r\n        colSel = Console.ReadLine().ToLower();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Alright &quot; + colSel + &quot;, good. &quot;);\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can make the code a little easier to maintain (and improve the string comparison) by using an array (or list) of valid values that you compare the input to. This allows you to dynamically display the valid values (using `string.Join` on the array) and dynamically validate the input (by checking if `values.Contains` the input, using a case-insensitive comparer). But it may be a little advanced at this point.\r\n\r\nTo try it out, just add any strings you want to the array, and notice how the prompt changes and the validation handles the new addition automatically:\r\n\r\n    // Add any valid values to this array\r\n    var validValues = new[] {&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;};\r\n    var prompt = $&quot;Select Colour ({string.Join(&quot; / &quot;, validValues)}): &quot;;\r\n\r\n    Console.Write(prompt);\r\n    string userInput = Console.ReadLine();\r\n\r\n    while (!validValues.Contains(userInput, StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine($&quot;Sorry, &#39;{userInput}&#39; is not a valid value.&quot;);\r\n        Console.Write(prompt);\r\n        userInput = Console.ReadLine();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Alright &quot; + userInput + &quot;, good. &quot;);","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983166/how-can-i-ignore-a-while-loop-if-the-console-readline-matches-a-defined-inpu/57983339#57983339","title":"How can I ignore a &#39;while-loop&#39; if the Console.ReadLine() matches a defined input + only loops once when invalid input"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12082115,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8e8dc1d0afd73e5020fc3d517f53d39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Craig1990","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12082115/craig1990"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12082115,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b8e8dc1d0afd73e5020fc3d517f53d39?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Craig1990","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12082115/craig1990"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":47,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":2,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568879077,"creation_date":1568762908,"last_edit_date":1568879077,"question_id":57983166,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983166","body_markdown":"I&#39;m telling the user to key one of three possible colours.

to my test, we can not use the command ```Write-SqlTableData``` to import CSV file to Azure SQL and we just can use it to import CSV file to on-premise SQL\r\n[![enter image description

The good news is that I was able to get it working.  The bad news is that I don&#39;t have any idea what did it.  After many hours trying to resolve it, I decided to create a new workspace from scratch and re-apply my changes manually. I ran it and the fault response finally threw an exception in my client &quot;faultCode argument for createFault was passed NULL&quot; which confirmed my prior observation. I was able to find info online that suggested that the response might not be inline with the schema.  I validated the XML payload against the schema and it was valid.  I rebuilt the project with maven from the command prompt (outside of eclipse) and restarted the retested the application.  The attributes of the fault where now populated correctly and my client is able to handle faults as expected.  My only advise here for those developing in eclipse is that if all else fails, build a new workspace and see if that helps.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983152/soap-fault-recieved-by-jax-ws-client-is-not-throwing-exception/58035798#58035798","title":"SOAP Fault recieved by JAX-WS Client is not throwing Exception"}],"owner":{"reputation":20,"user_id":1867012,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f7b65bcdff3ba3775628c3b535f34545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"user1867012","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1867012/user1867012"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":45,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569018659,"creation_date":1568762762,"question_id":57983152,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983152","body_markdown":"I refactored a JAX-WS client to run on Java11 (from Java8).  The refactored code now uses jax-ws\\jaxb from jaxws-rt-2.3.2.jar instead of the java8 rt.jar.  The client is able to handle responses successfully when there isn&#39;t a fault but when a fault is received, it does NOT throw an Exception.\r\n\r\nI have both old and new apps in 2 eclipse workspaces.  cxf-codegen-plugin 3.3.1 was used to generate the client artifacts in both.  In debug mode, I am able to see that the same request is handled differently in both.  While unmarshalling the response, the Java11 workspace creates the SOAP11Fault object w/o setting any of the object attributes (faultcode, faultstring, detail).  This is causing the SOAPFaultBuilder.createException() method to attempt to return a ProtcolException (which it does not find).  The Java8 workspace creates the SOAP11Fault with the necessary attributes and causes the SOAPFaultBuilder.createException() method to handle the exception correctly.  It appears that jaxb is not unmarshalling the XML message correctly in the jaxws-rt distribution.\r\n\r\nW:\r\n```\r\n&lt;wsdl:definitions xmlns:soap=&quot;http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/soap/&quot;

You can have nested optionals, like `Optional&lt;Optional&lt;Int&gt;&gt;` (a.k.a. `Int??)`. A nested optional like this has possible three values. To illustrate their difference, imagine the result of `array.first`, where `array` has type `Array&lt;Optional&lt;Optional&lt;Int&gt;&gt;`:\r\n\r\n1. `Optional.some(Optional.some(someWrappedValue))`, which is just the &quot;non-nil&quot; case, with a payload of `someWrappedValue`. In the context of `array.first`, that means the array is non-empty, and the first element is non-nil value `someWrappedValue` (of type `Int`).\r\n\r\n2. `Optional.some(Optional.none)`, which is a non-nil optional containing a `nil`. In the context of `array.first`, that means ten array is non-empty, and the first element is itself `nil`.\r\n\r\n3. `Optional.none`, which is just a `nil` optional. In the context of `array.first`, that means the array is empty, and there is no first element.\r\n\r\nNote the different between case 2 and case 3. &quot;Where&quot; the nil is &quot;found&quot; along the chain has a semantic difference. `Optional.none` (a.k.a. nil) means there are no elements, which is semantically different to `Optional.some(Optional.none)`, which means there *are* elements, but the first of them is actually `nil`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### The precise meaning of `nil`\r\n\r\nSecondly, `nil` is a shorthand for `Optional&lt;T&gt;.none`, where `T` is inferred from the context. For example, that&#39;s why `let x = nil` is illegal, because the type inference system has no clues as to what value of `T` is appropriate.\r\n\r\nNote that `nil` on its own is inferred to a `none` at the &quot;earliest&quot; (&quot;outermost&quot;) level of optionality. (Case 3, in the list above)\r\n\r\n### Assign nil through a dictionary subscript\r\n\r\nThirdly, assigning `nil` to a Dictionary through a subscript erases the value for the given key.\r\n\r\n### Putting it together\r\n\r\nGiven these three points, we can consider your example. The subscript of a dictionary is &quot;one layer more optional&quot; than the `Value` generic type of the dictionary. E.g. for a dict of type `[Int: Int]`, the return type of the subscript operator is `V?`, and correspondingly, you can assign `Int?`.\r\n\r\nNow consider your dictionary, of type `[Int: Int?]`. The subscript takes/returns an `Int??`. Let&#39;s consider the three possible cases in context, as before:\r\n\r\n 1. Assigning a value of type `Optional.some(Optional.some(someWrappedValue))` makes the dict store a value of `someWrappedValue` for the key, as an `Int?`. This is what&#39;s happening when you write `$0[$1] = 1` (Swift is implicitly promoting `1` to `Optional.some(Optional.some(1))`.\r\n\r\n 2. Assigning a value of type `Optional.some(Optional.none)` makes the dict store a value of `nil` for the key, as an `Int?`. This is the part you were missing.\r\n\r\n 3. Assigning a value of type `Optional.none` makes the dict erase any value that might have existed for the key. This is what&#39;s happening when you write `$0[$1] = nil`\r\n\r\n\r\nSo to make this code give your designed outcome, you need to supply a value of the second type. You can do this with:\r\n\r\n    [1,2,3].reduce(into: [Int:Int?]()) { $0[$1] = Optional.some(nil) }\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983093/reducing-a-swift-array-to-intint-with-nil-initializer-is-empty/57983607#57983607","title":"Reducing a Swift array to [Int:Int?] with nil initializer is empty"}],"owner":{"reputation":38,"user_id":8513575,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3825edff7f478a0f2968afb7b018e232?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"ElectricPenguin","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8513575/electricpenguin"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57983370,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568769984,"creation_date":1568762208,"question_id":57983093,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983093","body_markdown":"Why does reducing an array into a hash with the keys as array values and the value as nil give an empty result?\r\n\r\n``` swift\r\n[1,2,3].reduce(into: [Int:Int?](), { $0[$1] = nil })\r\n[1,2,3].reduce(into: [Int:Int?](), { $0[$1] = 1 })\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these should have 3 entries, right?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983093/reducing-a-swift-array-to-intint-with-nil-initializer-is-empty","title":"Reducing a Swift array to [Int:Int?] with nil initializer is empty"},{"tags":["python-3.x","microsoft-graph","microsoft-graph-security"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12081468,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/130cf5a06a3f3df890157dd2f7f0c4f5?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Harikrishna","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12081468/harikrishna"},"last_editor":{"reputation":22866,"user_id":105518,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f1e47ca9372faad8084cbaf9f90c6a75?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Marc LaFleur","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/105518/marc-lafleur"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":46,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569518176,"creation_date":1568762139,"last_edit_date":1568834124,"question_id":57983090,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983090","body_markdown":"I am working on Microsoft Graph API (python3).

would not recommend to build your own authentication scheme, nor deploy your own cryptographic functions. Nowadays the industry standard for API authentication and authorization is [OAuth 2.0][1], it provides all the requirements you&#39;ve described in a robust but rather simple to implement solution.\r\n\r\nIf the mentioned application does not require any of the OAuth 2.0 authorization concepts, using [OpenID Connect][2] is certainly a great approach. OpenID Connect is a protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0: \r\n\r\n&gt; It allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the\r\n&gt; authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to\r\n&gt; obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an\r\n&gt; interoperable and REST-like manner.\r\n\r\nAPI authentication technologies are widely available in different forms, even [SAML 2.0][3] can be implemented for such scenarios (more infrastructure is required), anyhow for what you have described, OpenID Connect certainly cover all requirements.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

The elements in A can be choosen 4 diffrent ways and B 3 giving 4x3=12 combinations.\r\n\r\nI just can`t see why the code above accomplishes this.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57983081/need-help-understanding-code-execution-for-nested-for-loop","title":"Need help understanding code execution, for nested for loop"},{"tags":["python","selenium"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12003009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/627c796b042725ed52c4b1861eacfaed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sarahrezq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003009/sarahrezq"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12003009,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/627c796b042725ed52c4b1861eacfaed?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"sarahrezq","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12003009/sarahrezq"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":30,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568763663,"creation_date":1568761970,"last_edit_date":1568763663,"question_id":57983080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57983080","body_markdown":"[enter image description here][1]i want to khow how to save the firefox profile created by the function f() in the file named &quot;mon_dossier&quot;

(_edits in italics_)\r\n\r\n_Our company has a deployed application written in VB6.  Since VB6 development is no longer officially supported in Windows, our company made the decision to port our VB6 application to VB.NET._  \r\n\r\n(Prior to this edit, I had mentioned that the project was converted to VB.NET using VS 2015.  This was incorrect, I discovered that my coworker had actually performed the conversion using VS 2008, and I was working on the 2008 project in 2015.)\r\n\r\n_So we are now working with the VB.NET conversion in VS2015.  As many of us know, the VS 2008 converter does an incomplete job porting VB6 code to VB.NET code so there are many, many errors to sort through (as of this writing, all compile errors are fixed)._  In particular, though, I&#39;m trying to open the various forms for the project in the Designer so I can see and work with them.  The designer specifically is reporting the error:\r\n\r\n    Could not resolve mscorlib for target framework &#39;.NETFramework,Version=v2.0&#39;.
