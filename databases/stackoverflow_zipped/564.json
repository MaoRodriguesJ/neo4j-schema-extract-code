The presence of ICU affects sort()\r\nresults on strings.\r\n\r\nApparently, R 3.6.0 build on Ubuntu 16.04 does not include ICU support; the\r\nbuild on 18.04 does. This explains why sort() function on strings\r\ngives different results on the two platforms.\r\n\r\nTo find out if your R build uses ICU, type (example given for Ubuntu\r\n16.04, R 3.6.0 build):\r\n```\r\n&gt; icuGetCollate()\r\n[1] &quot;ICU not in use&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to use ASCII collating sequence, issue this command\r\n```\r\nSys.setlocale(category = &quot;LC_COLLATE&quot;, locale = &quot;C&quot;)\r\n```\r\nbefore sort(). This will yield identical results across operating systems.\r\n\r\nIdeally, sessionInfo() should say whether R uses ICU or not.

Because querying and returning 10,000 rows to get only 100 is not efficient?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406294/return-subset-of-redis-values-matching-specific-property","title":"Return subset of Redis Values matching specific property?"},{"tags":["php","laravel-5"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":502,"user_id":4558232,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":60,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6Din.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Vishal Tarkar","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4558232/vishal-tarkar"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571218523,"post_id":58406291,"comment_id":103163895,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406291/e-unable-to-locate-package-php-intl-for-ubuntu-18#comment103163895_58406291"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7797484,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a0e30b68a55e2d42eedc3d5707f3e313?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"GeboHoka","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7797484/gebohoka"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6244,"user_id":534943,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f83f0fde2b9129daa3b0f01769055d6d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Styx","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/534943/styx"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571206515,"creation_date":1571203775,"last_edit_date":1571206515,"question_id":58406291,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58406291","body_markdown":"I have gone mad searching for an answer: Below is what I did, I tried even to enable repository but in vain: \r\n\r\nLook the error below.\r\n\r\n```it@ubuntu:/srv/www/pel$ sudo apt-get install php-intl\r\nReading package lists...

can authenticate with **jane**,**secret** against **admin** db, not **mydb**\r\n\r\nRunning `mongo -u jane -p secret` is equivalent to running `mongo -u jane -p secret -authenticationDatabase admin`. Check container logs to verify it.\r\n\r\nMONGO_INITDB_DATABASE is for different purpose.\r\n\r\nAs [docs][1] state:\r\n\r\n&gt; MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME, MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD These\r\n&gt; variables, used in conjunction, create a new user and set that user&#39;s\r\n&gt; password. This user is created in the **admin authentication database**\r\n&gt; and given the role of root, which is a &quot;superuser&quot; role.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE This variable allows you to specify the name of\r\n&gt; a database to be used for creation scripts in\r\n&gt; /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/*.js (see Initializing a fresh instance\r\n&gt; below). MongoDB is fundamentally designed for &quot;create on first use&quot;,\r\n&gt; so if you do not insert data with your JavaScript files, then no\r\n&gt; database is created.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; \r\n\r\n&gt; **Initializing a fresh** **instance** When a container is started for the first time it will execute files\r\n&gt; with extensions .sh and .js that are found in\r\n&gt; /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d. Files will be executed in alphabetical\r\n&gt; order. .js files will be executed by mongo using the database\r\n&gt; specified by the MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE variable, if it is present, or\r\n&gt; test otherwise. You may also switch databases within the .js script.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406236/user-not-found-on-mongodb-docker-image-with-authentication/58462095#58462095","title":"User not found on MongoDB Docker image with authentication"}],"owner":{"reputation":63298,"user_id":1333873,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7ae9b432531de46073888f1a49c2391c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Golo Roden","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1333873/golo-roden"},"comment_count":7,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58462095,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571475939,"creation_date":1571203343,"question_id":58406236,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58406236","body_markdown":"So I&#39;m trying to setup a MongoDB using the official [mongo Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo), version `4.2`.\r\n\r\nWhat I want to achieve is to use the server with authentication enabled, and I want to have a custom database with a custom user and password.\r\n\r\nSo, I&#39;m setting the following environment variables:\r\n\r\n    MONGO_INITDB_DATABASE: mydb\r\n    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME: jane\r\n    MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD: secret\r\n\r\nIn the documentation it states that if you provide the latter two environment variables, authentication is enabled automatically.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I then try to access the `mydb` database using the credentials `jane` and `secret`, all I get is an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSupported SASL mechanisms requested for unknown user &#39;jane@mydb&#39;\r\nSASL SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication failed for jane on mydb from client 172.17.0.1:54702 ; UserNotFound: Could not find user &quot;jane&quot; for db &quot;mydb&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is that?

So my question is are partial functions pure?\r\n\r\nYes, they are pure.\r\n\r\n`calcArea(Math.PI)` and `calcArea(Math.PI + 2)` have _independent [closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)_, what you&#39;re mistakenly referring to as\r\n\r\n&gt; some kind of global variable\r\n\r\nThis notion is incorrect. Each partial application does not share some sort of &quot;global closure&quot; with others. \r\n\r\nConsider the following example:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    const mult = x =&gt; y =&gt; x * y\r\n    const times5 = mult(5)\r\n\r\n    console.log(&#39;5 * 4 =&#39;, times5(4))\r\n\r\n    const times3 = mult(3)\r\n\r\n    console.log(&#39;3 * 6 =&#39;, times3(6))\r\n    console.log(&#39;5 * 6 =&#39;, times5(6))\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nNote that the definition `const times3 = mult(3)` does _not_ affect the closure created by `const times5 = mult(5)`. That is what is meant by _independent_.\r\n\r\n&gt; other function will change the results\r\n\r\nThis is demonstrated to be _false_ by the example above.\r\n\r\n&gt; So what&#39;s the point to partially apply the function\r\n\r\nThe answer is reusability through functional composition.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406233/functional-programming-partial-functions-and-global-scope/58406357#58406357","title":"Functional programming partial functions and global scope"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":2134,"user_id":2693928,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4c1419246c9c4d03a08f7c5db65303e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2693928","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2693928/user2693928"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571212487,"post_id":58406363,"comment_id":103160582,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406233/functional-programming-partial-functions-and-global-scope/58406363#comment103160582_58406363"},{"owner":{"reputation":2134,"user_id":2693928,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4c1419246c9c4d03a08f7c5db65303e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2693928","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2693928/user2693928"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571213633,"post_id":58406363,"comment_id":103161159,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406233/functional-programming-partial-functions-and-global-scope/58406363#comment103161159_58406363"},{"owner":{"reputation":1613,"user_id":8218652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubOaE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"giuseppedeponte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8218652/giuseppedeponte"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":2134,"user_id":2693928,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f4c1419246c9c4d03a08f7c5db65303e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user2693928","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2693928/user2693928"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571219076,"post_id":58406363,"comment_id":103164208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406233/functional-programming-partial-functions-and-global-scope/58406363#comment103164208_58406363"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1613,"user_id":8218652,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ubOaE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"giuseppedeponte","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8218652/giuseppedeponte"},"comment_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1571204178,"creation_date":1571204178,"answer_id":58406363,"question_id":58406233,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58406363","body_markdown":"I think the confusion comes from the fact that you have assigned two different functions to a `const` that has the same name.\r\n```\r\nconst calcArea = PI =&gt; radius =&gt; PI * radius * radius\r\nconst aFunction = calcArea(Math.PI)\r\nconst aDifferentFunction = calcArea(3.13)\r\n```\r\nThe two different functions `aFunction` &amp; `aDifferentFunction` are both pure, since they will both always return the same result given the same radius argument.\r\n\r\nOne possible advantage of defining functions like this is that you may have your values for PI and for radius available at different moment of the life of your program.

FP the global functions/constants are avoided.\r\n\r\nSo my question is are partial functions pure ?\r\n\r\nIf I have to calculate the area of a circle for example, i have something like this:\r\n\r\n    const calcArea = PI =&gt; radius =&gt; PI * radius * radius\r\n\r\nSo I can partially apply it:\r\n\r\n    const calcAreaCircle = calcArea(Math.PI) //\r\n\r\n    calcAreaCircle(5) =&gt; // 3.13 * 5 * 5 = 78.53981633974483\r\n\r\nSo if I change the PI and run the program again i will get different results:\r\n\r\n    const calcAreaCircle = calcArea(Math.PI+2)\r\n\r\nSo what&#39;s the point to partially apply the function since it becomes some kind of global variable, it&#39;s pure but it is not `DETERMINISTIC` it can be change and if you change it other function will change the results

it many functions will change the output as well.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to avoid global scope and to make the function pure, but without pasing PI to every call.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the function accepts more than 2 parameters it becomes nightmare to support

Both amount to the old standard of 72 pts/in. Though, now we have devices with different pixel ratios. To figure out an exact size would mean you need to determine the current device&#39;s screen size and it&#39;s pixel ratio. Both can be done with WidgetsBinding.instance.window... Then you just do the math from there to convert those measurements to mm. \r\n\r\nHowever, this seems like an odd requirement so you may just be asking how to draw a square of an exact size. You may want to look into the Canvas/Paint API which can be used in conjunction with a CustomPainter. Another option is a Stack with some Position.fromRect or .fromRelativeRect and draw them using that setup.

My question isn&#39;t directly related to this class, but more specifically the way I implement it.\r\n\r\n**DelegateCommand.cs:**\r\n```C#\r\npublic class DelegateCommand : ICommand {\r\n\tprivate readonly Action&lt;object&gt; _executeAction;\r\n\tprivate readonly Func&lt;object, bool&gt; _canExecuteAction;\r\n\r\n\tpublic DelegateCommand(Action&lt;object&gt; executeAction) {\r\n\t\t_executeAction = executeAction;\r\n\t\t_canExecuteAction = CanAlwaysExecute;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic DelegateCommand(Action&lt;object&gt; executeAction, Func&lt;object, bool&gt; canExecuteAction) {\r\n\t\t_executeAction = executeAction;\r\n\t\t_canExecuteAction = canExecuteAction;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tpublic void Execute(object parameter) =&gt; _executeAction(parameter);\r\n\tpublic bool CanExecute(object parameter) =&gt; _canExecuteAction?.Invoke(parameter) ?? true;\r\n\tprivate bool CanAlwaysExecute(object parameter) =&gt; true;\r\n\r\n\tpublic event EventHandler CanExecuteChanged;\r\n\tpublic void InvokeCanExecuteChanged() =&gt; CanExecuteChanged?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, to use this in my view model, I typically do this:\r\n```C#\r\npublic class SomeViewModel : SomeBaseClass {\r\n    private readonly DelegateCommand browseFilesCommand;\r\n    public ICommand BrowseFilesCommand =&gt; browseFilesCommand;\r\n    public void OnBrowseFiles(object param) {\r\n        // Browse things here\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public SomeViewModel() {\r\n        browseFilesCommand = new DelegateCommand(OnBrowseFiles)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, I have noticed that I can avoid the constructor by doing this instead:\r\n```C#\r\npublic class SomeViewModel : SomeBaseClass {\r\n    public ICommand BrowseFilesCommand =&gt; new DelegateCommand(OnBrowseFiles);\r\n    public void OnBrowseFiles(object param) {\r\n        // Browse things here\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public SomeViewModel() {}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSeems like lambda is taking care of business without my help, but I&#39;m wondering if perhaps there are performance implications of creating the binding this way? \r\n\r\nOr if this is bad design, somehow? I mean, it looks cleaner to me, but I&#39;m also assuming other people are binding via a private field for a reason.

Before Xcode 11, when you deleted a storyboard (`Main.storyboard`) from your target, then added a new one (`AnotherStoryboard.storyboard`), you would have to update `Targets &gt; General &gt; Deployment Info &gt; Main Interface` to use your newly added storyboard. In Xcode 11, this is not sufficient and the app will throw an exception\r\n```text\r\n*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception &#39;NSInvalidArgumentException&#39;,\r\nreason: &#39;Could not find a storyboard named &#39;Main&#39; in bundle NSBundle\r\n```\r\nThe problem I found was that in `Info.plist`, there is now a new key titled `UIApplicationSceneManifest` that has a nested `UISceneStoryboardFile` in it that is being updated when you change the Main Interface within the target. However, there is still a `UIMainStoryboardFile` key at the top level of `Info.plist` that is holding the title of the old &quot;Main&quot; storyboard. Long story short, if you delete `UIMainStoryboardFile`, the app will run fine. \r\n\r\nMy question: Is this a bug in Xcode 11 or is there something else I&#39;m missing that would prevent this?

for `key2` it would be 0 documents.\r\n\r\nNote: `attributesMap` is `Map` type. I can&#39;t find use cases related to Map in any example.\r\n\r\n***Update***\r\n\r\nMost people suggested this could be possible duplicate of [this][1] question\r\n\r\nBut when I tried:\r\n\r\n    TestData.find( {  &#39;attributesMap.key1&#39; : { $exists: true } }, ( err: Error, res: ITestData[] ) =&gt; {\r\n                if ( err ) console.log( &#39;err.message &#39; + err.message );\r\n                if ( res ) console.log( &#39;res.length &#39; + res.length );\r\n                if ( res ) {\r\n                    res.forEach( element =&gt; {\r\n                        console.log( &#39;Element: &#39; + JSON.stringify( element ) );\r\n                    } );\r\n                }\r\n            } );\r\n\r\nI am getting the `5` results, but how do I dynamically construct `&#39;attributesMap.key1&#39;`? One possible solution could have been a string like below:\r\n\r\n    const key = &#39;key1&#39;;\r\n    const expr = &quot;attributesMap.&quot; + key;\r\n            TestData.find( {  expr : { $exists: true } }, ( err: Error, res: ITestData[] ) =&gt; {\r\n    ....\r\n    });\r\n\r\nBut the `const expr = &quot;attributesMap.&quot; + key;` value is not passed to find&#39;s condition section the `expr` param is treated as new variable here &amp; results after this change are `0`\r\n\r\n***Solution***\r\n\r\nIn comments section User [sushant-mehta][2] &amp; [Ashh][3] solved the problem of dynamic condition definition.\r\n\r\n1] Approach by sushant-mehta\r\n\r\n    const key = &#39;key1&#39;; let expr = &quot;attributesMap.&quot; + key; let expr2={};\r\n    expr2[expr]={&#39;$exists&#39;: true};\r\n    TestData.find( expr2, ( err: Error, res: ITestData[] ) =&gt; {\r\n    ...\r\n    });\r\n\r\n2] Approach by Assh\r\n\r\n    TestData.find( TestData.find({ [&#39;attributesMap.&#39; + keyName] : { $exists: true } }), ( err: Error, res: ITestData[] ) =&gt; {\r\n        ...\r\n        });\r\n\r\nBoth are working.\r\n\r\n  [1]:

https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/In-hdp-3-0-can-t-create-hive-table-in-spark-failed/td-p/202647\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52761391/table-loaded-through-spark-not-accessible-in-hive\r\n  - setting the properties there proposed in the answer do not solve my issue\r\n- seems also to be a bug: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-20593\r\n\r\nMight be a workaround like the https://github.com/qubole/spark-acid like https://docs.cloudera.com/HDPDocuments/HDP3/HDP-3.1.4/integrating-hive/content/hive_hivewarehouseconnector_for_handling_apache_spark_data.html but I do not like the idea of using more duct tape where I have not seen any large scale performance tests just yet. Also, this means changing all existing spark jobs.\r\n\r\nIn fact https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53323964/cant-save-table-to-hive-metastore-hdp-3-0/53420848 reports issues with large data frames and the warehouse connector.\r\n\r\n\r\n## edit\r\nI just found https://community.cloudera.com/t5/Support-Questions/Spark-hive-warehouse-connector-not-loading-data-when-using/td-p/243613\r\n\r\nAnd:\r\n\r\n&gt; execute() vs executeQuery()\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; ExecuteQuery() will always use the Hiveserver2-interactive/LLAP as it\r\n&gt; uses the fast ARROW protocol. Using it when the jdbc URL point to the\r\n&gt; non-LLAP Hiveserver2 will yield an error.\r\n&gt; \r\n&gt; Execute() uses JDBC and does not have this dependency on LLAP, but has\r\n&gt; a built-in restriction to only return 1.000 records max. But for most\r\n&gt; queries (INSERT INTO ... SELECT, count, sum, average) that is not a\r\n&gt; problem.\r\n\r\nBut doesn&#39;t this kill any high-performance interoperability between hive and spark? Especially if there are not enough LLAP nodes available for large scale ETL.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this is true.

let us consider the type of this function, it must be `Tree a -&gt;  [[a]]`.\r\n\r\nSo what can we do given a node `Node x left right`? We have the path that is just the node itself - this is just `[x]`, as well as the paths that go through this node to the left- and right sub tree. The paths going throu the left and right sub tree are just what we get if we apply our function to `left` and `right` respectively. We now just need to add `x` to the start of each of those paths and we do that by calling `map(x:) paths`.

Why? Because it would end up in a messy project, with a portion of code in a given location, other code somewhere else, other snippets in a third location.. This will make maintenance more complex than it should be, wasting time searching for the code between all different locations.\r\n\r\nFor this subject, I suggest you to read the [PSR-4 specifications and directives][1]\r\n\r\nThat being said, let&#39;s make this example. You want to create a class `OutsideClass`, with namespace `OutsideCode`, in folder `outsideFolder`.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is:\r\n\r\n1. Create in the folder `outsideFilder`, which will be located in the root folder of your project.\r\n2. Create the class `OutsideClass`:\r\n```php\r\n&lt;?php\r\n\r\nnamespace OutsideCode;\r\n\r\nclass OutsideClass\r\n{\r\n    // ...\r\n    // Class properties, constructor and methods\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add the namespace inside the `composer.json`, so the application will be able to translate a namespace into a phisical location:\r\n```json\r\n&quot;autoload&quot;: {\r\n    &quot;psr-4&quot;: {\r\n        ...\r\n        &quot;OutsideCode\\\\&quot;: &quot;outsideFolder/&quot;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n4. Run `composer dump-autoload` to recreate autoload file\r\n5. End. You can now put all the code you want inside this folder, always respecting `PSR-4` directives\r\n6.

employee.name.toLowerCase().indexOf(searchTerm.toLowerCase()) !== -1);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nNow the i am filtering using the `name` property, but i want to filter using `age`,`gender` along with `name`. Using the same input field i want to filter. How can i achieve this?\r\n\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58406104/how-filter-array-with-different-parameters-using-pipes","title":"How filter array with different parameters using pipes"},{"tags":["php","neo4j","code-injection","graphaware"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1522,"user_id":553663,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":72,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Rbxwo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"J.
