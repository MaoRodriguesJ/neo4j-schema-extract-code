Make it an attribute of the class since it will have the same life cycle as the class, and that is the method you used.\r\n\r\n2. Since QPropertyAnimation is a QObject, then one way to extend the life cycle is to pass it a parent, but in this case it is better to destroy it as soon as the animation is finished:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def move(self, direction):\r\n    animation = QPropertyAnimation(self.box, b&#39;geometry&#39;, &lt;b&gt;parent=self&lt;/b&gt;)\r\n    # ...\r\n    animation.start(&lt;b&gt;QPropertyAnimation.DeleteWhenStopped&lt;/b&gt;)\r\n    animation.finished.connect(lambda: self.move(direction))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084165/pyqt5-animation-behaviour-as-class-attribute/58084879#58084879","title":"PyQt5 animation behaviour as class attribute"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":11322887,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GSEh8pYAcSs/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3re8_wpuQ-REigtfRMCjYoXASGW7ow/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Aymane Boukrouh","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11322887/aymane-boukrouh"},"last_editor":{"reputation":112790,"user_id":6622587,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/gAYS0.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"eyllanesc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6622587/eyllanesc"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58084879,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569343616,"creation_date":1569340707,"last_edit_date":1569342372,"question_id":58084165,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084165","body_markdown":"I made a mini-game with python and pyqt5, a moving box that you can move with the arrow keys, but the animation only works when it is defined as a class attribute.\r\n\r\nHere is the code:\r\n\r\n        class Game(QMainWindow):\r\n            # some code\r\n            def move(self, direction):\r\n                animation = QPropertyAnimation(self.box, b&#39;geometry&#39;)\r\n                x, y = self.box.x(), self.box.y()\r\n                if(direction==&#39;right&#39;):\r\n                    x+=10\r\n                # directions left, up and down\r\n                animation.setEndValue(QRect(x, y, 20, 20))\r\n                box.move(x, y)\r\n                animation.setDuration(20)\r\n                animation.start()\r\n                animation.finished.connect(lambda: self.move(direction)\r\n            # capture keypress to move the box\r\n\r\nWhen I replace animation with self.animation, it works fine.\r\nI don&#39;t have a problem using self.animation, but it took me some time to realize that the reason my code wasn&#39;t working is because it&#39;s not an attribute, why does animation only works when it&#39;s an attribute ?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084165/pyqt5-animation-behaviour-as-class-attribute","title":"PyQt5 animation behaviour as class attribute"},{"tags":["python","syntax","jupyter-notebook","highlight"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12114211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c07a89913f775ebb2722a90dfba178ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sauv19","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114211/sauv19"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12114211,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c07a89913f775ebb2722a90dfba178ce?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sauv19","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12114211/sauv19"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569493814,"creation_date":1569340705,"last_edit_date":1569493814,"question_id":58084164,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084164","body_markdown":"I am using inline code within my juptyer-notebook which when viewing in the browser is highlighted in grey, `like this`\r\n\r\nHowever when I press print to convert to PDF, the grey shading is lost and only the different font style remains.

This is for home usage.  The intention is that the user can&#39;t accidentally browse to other sites in that firefox session, that anything downloaded stays safe (encrypted), and that issues with firefox itself won&#39;t break this security setup.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve decided to try firejail around firefox with --private-cache --private=secure-homedir (which is encrypted), and used the uMatrix firefox extension with added rules:\r\n\r\n```\r\n * * doc inherit (blocks all direct 1st party sites)\r\n\r\n  mybank.com * * allow\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works very well.  However, at one point, I accidentally corrupted part of the firefox profile, and the result was that firefox still worked even though uMatrix was broken - allowing the firefox session to browse anywhere.  Not a confidence building event.\r\n\r\nSo, I would instead like to use firejail&#39;s --netfilter=iptablesfile,args... to do what was done by uMatrix, only in a more failsafe way.  I initially configured the iptables file to allow only outbound HTTPS traffic and only for mybank.com, allow DNS and related,established other traffic.  This fails probably because mybank.com&#39;s site does &quot;referer&quot; things with 3rd party sites (some of which apparently aren&#39;t even HTTPS), without which its own web site isn&#39;t very usable.  How do I setup an iptables file that will allow this &quot;referer&quot; traffic only originating from mybank.com?\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also tried using chromium with its hidden --host-rules option:\r\n\r\n```\r\nchromium --host-rules=&quot;MAP * ~NOTFOUND, EXCLUDE mybank.com, EXCLUDE *.mybank.com&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, this works quite well.  But, chromium doesn&#39;t firejail as nicely as firefox.  Most importantly, the --host-rules option isn&#39;t documented and (like other undocumented switches) might go away, and chromium runs just fine when given a command line option it doesn&#39;t understand(!).  That&#39;s even less failsafe than my original firefox/uMatrix setup.\r\n\r\nI&#39;m open to more failsafe alternatives anyone can suggest...","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084152/how-best-to-sandbox-firefox-and-restrict-it-to-one-banking-site-with-iptables","title":"how best to sandbox firefox and restrict it to one banking site with iptables"},{"tags":["oracle-data-integrator"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":845,"user_id":5730590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/229c6a8c0272b21465d1ec1cbaa58d6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"F.Lazarescu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5730590/f-lazarescu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569396063,"post_id":58084150,"comment_id":102578704,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084150/export-all-scenarios-from-execution-repositoryprod-in-odi12c#comment102578704_58084150"},{"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":7189161,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/1163741920372884/picture?type=large","display_name":"Srini","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7189161/srini"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":845,"user_id":5730590,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/229c6a8c0272b21465d1ec1cbaa58d6a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"F.Lazarescu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5730590/f-lazarescu"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569418742,"post_id":58084150,"comment_id":102591263,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084150/export-all-scenarios-from-execution-repositoryprod-in-odi12c#comment102591263_58084150"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1295,"user_id":3548287,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LeVRe.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"JeromeFr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3548287/jeromefr"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569487302,"creation_date":1569487302,"answer_id":58112836,"question_id":58084150,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58112836","body_markdown":"Here are 3 options to achieve an automatic export of all scenarios :\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.

NGXS docs for [action dispatching](https://www.ngxs.io/concepts/store#dispatching-actions), there&#39;s a passage mentioning that getting the state after an add operation could be done using `@Select`.\r\n\r\n    @Component({ ... })\r\n    export class ZooComponent {\r\n      @Select(state =&gt; state.animals) animals$: Observable&lt;any&gt;;\r\n      constructor(private store: Store)

There&#39;s no aforementioned `@Select` (except in an image) and I feel that I missed something. I can look up the decorator in other places but I suspect that I missed something as it pops up with no prior description.\r\n\r\nShould the mentioning of the `@Select` decorator be seen as a side-thing at this point? A bit clumsy amended info, so to speak? Or is it a fundamental point, which I&#39;m missing?\r\n\r\nI also noticed that the dispatching is followed by a pipe but with one argument only. And those two unexpected observation make me uncertain. it seems like the docs are a bit sloppy here but I do fear that they aren&#39;t and that it&#39;s me who misses the point.\r\n\r\nAnd at my current competence level I have no way to determine that.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084147/unexpected-usage-of-select-in-ngxs-docs","title":"Unexpected usage of @Select in NGXS docs"},{"tags":["selection","vendor"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12108481,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/7a412b6f21981749ce51586741c92ff4?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sunil","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12108481/sunil"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":7,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569340608,"creation_date":1569340608,"question_id":58084144,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084144","body_markdown":"I am new to postgres and in the process of assessing its implementation at our company.

The most straightforward way would be to configure each dialog node to store the value of `output.generic.text` in a context variable, and then you could use that variable as needed. But if you have many dialog nodes, that could be a tedious task and pose some maintenance headaches.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to try to tackle this at the application layer, which would have some advantages. If your application could catch requests to repeat, then you could handle those (caching the previous turn&#39;s dialog response and just repeating it upon request). The advantage to this approach is that by not handling a repetition request within Watson Assistant itself, you won&#39;t be interfering with the current session state -- this could be especially useful if the user was in the middle of providing prompted information for a slot, for instance. You wouldn&#39;t need to manage this as a digression or anything like that.\r\n\r\nBut if you aren&#39;t able to handle this at the application layer, there aren&#39;t any really great options. I think it would be great if IBM considered adding a global response repeat function at the Assistant level (would be especially great for Voice Agent / Voice Gateway applications).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084131/how-can-i-make-watson-assistant-repeat-the-last-response/58100123#58100123","title":"How can I make Watson assistant repeat the last response?"}],"owner":{"reputation":743,"user_id":3049394,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0145b4df8a9b3238b784bbcf300cd54?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TVK","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3049394/tvk"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569419860,"creation_date":1569340563,"question_id":58084131,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084131","body_markdown":"I would like to have my watson assistant repeat the response that was given before.\r\n\r\nI have an Intent that matches e.g. &quot;Can you please repeat that?&quot;.\r\nThen if that Intent is matched, the answer should be the same that was given before.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to archieve that? \r\nHow can I access the answer from before in the [expression language][1]?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-methods#dialog-methods-evaluation-syntax","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084131/how-can-i-make-watson-assistant-repeat-the-last-response","title":"How can I make Watson assistant repeat the last response?"},{"tags":["ssis","msbuild","azure-devops","azure-pipelines","azure-devops-self-hosted-agent"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":48788,"user_id":181965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87b30982fd95ba3e646522b1ced1f8cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"billinkc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181965/billinkc"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569340995,"post_id":58084130,"comment_id":102562403,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084130/ssis-project-fails-to-build-on-self-hosted-agent#comment102562403_58084130"},{"owner":{"reputation":1737,"user_id":1854345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeQ4p.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TrevorBrooks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1854345/trevorbrooks"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":48788,"user_id":181965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87b30982fd95ba3e646522b1ced1f8cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"billinkc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181965/billinkc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569341273,"post_id":58084130,"comment_id":102562558,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084130/ssis-project-fails-to-build-on-self-hosted-agent#comment102562558_58084130"},{"owner":{"reputation":1737,"user_id":1854345,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FeQ4p.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"TrevorBrooks","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1854345/trevorbrooks"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":48788,"user_id":181965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87b30982fd95ba3e646522b1ced1f8cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"billinkc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181965/billinkc"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569350760,"post_id":58084130,"comment_id":102566604,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084130/ssis-project-fails-to-build-on-self-hosted-agent#comment102566604_58084130"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":48788,"user_id":181965,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":80,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/87b30982fd95ba3e646522b1ced1f8cb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"billinkc","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/181965/billinkc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"is_accepted":true,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569351428,"creation_date":1569351428,"answer_id":58086614,"question_id":58084130,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58086614","body_markdown":"The other generic trouble shooting advice is to remove the space in your &quot;My Project&quot; folder.

overview of how to do it: \r\n\r\n 1. Register a [mousemove](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/mousemove_event)-handler and track your mouse-screen location (see link) \r\n 2. translate mouse screenlocation, to mouse location relative to rectangle: \r\n - `e.target` in mousemove event gives you the rectangle (or some descendent which allows you to get to the rectangle. \r\n - given the target element get it&#39;s position (top + left using `getBoundingClientRect`) as well as width and height. These should be easy to lookup\r\n 3. Notice that the mouse at the center of the rectangle doesn&#39;t rotate the rectangle. Only when moving to the edges, the rotation starts to get going. This rotational rate-of-change seems to be linear. So: \r\n  - determine the max rotation that seems nice to have in degrees. Simply test with different numbers in the chrome dev tools or similar: `transform: rotateY(0.01deg) rotateX(0.01deg);` Say you want to have a max rotation of 25 degrees. \r\n  - say the rectangle is 100px in width. It&#39;s clear to see that each pixel movement from the center to the edge (50 px in total) adds 0.5 degree to the rotation due to the linear rate of change: 25 deg / 50px. So for example moving 20px to the left of the center translates to `rotateY(10deg);`. Moving 20px to the right results in the mirror rotation (`rotateY(-10deg);`). NOTE: the positive and negative may need to be flipped.\r\n  - similarly, moving along the Y-axis changes the `rotateX-property`. \r\n- Once calculated, set the css-property and you&#39;re done\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084123/css-transform-effect-in-mongodb-site/58084506#58084506","title":"Css Transform Effect in MongoDB site"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10859440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_M6ALB8edY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHzQ/nPjLNXwphM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amarender Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10859440/amarender-reddy"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569353518,"post_id":58085145,"comment_id":102567725,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084123/css-transform-effect-in-mongodb-site/58085145#comment102567725_58085145"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":72,"user_id":2480539,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54d9b74c5de4feb771b12683d6d1676f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2480539/eee"},"last_editor":{"reputation":72,"user_id":2480539,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/54d9b74c5de4feb771b12683d6d1676f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"eee","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2480539/eee"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569466156,"last_edit_date":1569466156,"creation_date":1569344849,"answer_id":58085145,"question_id":58084123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58085145","body_markdown":"I believe this must be done with Javascript. The general idea is when the mouse enter/move on the element, you compare it&#39;s coordinate with the position and width/height of the element to decide the rotation values. When the mouse leave the element, you reset the values of the rotation back to normal.\r\n\r\nYou can get the coordinate of the mouse from event by using:\r\n```\r\nconst mouseX = event.clientX;     // Get the horizontal coordinate\r\nconst mouseY = event.clientY;     // Get the vertical coordinate\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the position of the element:\r\n```\r\nconst eleLoc = event.target.getBoundingClientRect();\r\n```\r\nFrom there you calculate the center and the width/height of the element:\r\n```\r\nconst centerX = (eleLoc.right + eleLoc.left) / 2\r\nconst centerY = (eleLoc.bottom + eleLoc.top) / 2\r\nconst halfWidth = (eleLoc.right - eleLoc.left) / 2\r\nconst halfHeight = (eleLoc.bottom- eleLoc.top) / 2\r\n```\r\nThen you calculate the distance between the mouse and the center in percent. In the center, the distance is 0, at the border, it&#39;s 1 (or -1).\r\n```\r\nconst percentX = (mouseX - centerX) / halfWidth\r\nconst percentY = (mouseY - centerY) / halfHeight\r\n```\r\nNow you only need to rotate X/Y based on the distance percent:\r\n```\r\nconst degX = percentX * maxDegX\r\nconst defY = percentY * maxDegY\r\nevent.target.style.transform = `perspective(${yourPerspective}px) rotateX(${degX}deg) rotateY(${degY}deg)`\r\n```\r\nRemember to reset the transform when your mouse move out.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\nThere are some libraries for this, ie: [tilt.js](https://github.com/gijsroge/tilt.js)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084123/css-transform-effect-in-mongodb-site/58085145#58085145","title":"Css Transform Effect in MongoDB site"}],"owner":{"reputation":36,"user_id":10859440,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-D_M6ALB8edY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAHzQ/nPjLNXwphM8/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Amarender Reddy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10859440/amarender-reddy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1974,"user_id":3169688,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e6623f38d0544f881d62739b2008cd0c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"jcruz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3169688/jcruz"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":55,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58084506,"answer_count":2,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1569466156,"creation_date":1569340541,"last_edit_date":1569358265,"question_id":58084123,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084123","body_markdown":"I am new to css and learning different type of css styles.

&quot; + err);\r\n\t        speech_recognizer.close();\r\n\t        speech_recognizer = undefined;\r\n     });\r\nI get an error saying: `window is not defined`\r\n\r\nnpm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/microsoft-cognitiveservices-speech-sdk","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084122/microsoft-speech-recognition-nodejs","title":"microsoft speech recognition + nodejs"},{"tags":["regex","notepad++","emeditor"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":2067607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33784a124ecf1f3aff66bb778790c73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greektranslator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067607/greektranslator"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569395772,"post_id":58084310,"comment_id":102578556,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084119/match-strings-between-delimiting-characters/58084310#comment102578556_58084310"},{"owner":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":108,"user_id":2067607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33784a124ecf1f3aff66bb778790c73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greektranslator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067607/greektranslator"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569396260,"post_id":58084310,"comment_id":102578800,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084119/match-strings-between-delimiting-characters/58084310#comment102578800_58084310"},{"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":2067607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33784a124ecf1f3aff66bb778790c73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greektranslator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067607/greektranslator"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569396388,"post_id":58084310,"comment_id":102578852,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084119/match-strings-between-delimiting-characters/58084310#comment102578852_58084310"},{"owner":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":108,"user_id":2067607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33784a124ecf1f3aff66bb778790c73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greektranslator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067607/greektranslator"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569396518,"post_id":58084310,"comment_id":102578913,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084119/match-strings-between-delimiting-characters/58084310#comment102578913_58084310"},{"owner":{"reputation":108,"user_id":2067607,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":40,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/33784a124ecf1f3aff66bb778790c73a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"greektranslator","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2067607/greektranslator"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569396986,"post_id":58084310,"comment_id":102579155,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084119/match-strings-between-delimiting-characters/58084310#comment102579155_58084310"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"last_editor":{"reputation":43558,"user_id":5424988,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d0b4f91c20dcd87cbd58dd351455198c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"The fourth bird","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5424988/the-fourth-bird"},"comment_count":5,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"is_accepted":true,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569396582,"last_edit_date":1569396582,"creation_date":1569341262,"answer_id":58084310,"question_id":58084119,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58084310","body_markdown":"One option could be making use of the `\\G` anchor and 2 capturing groups:\r\n\r\n    (?:‘|\\G(?!^))([^,\\r\\n’]+)(?=[^\\r\\n’]*’)(?:(,\\h*)|’)\r\n\r\nIn parts\r\n\r\n- `(?:` Non capturing group\r\n -

To train the generator I need to feed it input_image and condition_image, and for the discriminator I feed the target_image and condition_image. My problem is how the Estimator finds the proper input to the model for the dictionary that I create in input_fn. Here is the psudo-code for my input function code:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef input_fn(mode, params):\r\n    is_train = mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN\r\n\r\n    # Yields a triplet of input_image, condition_image, target_image\r\n    data_gen = training_generator if is_train else test_generator \r\n    \r\n    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_generator(data_gen,\r\n        ({&#39;input&#39;: tf.float32, &#39;condition&#39;: tf.float32, &#39;target&#39;: tf.float32}),\r\n        output_shapes=({&#39;input&#39;: tf.TensorShape(shape), &#39;condition&#39;: tf.TensorShape(shape),\r\n                        &#39;target&#39;: tf.TensorShape(shape)}))\r\n    if is_train:\r\n        dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size=int(config[&quot;shuffle_buffer_ratio&quot;] * config[&quot;batch_size&quot;]))\r\n\r\n    dataset = dataset.prefetch(config[&quot;max_buffer&quot;])\r\n    dataset = dataset.batch(config[&quot;batch_size&quot;])\r\n    # return dataset\r\n\r\n    iterator = dataset.make_one_shot_iterator()\r\n    next_item = iterator.get_next()\r\n    return next_item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first issue is to define the generator to use the two inputs from the dictionary:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef generator_fn(input_dict, mode=&#39;TRAIN&#39;, scope=&#39;Generator&#39;):\r\n    input = input_dict[‘input’]\r\n    condition = input_dict[‘condition’]\r\n    with tf.compat.v1.variable_scope(scope, reuse=tf.compat.v1.AUTO_REUSE):\r\n        x = generator_network(x)\r\n    return x\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the second problem is how to switch the sequence between fake and valid images for the discriminator (using the joint_train parameter probably):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef discriminator_fn(image, input_dict, scope=&#39;Discriminator&#39;):\r\n    x = discriminator_network(x)\r\nreturn x\r\n```\r\n\r\nI defined the TPUGANEstimator according to the documentations, but I didn’t find a good tutorial/example on how to generate the correct sequence. \r\n\r\n```\r\ngan_estimator = tfgan.estimator.TPUGANEstimator(\r\n    generator_fn=generator_fn,\r\n    discriminator_fn=discriminator_fn,\r\n    generator_loss_fn=tfgan.losses.minimax_generator_loss,\r\n    discriminator_loss_fn=tfgan.losses.minimax_discriminator_loss,\r\n    generator_optimizer=tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.1, 0.5),\r\n    discriminator_optimizer=tf.compat.v1.train.AdamOptimizer(0.1, 0.5),\r\n    joint_train=False,\r\n    gan_train_steps=tfgan_tuples.GANTrainSteps(1, 1),\r\n    model_dir=config[&#39;model_dir&#39;],\r\n    params=params,\r\n    use_tpu=False,\r\n    train_batch_size=2,\r\n    eval_batch_size=2,\r\n    config=t_config)\r\n\r\nwhile cur_step &lt; number_of_steps:\r\n    print(&quot;Running gan estimator: {}&quot;.format(cur_step))\r\n    gan_estimator.train(train_input_fn, steps=cur_step)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI highly appreciate your kind help in advance.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084102/preparing-data-for-gan-training-on-tpu","title":"Preparing data for GAN training on TPU"},{"tags":["php","wordpress","woocommerce"],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7189805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210613279268628/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jose Emanuel Rojas Rivas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7189805/jose-emanuel-rojas-rivas"},"last_editor":{"reputation":6,"user_id":7189805,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/10210613279268628/picture?type=large","display_name":"Jose Emanuel Rojas Rivas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7189805/jose-emanuel-rojas-rivas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":0,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569340885,"creation_date":1569340432,"last_edit_date":1569340885,"question_id":58084099,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084099","body_markdown":"Good afternoon friends, I will be brief; I am trying to customize the display of discounted product prices as shown in the following image: \r\n[Example][1]\r\n\r\nNow, I have already obtained several codes and I am modifying them to achieve that result.

Unicode has also an parallel ISO standard (ISO 10646). And we had other ISO standards for texts.\r\n\r\nYou are looking instead the ISO 8859, which is made by various parts: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO/IEC_8859\r\n\r\nThis is a 8-bit character encoder, so you have a very limited character set (256 minus 32 characters). For this reason there are many different parts, and one choose what better fit on own country/language. You may choose Latin-1 for West European languages, or better Latin-9 (part 15) which includes the &quot;new&quot; character: Euro symbol (currency).\r\n\r\nIn your example, you have the language specific codes `EB`. In part 13 (Latin-7) it is `ė` (baltic), but in part 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 14, 15, and part 16 it is `&#235;`. As you see, this is variant is used in many more languages, so it is available in most of the ISO 8859 parts. In the page I linked above, you see also the table with every variant per code/value.\r\n\r\nThe main problem now it is to detect the original encoding. This could be very problematic for people who cannot asses which the language, so the spelling, of a text.

When I browse the application, my webapi correctly attempts to serve up the index.html file, but it fails to load any of the required assets\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the default `index.html` generated by `ng new TestAngularApp` sets the `base` as `/`:\r\n\r\n&lt;pre&gt;\r\n&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;\r\n  &amp;lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&amp;gt;\r\n  &amp;lt;title&amp;gt;TestAngularApp&amp;lt;/title&amp;gt;\r\n  &lt;b&gt;&amp;lt;base href=&quot;/&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/b&gt;\r\n  ....\r\n&amp;lt;/head&gt;\r\n&lt;/pre&gt;\r\n\r\nThis will make all your assets path relative to `/`.

ASP.NET Core project, was generating using the `dotnet new webapi -o TestAPI`\r\n2. Angular project, generated using the Angular CLI `ng new TestAngularApp`\r\n\r\nSince the web api project is the back-end for the angular project, I want it to serve my angular app. Based on my research the way ASP.NET Core serves static files is you have to create a `wwwroot` folder at the root directory of your web api project, and put all of contents produced by the `ng build --prod` command inside that `wwwroot` folder. \r\n\r\nThe next step is where I am un-sure what I must configure next. Thus far in my `Startup.cs` file in the `Configure` method I have added\r\n\r\n`app.UseDefaultFiles();\r\n app.UseStaticFiles();`\r\n\r\nNow this works as expected when I run the webapi project in debug mode straight from Visual Studio. The problem arises when I want to publish the webapi and locally deploy it to IIS.\r\n\r\nI run `dotnet publish -c Release` command and all of the files get generated in the `.../publish` directory including the `wwwroot` directory as expected.\r\n\r\nIn IIS, I then create an application under the `Default Web Site` and point it the `.../publish` directory.\r\n\r\n[![IIS Aplication][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point I have enabled `Failed Request Tracing` on the Site level.\r\n\r\nWhen I browse the application, my webapi correctly attempts to serve up the `index.html` file, but it fails to load any of the required assets. \r\n\r\nI have tried adding re-write url rules to both the `ThePLeague` application AND the &#39;wwwroot&#39; directory that is located inside of that application but this does not work. I have tested to make sure my url re-write module does in fact work and it does.\r\n\r\nMy question is, **Does my webapi require any additional configuration to successfully serve up Angular files?**\r\n\r\nDo I need to use the `SpaFallbackException`, `UseSpa`, `UseSpaStaticFiles` or any of the `Spa` prefix extension methods to get this to work, or should the two methods I already have be enough?\r\n\r\nThank you for any insight you can provide.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE**\r\n\r\nAfter adjusting the base URL as mentioned in the answer, my files were successfully served. My base url was adjusted to `&lt;base href=&quot;/ThePLeague/&quot;&gt;`. The problem now however is that when I refresh the page. I receive a 404 error. I have the URL re-write rules sitting in the same directory as the ASP.NET Core webapi and NOT inside the `wwwroot` folder where all of my static files are. This is because when I enable `Failed Request Tracing Rules` in `IIS`, there are no logs generated when having the rules created inside the `wwwroot` folder.\r\n\r\nURL re-write rules:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\n    `&lt;system.webServer&gt;\r\n            &lt;rewrite&gt;\r\n                &lt;rules&gt;\r\n                    &lt;rule name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;\r\n                        &lt;match url=&quot;.*&quot;

My problem was specifying AnyCPU instead of x86. But... Now when I switch to a self-contained deployment I get the same error as before. So It must be something to do with how I&#39;m publishing the .net core. \r\n\r\nThis is my publish profile currently. When i switch to framework dependent the installer runs fine and starts the service.\r\n[![This is my publish profile currently.

When for example I click on the &quot;upload&quot; button to upload my photo in profile of moodle, nothing happens.\r\nI have included the following in the manifest file:\r\n\r\n   &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.INTERNET&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- This code is for DownloadActivity: --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE&quot; /&gt;\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.CAMERA&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO&quot;/&gt;\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS&quot; /&gt;\r\n    \r\n\r\n    &lt;!--\r\n    Allows Glide to monitor connectivity status and restart failed requests if users go from a disconnected to a connected network state.\r\n    --&gt;\r\n    &lt;uses-permission android:name=&quot;android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE&quot; /&gt;\r\n\r\nAnd the following lines have been added to the MainActivity:\r\n\r\n    &lt;if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &gt;= Build.VERSION_CODES.M) {\r\n            int hasCameraPermission = \r\n    checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.CAMERA);\r\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;has camera permission: &quot; + hasCameraPermission);\r\n            int hasRecordPermission = \r\n    checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO);\r\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;has record permission: &quot; + hasRecordPermission);\r\n            int hasAudioPermission = \r\n    checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS);\r\n            Log.d(TAG, &quot;has audio permission: &quot; + hasAudioPermission);\r\n            List&lt;String&gt; permissions = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();\r\n            if (hasCameraPermission != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n                permissions.add(Manifest.permission.CAMERA);\r\n            }\r\n            if (hasRecordPermission != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n                permissions.add(Manifest.permission.RECORD_AUDIO);\r\n            }\r\n            if (hasAudioPermission != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {\r\n                permissions.add(Manifest.permission.MODIFY_AUDIO_SETTINGS);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (!permissions.isEmpty()) {\r\n                requestPermissions(permissions.toArray(new \r\n    String[permissions.size()]),111);\r\n\r\n            }\r\n        } \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following were also added to the webView activity:\r\n\r\n            wvs.setWebChromeClient(new WebChromeClient() {\r\n                @TargetApi(Build.VERSION_CODES.LOLLIPOP)\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onPermissionRequest(final PermissionRequest request) {\r\n                    SiteActivity.this.runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {\r\n                        @Override\r\n                        public void run() {\r\n                            request.grant(request.getResources());\r\n                        }\r\n                    });\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                @Override\r\n                public void onPermissionRequestCanceled(PermissionRequest \r\n    request) {\r\n    // The following line was underlined red so I commented it out!                   \r\n    //Log.d(TAG, &quot;onPermissionRequestCanceled&quot;);\r\n                }\r\n            });  \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter adding the above lines, when I run the app, I am asked to give permission but then a white page opens in webview and nothing happens!\r\n\r\nAlso, recording audio and video does not function inside the moodle site running in a webview! This may also help to find out the issue!\r\n\r\nWould you please help me to eliminate the problem.\r\nI highly appreciate your help.\r\nFaramarz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084081/moodle-upload-button-of-my-site-doesnt-function-inside-android-webview","title":"Moodle &quot;upload&quot; button of my site doesn&#39;t function inside android webview"},{"tags":["android"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":61,"user_id":7481515,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTlUx.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"unaisulhadi","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7481515/unaisulhadi"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":false,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1569394676,"creation_date":1569394676,"answer_id":58092730,"question_id":58084079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58092730","body_markdown":"You have to use BroadcastReciever class for detecting Network changes.\r\n\r\nYou may get a solution here:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/1783117/network-listener-android\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084079/refresh-activity-if-internet-connection-established-in-between-task-is-running/58092730#58092730","title":"Refresh activity if Internet connection established in between task is running"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12047490,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mAJvnoyponKsOW9ym6lxqtb3ponIbT9iwyFWjv9XQ=k-s128","display_name":"shridhar choudhari","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12047490/shridhar-choudhari"},"last_editor":{"reputation":34008,"user_id":2649012,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/i4SzF.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Fant&#244;mas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2649012/fant%c3%b4mas"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569394676,"creation_date":1569340359,"last_edit_date":1569343783,"question_id":58084079,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084079","body_markdown":"I am getting data from the server using retrofit and showing it on the\r\nfragmented screen.

If not, how can I narrow it down to just the definition for &quot;medicationAtDx&quot;?  I can traverse the whole dictionary to get what I want if I have to, but I&#39;d rather have it return just the reference I need.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n\r\nETA: per Relequestual&#39;s comment below, I took a couple of passes with resolve_fragment as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nref_doc = meddx_url.split(&quot;#&quot;)[0]\r\nref_frag = meddx_url.split(&quot;#&quot;)[1]\r\ntestref.resolve_fragment(ref_doc, ref_frag)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives me &quot;TypeError: string indices must be integers&quot; and &quot;RefResolutionError: Unresolvable JSON pointer&quot;.  I tried tweaking the parameters in different ways (adding the &quot;#&quot; back into the fragment, removing the leading slash, etc.) and got the same results.  Relequestual&#39;s explanation of a fragment was very helpful, but apparently I&#39;m still not understanding the exact parameters that resolve_fragment is expecting.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084077/how-do-i-resolve-a-single-reference-with-python-jsonschema-refresolver","title":"How do I resolve a single reference with Python jsonschema RefResolver"},{"tags":["python"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1569340589,"post_id":58084072,"comment_id":102562183,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084072/python-module-not-found-but-exists-in-folder#comment102562183_58084072"},{"owner":{"reputation":912,"user_id":2410547,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":37,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/XTg3p.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"RonaldoLanhellas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2410547/ronaldolanhellas"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":13818,"user_id":494134,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":66,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ca0f8158fe405abdbf211622853bb3e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"John Gordon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/494134/john-gordon"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569340751,"post_id":58084072,"comment_id":102562281,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084072/python-module-not-found-but-exists-in-folder#comment102562281_58084072"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"user_type":"does_not_exist","display_name":"user6851498"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569340700,"creation_date":1569340700,"answer_id":58084162,"question_id":58084072,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58084162","body_markdown":"Check the python version you are calling.

The error message that is thrown is literally &quot;unable to decrypt data&quot; which is not helpful.\r\n\r\nServer-side code for generating keypairs:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// Generate public/private keypairs\r\nexports.generateKeyPair = (password) =&gt; {\r\n\treturn new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tcrypto.generateKeyPair(&#39;rsa&#39;, {\r\n\t\t\tmodulusLength: 4096,\r\n\t\t\tpublicKeyEncoding: {\r\n\t\t\t\ttype: &#39;spki&#39;,\r\n\t\t\t\tformat: &#39;pem&#39;\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tprivateKeyEncoding: {\r\n\t\t\t\ttype: &#39;pkcs8&#39;,\r\n\t\t\t\tformat: &#39;pem&#39;,\r\n\t\t\t\tcipher: &#39;aes-256-cbc&#39;,\r\n\t\t\t\tpassphrase: password\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t}, (err, publicKey, privateKey) =&gt; {\r\n\t\t\t\tif (err) reject(err);\r\n\t\t\t\telse resolve([publicKey, privateKey]);\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t})\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient-side code for decrypting and encrypting (Node crypto library is sent to client using Browserify):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar crypto = require(&#39;crypto&#39;);\r\n\r\nwindow.encrypt = function (data, publicKey) {\r\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.from(data);\r\n\tlet encrypted = crypto.publicEncrypt(publicKey, buffer);\r\n\treturn encrypted.toString(&#39;base64&#39;);\r\n}\r\n\r\nwindow.decrypt = function(data, privateKey, password) {\r\n\tlet buffer = Buffer.from(data, &#39;base64&#39;);\r\n\tlet decrypted = crypto.privateDecrypt({\r\n\t\tkey: privateKey,\r\n\t\tpassphrase: password\r\n\t}, buffer);\r\n\treturn decrypted.toString(&#39;utf8&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nClient-side code that interacts with the UI:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar sendMsg = function() {\r\n\tlet token = $(&#39;#token&#39;).val();\r\n\tlet toUser = $(&#39;#toUser&#39;).val();\r\n\tlet message = btoa($(&#39;#sendMessage&#39;).val());\r\n\tfetch(`/keypairs/public/${toUser}?token=${token}`)\r\n\t.then((res) =&gt; res.json())\r\n\t.then((json) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tif (json.code != 200) throw &#39;Error&#39;;\r\n\t\telse return json.data.pubKey;\r\n\t})\r\n\t.then((pubKey) =&gt; encrypt(message, pubKey))\r\n\t.then((encrypted) =&gt; $(&#39;#send-result&#39;).html(encrypted))\r\n\t.catch((err) =&gt; alert(err));\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar decryptMsg = function() {\r\n\tlet token = $(&#39;#token&#39;).val();\r\n\tlet encrypted = $(&#39;#decrypt-text&#39;).val();\r\n\tlet password = $(&#39;#decrypt-pass&#39;).val();\r\n\r\n\tfetch(`/keypairs/private?token=${token}`)\r\n\t.then((res) =&gt; res.json())\r\n\t.then((json) =&gt; {\r\n\t\tif (json.code != 200) throw &#39;Error&#39;;\r\n\t\telse return json.data.privKey;\r\n\t})\r\n\t.then((privKey) =&gt; decrypt(encrypted, privKey, password))\r\n\t.then((decrypted) =&gt; $(&#39;#decrypt-result&#39;).html(decrypted))\r\n\t.catch((err) =&gt; (console.error(err), alert(err))); // &lt;-- this line gives useless info\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nI paste the encrypted data into a field `#&#39;decrypt-text`. I also pass the User B password. The token is retrieved during the sign-in process to associate the user with a key in the database. As I mentioned, the only error I get is &quot;Unable to decrypt data&quot;. Any ideas? Perhaps I need to generate keys with `pkcs1` type?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084051/rsa-private-key-unable-to-decrypt-data","title":"RSA private key unable to decrypt

Playlist&#39;s relationship (song) successfully, for an instance, playlist1(song1) -&gt; after added, playlist(song1, song2). As below code showed, to use addToSong(song) method, which is auto-generated by CoreData and use to add object into relationship.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n        // fetch selected playlist first\r\n        let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest&lt;Playlist&gt;(entityName: &quot;Playlist&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        let currentCell = self.tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)\r\n        let cellText = currentCell?.textLabel?.text\r\n        print(&quot;cell text&quot;, cellText ?? &quot;No Playlist Name&quot;)\r\n        \r\n        let predicate = NSPredicate(format: &quot;name = &#39;\\(cellText!)&#39; &quot;, &quot;&quot;)\r\n        fetchRequest.predicate = predicate\r\n        \r\n        let song = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObject(forEntityName: &quot;Song&quot;, into: context) as!

In my case, what I want to do is that, e.g. before, playlist1(song1, song2, song3) and after removeFromSong(xx), playlist1(song2, song3). I do search the network, but not find how to locate the specific object to remove from relationship, any help could be appreciated!\r\n\r\n/ / / in below code, I create a new Song object and assign it two attributes as songName and artistName, then use removeFromSong() to remove this new created song from playlist&#39;s relationship, but I don&#39;t know if this way could locate the correct song saved in relationship.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunc deleteSong(indexPath: IndexPath) {\r\n\r\n        // remove record from Playlist entity of DB\r\n        let fetchRequest = NSFetchRequest&lt;Playlist&gt;(entityName: &quot;Playlist&quot;)\r\n\r\n        let currentCell = self.tableView.cellForRow(at: indexPath)\r\n        // let cellText = currentCell?.textLabel?.text\r\n        let cellText = navigationItem.title\r\n\r\n        let predicate = NSPredicate(format: &quot;name = &#39;\\(cellText!)&#39; &quot;, &quot;&quot;)\r\n        fetchRequest.predicate = predicate\r\n        \r\n        let song = NSEntityDescription.insertNewObject(forEntityName: &quot;Song&quot;, into: context) as!

Then remove that song ```removeFromSong(song)```from playlist.\r\n\r\n3. remove ```reloadData```, which is not needed to appear after ```deleteRow```.\r\n\r\n**Question:** Now I could remove the selected from the tableView via swiping to delete, but if I force close the App or navi to other view and back, the delete item is backed. So the deletion is not effected in Core Data model.

To my current knowledge the mechanism behind is that Numpy is being [extended][3] by modules in C which are exposed to OpenMP through\r\n\r\n`extra_args = [&#39;-fopenmp&#39;]`\r\n\r\nI have developed and tested a script to run through `mpirun -np 4 python &lt;myscript.py&gt;` and it works. Since models are getting bigger my interest is to shift some processing to a GPU in the physical form of a NVIDIA GPU through OpenMP. I read about this being called Offloading. I have installed a Quadro K2000 with \r\n\r\n    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n    | NVIDIA-SMI 418.56       Driver Version: 418.56       CUDA Version: 10.1     |\r\n    |-------------------------------+----------------------+----------------------+\r\n    | GPU  Name        Persistence-M| Bus-Id        Disp.A | Volatile Uncorr.

I then \r\n\r\n2. altered the compiler flags to \r\n\r\n`extra_args = [&#39;-fopenmp&#39;, &#39;-fstack-protector&#39;]`\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n4. compiled the installation through `python setup.py build`. This returns the following message for the targeted module `cg_ext.c` without any further error:\r\n\r\n&gt; x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc -pthread -shared -Wl,-O1 -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -fno-strict-aliasing -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/python2.7-rzpqx3/python2.7-2.7.16=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wl,-Bsymbolic-functions -Wl,-z,relro -Wdate-time -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -g -fdebug-prefix-map=/build/python2.7-rzpqx3/python2.7-2.7.16=. -fstack-protector-strong -Wformat -Werror=format-security build/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7/anuga/utilities/cg_ext.o -Lbuild/temp.linux-x86_64-2.7 -o build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/anuga/utilities/cg_ext.so -fopenmp -fstack-protector\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n\r\n5. I check on the compiled library with `ldd` I get\r\n\r\n&gt; build/lib.linux-x86_64-2.7/anuga/utilities/cg_ext.so\r\n\tlinux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fff7a9fa000)\r\n\tlibgomp.so.1 =&gt; /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1 (0x00007f0650502000)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\tlibc.so.6 =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0650317000)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\tlibdl.so.2 =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f0650311000)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\tlibpthread.so.0 =&gt; /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f06502f0000)&lt;br&gt;\r\n\t/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0650606000)\r\n\r\nso I presume that everything has been setup correctly. I now move on to \r\n\r\n6. altering the pragma comments on one routine as follows:\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n    void cg_daxpy(int N, double a, double *x, double *y)\r\n    {\r\n      int i;\r\n      #pragma omp parallel for private(i)\r\n      for(i=0;i&lt;N;i++)\r\n      {\r\n        y[i]=y[i]+a*x[i];\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n\r\n    void cg_daxpy(int N, double a, double *x, double *y)\r\n    {\r\n      int i;\r\n      #pragma omp target device(0)\r\n      {\r\n      #pragma omp parallel for\r\n      for(i=0;i&lt;N;i++)\r\n      {\r\n        y[i]=y[i]+a*x[i];\r\n      }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI then recompile an install and run my script as follows in the hope of getting profiling information:\r\n\r\n    nvprof --print-gpu-trace --profile-child-processes --profile-from-start off -fo %p.nvprof python -m cProfile runDamBreak.py\r\n\r\nThis returns the message\r\n\r\n    ==19444== Profiling application: orted --hnp --set-sid --report-uri 14 --singleton-died-pipe 15 -mca state_novm_select 1 -mca ess hnp -mca pmix ^s1,s2,cray,isolated\r\n    ==19444== Profiling result:\r\n    No kernels were profiled.\r\n\r\nSo in conclusion I understand that the pragmas are understood by the compiler, but no segments are sent to the GPU. Any hints on how to debug further are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/anuga_core/\r\n  [2]:

But I&#39;m experiencing some weird problems and I&#39;m stucked.\r\n\r\nI have created a very simple [jsfiddle][1], erasing everything except the minimum code to reproduce the problem:\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: js hide: false console: true babel: false --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-js --&gt;\r\n\r\n    $(&#39;#ActnBtn&#39;).click(function() {\r\n      document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;).style.display = &quot;block&quot;;\r\n      console.log(&quot;loader should be showed&quot;);\r\n\r\n      //Intensive code simulation, probably you should adjust the &quot;times&quot; value to the power of your device\r\n      var times = 5000000000;\r\n      for (let i = 0; i &lt; times; i++) {\r\n        var j = (i ^ 2 + 1) / (i - 1) ^ 2;\r\n      }\r\n      console.log(&quot;finished&quot;)\r\n\r\n      setTimeout(function() {\r\n        document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot;;\r\n      }, 1000); \r\n      // 1sec timeout to be able to see the loader\r\n      // document.getElementById(&quot;loading&quot;).style.display = &quot;none&quot; \r\n      // Without timeout loader isn&#39;t showed because &quot;show&quot; and &quot;hide&quot; happens at the same time\r\n    });\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-css --&gt;\r\n\r\n    #loading {\r\n      display: none;\r\n      position: fixed;\r\n      left: 0px;\r\n      top: 0px;\r\n      width: 100%;\r\n      height: 100%;\r\n      z-index: 9999;\r\n      background: url(https://media.giphy.com/media/lrnlLO9o53qH44g7kC/giphy.gif) center no-repeat #fff;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-html --&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;script src=&quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\r\n    &lt;div id=loading&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;button id=&quot;ActnBtn&quot; type=&quot;button&quot;&gt;Do some intesive work&lt;/button&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nLong history short, the loader is showing after the &quot;intesive code&quot;. For me this makes absolutely no sense and I don&#39;t know how to continue now. Any help is appreciated. Thank you so much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nH&#233;ctor\r\n\r\nPD: console shows messages like: [Violation] &#39;click&#39; handler took 4370ms\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://jsfiddle.net/EMCCi/7aeo0859/\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084047/js-weird-behaviour-of-style-display-with-loader-before-intensive-code-fragment","title":"JS weird behaviour of style.display with loader before intensive code fragment"},{"tags":["vb.net","combobox"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":5754,"user_id":8367626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlgmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8367626/mary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569373255,"post_id":58084046,"comment_id":102572744,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084046/vb-net-wpf-application-combobox-not-waiting-for-user-to-choose#comment102572744_58084046"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8823656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07eaa87276a9e2cb43177fa5fa755abb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graham Knight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8823656/graham-knight"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5754,"user_id":8367626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlgmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8367626/mary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569403780,"post_id":58084046,"comment_id":102582815,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084046/vb-net-wpf-application-combobox-not-waiting-for-user-to-choose#comment102582815_58084046"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8823656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07eaa87276a9e2cb43177fa5fa755abb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graham Knight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8823656/graham-knight"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":5754,"user_id":8367626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlgmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8367626/mary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569495435,"post_id":58084046,"comment_id":102619707,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084046/vb-net-wpf-application-combobox-not-waiting-for-user-to-choose#comment102619707_58084046"},{"owner":{"reputation":5754,"user_id":8367626,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Vlgmz.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mary","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8367626/mary"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569612348,"post_id":58084046,"comment_id":102667208,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084046/vb-net-wpf-application-combobox-not-waiting-for-user-to-choose#comment102667208_58084046"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":8823656,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/07eaa87276a9e2cb43177fa5fa755abb?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Graham Knight","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8823656/graham-knight"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":18,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569340271,"creation_date":1569340271,"question_id":58084046,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084046","body_markdown":"I have a wpf vb.net application (written in VS 2019 community) containing two website searches.

If a delete request can&#39;t happen without the validation and marking beforehand you may be able to leverage a preprocessor ([example here][1]) for your `TaskStartRequest`.

hope I can explain my problem clearly enough, without adding too many details. I have a web site where I am trying to make a variable persist between 2 different sessions. One between the user client and the site and one between an external API service and the site. \r\n\r\nStep 1: the user client sends a request to the server using ajax. On the server side this request is handled and if all is well my site sends a request to an external API service. This external service returns **true** if everything checks out and my site sends a success response to the user client side. \r\n\r\nStep 2: after a delay (up to 3 mins) the external API service sends a new separate POST request to a custom callback URL on my site. Now the external service is acting client and my site is acting server. In the function that captures this callback I want to save the posted data with the function save_data().\r\n\r\nStep 3: the user client sends a second ajax call to check if the external service has posted any data yet. Here I want to use the same function save_data() to retrieve the data saved in step 2.\r\n\r\nThis is what I have so far...\r\n\r\n    // callback from external service acting as client\r\n    function _api_callback() {\r\n      $data = json_decode(file_get_contents(&quot;php://input&quot;), $assoc = true);\r\n      save_data(&#39;test&#39;, serialize($data)); // save data from external service\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe function above captures data from the external service and saves it using the function `save_data()`.\r\n\r\n    // ajax call from user client, checking if callback has arrived from external service\r\n    function _check_api_callback() {\r\n      $data = save_data(&#39;test&#39;); // retrieve data saved during external callback session\r\n      drupal_json_output(&#39;data: &#39;.$data);  // debug in console\r\n      drupal_set_message(t(&quot;data: &quot;.$data)); // debug info on page reload\r\n    }\r\n\r\nIn the function above an ajax call from the client side is captured and the function save_data() is used to retrieve data from the external API service, that was saved earlier.\r\n\r\n    // save data from external service to make it available for user client\r\n    function save_data($key, $value = NULL) {\r\n      global $user;\r\n      static $storage;\r\n      if ($value) {\r\n        $storage[$key] = $value;\r\n        $_SESSION[&#39;lists&#39;][$key] = $value;\r\n      }\r\n      else if (empty($storage[$key]) &amp;&amp; isset($_SESSION[&#39;lists&#39;][$key])) {\r\n        $storage[$key] = $_SESSION[&#39;lists&#39;][$key];\r\n      }\r\n      return $storage[$key];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe function above is meant to save data when it&#39;s captured from the external API and also to retrieve the data when the user client checks in to see if the external service has sent any data. I found this function [here][1].\r\n\r\nProblem: the above does not work, nothing is retreived from the function save_data(), so how can I make the data recieved from the external service, available for the second ajax call in step 3 above? \r\n\r\nI should mention also that I know for a fact that the 2nd separate callback from the external service really is recieved with a 200 code, checking the access logs on the site.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/4851/how-do-i-save-session-data-for-the-anonymous-users","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084011/make-variable-persist-between-2-sessions","title":"Make variable persist between 2 sessions"},{"tags":["node.js","protractor","cucumberjs"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":816,"user_id":9150146,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/r3Zq7.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Sergey Pleshakov","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9150146/sergey-pleshakov"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569366621,"post_id":58084010,"comment_id":102571623,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084010/parallel-run-in-chrome#comment102571623_58084010"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":11126063,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aHaHVbfBBp0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABB8/CqXaO7rLHFg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sindhu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11126063/sindhu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569427718,"creation_date":1569427718,"answer_id":58102536,"question_id":58084010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58102536","body_markdown":"Full config as requested\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nconst path = require(&quot;path&quot;);\r\n\r\nconst jsonReports = process.cwd() + &quot;/reports/json&quot;;\r\n\r\nexports.config = {\r\n\r\n  seleniumAddress: &quot;http://localhost:4444/wd/hub&quot;,\r\n\r\n  baseUrl: &quot;https://www.google.co.uk&quot;,\r\n\r\n  multiCapabilities: [\r\n\r\n    {\r\n\r\n      browserName: &quot;chrome&quot;,\r\n\r\n      shardTestFiles: true,\r\n\r\n      maxInstances: 2\r\n\r\n      \r\n    }\r\n\r\n  ],\r\n\r\n  \r\n  framework: &quot;custom&quot;,\r\n\r\n  frameworkPath: require.resolve(&quot;protractor-cucumber-framework&quot;),\r\n\r\n  specs: [&quot;../features/*.feature&quot;],\r\n\r\n  onPrepare: function() {\r\n\r\n    browser.ignoreSynchronization = true;\r\n\r\n    browser.manage().window().maximize();\r\n\r\n \r\n    Reporter.createDirectory(jsonReports);\r\n\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  cucumberOpts: {\r\n\r\n    strict: true,\r\n\r\n    format: &#39;json:./reports/json/cucumber_report.json&#39;,\r\n\r\n    require: [&quot;../stepDefinitions/*.js&quot;],\r\n\r\n    tags: &quot;(@AllureScenario or @CucumberScenario or @ProtractorScenario) and (not @DatabaseTest)&quot; // \r\n\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  onComplete: function () {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n};\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58084010/parallel-run-in-chrome/58102536#58102536","title":"Parallel run in Chrome"}],"owner":{"reputation":27,"user_id":11126063,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-aHaHVbfBBp0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAABB8/CqXaO7rLHFg/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Sindhu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11126063/sindhu"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1192,"user_id":4720362,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":100,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Pkvur.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Oleksii","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4720362/oleksii"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569427718,"creation_date":1569340164,"last_edit_date":1569349798,"question_id":58084010,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58084010","body_markdown":"I am trying to implement parallel test execution in Chrome to reduce the test execution time.

So the fully spelled-out bang operator notation becomes:\r\n\r\n    Debug.Print rs.Fields.Item(&quot;FieldName&quot;).Value\r\n\r\nNow, default member calls that *are* parameterized (/indexed) are usually considered fine, so this is perfectly ok as well:\r\n\r\n    Debug.Print rs.Fields(&quot;FieldName&quot;).Value\r\n\r\nAnything else involves implicit default member calls and makes your code say one thing... and actually do another.\r\n\r\nNote that these unqualified `Range` calls you have in that snippet, are [implicitly referring to whatever the `ActiveSheet` is](http://rubberduckvba.com/Inspections/Details/ImplicitActiveSheetReference), and this is an extremely common source of bugs.\r\n\r\nSee [Modern VBA Best Practices: Default Members](http://rubberduckvba.wordpress.com/?p=7197) for more info on default members and best practices around them (I wrote that article).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083993/add-data-to-adodb-recordset-dynamically/58084886#58084886","title":"Add data to ADODB Recordset

After I remove `QtCore.Qt.Tool` flag, it works fine. Maybe QColorDialog have the same window flag? But I want to hide the window from task bar.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58083976/pyqt5-main-window-will-close-after-qcolordialog-close","title":"PyQt5 Main window will close after QColorDialog close"},{"tags":["r","dataframe","cluster-analysis","k-means","pca"],"owner":{"reputation":10,"user_id":7043438,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/dd86f4ddda8428791a851fb90dd3cc3f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ibetthat","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7043438/ibetthat"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":20,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569340045,"creation_date":1569340045,"question_id":58083974,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58083974","body_markdown":"I have a dataset containing three subsequent measurements (dput at the end) that contains two types of observations:\r\nOne where the values rise over time and a second one where they decline.

Since recently coming out of Python, the way how things work in the language is a bit weird to me but I am getting used to it. \r\n\r\nThe task was to:\r\n&gt;Step 1: Define a ​struct​ that can hold information about bank accounts. First:\r\n■ Each instance will hold the name for the account and an account number. We have created an input file that has at least three accounts, called &quot;accounts.txt&quot;:\r\n\r\n    &quot;moe 6\r\n    larry 28\r\n    curly 42&quot;\r\n\r\nRead a file of account information, filling a vector of account objects. Define local variables corresponding to each data item. Loop through the file, reading into these variables. Clear the vector, reopen the file (call the open method), and​repeat the above, except using curly braced intializers to intialize the instance. Close the file and display all objects.\r\n\r\n&gt;Step 2: Define a ​class t​o hold accounts. Redo the above steps from task 1 that you did with the struct version. Use the ​same​ stream variable! Write getters to access the fields in the accounts when printing. Add an output operator for your class. First, Repeat the print loop using this output operator.Now​ make the output operator a friend, by adding a friend​prototype​ to your account class definition. Add a line in the output operator that prints the fields “directly”, i.e. without using the getters. The vector push_back method will be passed as temporary object defined as the argument to push_back. Repeat the filling of the vector using ​emplace_back ​and again display the contents.\r\n\r\n&gt;Step 3: Add ​transactions​ to your world.\r\nA transaction will be implemented as a class and have a field to indicate whether this is a deposit or a withdrawal and a field to say how much is being deposited or withdrawn. The account class will keep track of transactions applied to it. It will need a vector to store this history of transactions. It will also need a &quot;balance&quot; field to indicate how much is in the account. The account will have methods &quot;deposit&quot; and &quot;withdrawal&quot; which will be passed the amount and will add an appropriate transaction object to the history and modify the balance as needed. The output operator for the account will need to change so that it can display (you format it) the history, i.e. the transactions. When you finish, test this by reading in another file &quot;transactions.txt&quot; that has\r\ncommands such as:\r\n\r\n    &quot;Account moe 6\r\n    Deposit 6 10\r\n    Withdraw 6 100\r\n    Account larry 28\r\n    Withdraw 6 100\r\n    Deposit 6 10\r\n    Deposit 6 10\r\n    Withdraw 6 5\r\n    Account curly 42&quot;\r\n\r\nI am not sure if I opened the file ```accounts.txt``` correctly the way they wanted. I defined it inside the parameter of the function ```readandDisplayUsingStruct```. Is it okay to do it this way? Would it seem like bad style of coding? Anyway, they were very specific in how I should perform this assignment with the steps they provided. It was more restrictive since they did not allow that I would conjure up my own way to do this.\r\n\r\nI provided a snippet of the code I&#39;ve written below.\r\n```\r\n\r\nclass AccountClass\r\n{\r\nprivate:\r\n\tstring name;\r\n\tint accno;\r\n\tvector&lt;Transaction&gt;
