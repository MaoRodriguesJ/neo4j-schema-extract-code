If I inspect the state of the component it has the data that I want but the render method of the component seems to not want to display it.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { Component } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { withAuthorization } from &#39;../Session&#39;;\r\nimport { withFirebase } from &#39;../Firebase&#39;; //\r\nimport &#39;firebase/firestore&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst Home = () =&gt; (\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\r\n    &lt;h1&gt;Home Page&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;p&gt;Signed in users only&lt;/p&gt;\r\n    &lt;hr /&gt;\r\n\r\n    &lt;h1&gt;Available Scopes&lt;/h1&gt;\r\n    &lt;ScopeRender /&gt;\r\n\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\r\n);\r\n\r\n\r\nclass ScopeRenderBase extends Component {\r\n\r\n\tconstructor(props) {\r\n    \tsuper(props);\r\n    \tthis.state = {\r\n    \t\tscopes: []\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t//this.componentDidMount = this.componentDidMount.bind(this);\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\n  \tasync componentDidMount() {\r\n  \t\tawait this.getScopes();\r\n  \t\t//console.log(this.state.scopes);\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\n  \tcomponentDidUpdate() {\r\n  \t\t//console.log(this.state.scopes);\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\n  \tgetScopes() {\r\n  \t\tlet tempScopes = [];\r\n  \t\tthis.props.firebase.db.collection(&quot;scopes&quot;).where(&quot;status&quot;, &quot;==&quot;, 1).get()\r\n  \t\t\t.then( (querySnapshot) =&gt; {\r\n        \t\tquerySnapshot.forEach(function(doc) {\r\n            \t\ttempScopes.push(doc.data().address);\r\n            \t})\r\n        \t})\r\n    \t\t.catch(function(error) {\r\n        \t\tconsole.log(&quot;Error getting documents: &quot;, error);\r\n    \t\t});\r\n\r\n    \t//console.log(tempScopes);\r\n    \tthis.setState({ \r\n  \t\t\tscopes: tempScopes\r\n  \t\t});\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\n  \trender() {\r\n        const displayPosts = this.state.scopes.map((scope, index) =&gt;\r\n            &lt;li key={index}&gt;{scope}&lt;/li&gt;\r\n        );\r\n        console.log(this.state.scopes);\r\n        return(\r\n        \t&lt;div&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;div&gt;{this.state.scopes}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        \t\t&lt;ul&gt;{displayPosts}&lt;/ul&gt;\r\n        \t&lt;/div&gt;\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nconst ScopeRender = withFirebase(ScopeRenderBase);\r\n\r\nconst condition = authUser =&gt; !!authUser;\r\n\r\nexport default withAuthorization(condition)(Home);\r\nexport { ScopeRender };\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this code the state contains the data (scopes) I want after the function getScopes() is called, but the render method does not show the data.\r\n\r\nIf I prefill the data with dummy chars and comment out getScopes() in componentDidMount() like below and keep everything else the same, the dummy chars display just fine.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass ScopeRenderBase extends Component {\r\n\r\n\tconstructor(props) {\r\n    \tsuper(props);\r\n    \tthis.state = {\r\n    \t\tscopes: [&#39;a&#39;,&#39;b&#39;,&#39;c&#39;]\r\n    \t}\r\n    \t//this.componentDidMount = this.componentDidMount.bind(this);\r\n  \t}\r\n\r\n  \tasync componentDidMount() {\r\n  \t\t//await this.getScopes();\r\n  \t\t//console.log(this.state.scopes);\r\n  \t}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI expect the code to display a bulleted list of the array coming from the components state after getScopes() is called as soon as the component mounts, but instead nothing shoes. I have confirmed though through dev tools that the data does exist in the scopes state array, render doesn&#39;t show it though.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494081/react-component-wont-render-new-state-even-after-rerender","title":"React Component won&#39;t render new state even after rerender"},{"tags":["java","android","gradle","intellij-idea","android-gradle-plugin"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":139859,"user_id":128421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71770d043c0f7e3c7bc5f74190015c26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Tin Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128421/the-tin-man"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571702802,"post_id":58494080,"comment_id":103320805,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494080/error-failed-to-resolve-com-google-android-gmsplay-services-analytics18-2-0#comment103320805_58494080"},{"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":7880054,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24d40fa53ef4e6c5ef16e4d6340509e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gurkan stack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7880054/gurkan-stack"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":139859,"user_id":128421,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71770d043c0f7e3c7bc5f74190015c26?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"the Tin Man","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/128421/the-tin-man"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571710064,"post_id":58494080,"comment_id":103321978,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494080/error-failed-to-resolve-com-google-android-gmsplay-services-analytics18-2-0#comment103321978_58494080"}],"owner":{"reputation":68,"user_id":7880054,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":57,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/24d40fa53ef4e6c5ef16e4d6340509e0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"gurkan stack","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7880054/gurkan-stack"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1571719626,"answer_count":0,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1571691693,"creation_date":1571691693,"question_id":58494080,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58494080","body_markdown":"I am getting this error when I sync Gradle.\r\n\r\n**Project-Level Gradle:**\r\n\r\n        buildscript {\r\n        repositories {\r\n            google()\r\n            jcenter()\r\n            maven { url &#39;https://maven.google.com&#39;

You could also try this to remove the invalid characters.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494072/mysterious-whitespace-missing-icon-character-box-displayed-in-chrome-mac-and/58498095#58498095","title":"Mysterious whitespace/&#39;Missing Icon&#39; character box displayed in Chrome (Mac) and MS Edge (Win)"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":18,"user_id":867849,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0dd6edc1c14294219585cde1fafa4aa3?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Jartron","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/867849/jartron"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571791181,"creation_date":1571791181,"answer_id":58513957,"question_id":58494072,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58513957","body_markdown":"Answer: There was a weird character that my Atom editor couldn&#39;t see: &lt;0x03&gt; I opened my PHP file via FTP in Sublime, removed the end-of-text character, saved and that fixed it.

Delete package-lock.json (not package.json!) and/or yarn.lock in your project folder.\r\n  2. Delete node_modules in your project folder.\r\n  3. Remove &quot;eslint&quot; from dependencies and/or devDependencies in the package.json file in your project folder.\r\n  4. Run npm install or yarn, depending on the package manager you use.\r\n\r\nIn most cases, this should be enough to fix the problem.\r\nIf this has not helped, there are a few other things you can try:\r\n\r\n  5. If you used npm, install yarn (http://yarnpkg.com/) and repeat the above steps with it instead.\r\n     This may help because npm has known issues with package hoisting which may get resolved in future versions.\r\n\r\n  6. Check if /Users/shashank/Desktop/TestLinting/WebApplication/client/node_modules/eslint is outside your project directory.\r\n     For example, you might have accidentally installed something in your home folder.\r\n\r\n  7. Try running npm ls eslint in your project folder.\r\n     This will tell you which other package (apart from the expected react-scripts) installed eslint.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else helps, add SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true to an .env file in your project.\r\nThat would permanently disable this preflight check in case you want to proceed anyway.\r\n\r\nP.S. We know this message is long but please read the steps above :-) We hope you find them helpful!\r\n\r\nnpm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE\r\nnpm ERR! errno 1\r\nnpm ERR! eccrine@0.1.0 start: `react-scripts start`\r\nnpm ERR!

However, I&#39;m trying to mind separation of concerns and want to add the event dynamically. I&#39;m trying to do this with the following:\r\n\r\n    const tab = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.tablinks&quot;);\r\n    const content = document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.tabcontent&quot;);\r\n    \r\n    for (let i = 0; i &lt; tab.length; i++) {\r\n        let conId = tab[i].getAttribute(&#39;data-target&#39;);\r\n        let conArray = Array.from(content);\r\n        let con = conArray.find((c) =&gt; c.getAttribute(&#39;id&#39;) === conId);\r\n        let c = con.getAttribute(&#39;id&#39;);\r\n        tab[i].addEventListener(&#39;click&#39;, tabbedWindows(event,c), false);\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t work due to the following error: main.js:23 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property &#39;currentTarget&#39; of undefined. The line it&#39;s failing on is:\r\n\r\n    evt.currentTarget.className += &quot; active&quot;;\r\n\r\nI think the reason for this is by the time the function attempts to attach the listener, event variable is already out of scope. That is just what I&#39;ve been able to glean from research. The long and the short of it is I&#39;m stumped and not even sure if this is the correct approach. I guess some questions I have are:\r\n\r\n 1. Why does &#39;event&#39; work as a variable when passed through an onclick attribute but not when passed in as a parameter to the function invoked through the for loop? I think I&#39;ve already answered this question but maybe someone more knowledgeable can provide a better description.\r\n 2. My for loop seems unnecessarily convoluted. Am I overcomplicating things here? I&#39;m guessing &#39;yes&#39;.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494061/how-to-resolve-issue-with-addeventlistener-cannot-read-property-currenttarget","title":"How to resolve issue with addEventListener: Cannot read property &#39;currentTarget&#39; of undefined"},{"tags":["unity3d","ibm-watson"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1077,"user_id":5829906,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aeaf232670edf096dea4ef778d02d5df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MrRobot9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5829906/mrrobot9"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571771654,"post_id":58510822,"comment_id":103349354,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494060/ibm-watson-text-to-speech-credentials-hasiamtokendata-returning-null-everytime/58510822#comment103349354_58510822"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9036714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bH8Uo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Damla Altunay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9036714/damla-altunay"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1077,"user_id":5829906,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":97,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/aeaf232670edf096dea4ef778d02d5df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"MrRobot9","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5829906/mrrobot9"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571838881,"post_id":58510822,"comment_id":103373859,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494060/ibm-watson-text-to-speech-credentials-hasiamtokendata-returning-null-everytime/58510822#comment103373859_58510822"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":9036714,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/bH8Uo.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Damla Altunay","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9036714/damla-altunay"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571771244,"creation_date":1571771244,"answer_id":58510822,"question_id":58494060,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58510822","body_markdown":"Service endpoint url should be declared.

Without this, the div&#39;s width would be the image&#39;s width == No centering.\r\n\r\n-The *display: grid* declares the div to be a grid item. It makes the div function kinda like a table with rows and columns. However, the coolest thing about grid is it can center its child elements for you through the *justify-contents* or the *justify-self* attribute.\r\n\r\n-The *justify-self: center* make the element centered within its parent element. This is only possible if the parent is a grid (above) or a flexbox which is another wonderful choice. In face, you can replace *display: grid* with *display: flex* and you&#39;d get the same result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Extra advice:** \r\n\r\n-It&#39;s really cool that you are exploring css. I definitely recommend looking up css flexbox and grid.

The context is a video game save system. I can remove some parts of the uncompressed file, but I would like to know how to guide my efforts, by finding out which parts of the uncompressed data contribute most to the final compressed file size.\r\n\r\nI know I shouldn&#39;t just remove the things that are most numerous, since they often prove to be very compressible and will not take up much space in the resulting compressed file.\r\n\r\nI imagine that it&#39;s possible to, for each byte in the uncompressed data, calculate how much that byte contributes to the overall compressed file size. Programs like 7-zip show you how much files in an archive are compressed - this is just taking that to the extreme!\r\n\r\nI don&#39;t know quite enough about compression to know if this is a sensible thing to ask for - but as far as I understand, this could be done by dividing the cost of each byte amongst each used &#39;reference&#39; to a byte block that the byte is contained within. More frequently repeated blocks would have their cost lowered, and more unique blocks (with no references) would not have their cost lowered.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense, and are there any algorithms for doing this kind of thing?

The window console lets me manipulate the display property of each modal by ````document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.modal&quot;).forEach((modal) =&gt; modal.style.display = &quot;block&quot;)```` successfully but the thing is after ```` document.querySelectorAll(&quot;.cols&quot;).forEach((col) =&gt; col.childNodes[0].style.display = &quot;block&quot;)```` it just works for 2 of them, even if all of them are the same.\r\n(index.js)\r\n````javascript\r\n    const openModal = (elem) =&gt; {\r\n        const col = document.getElementById(elem);\r\n        col.childNodes[0].classList.add(&quot;.shown&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    for(let i = 0; i++; i&lt;cols.length) {\r\n        (function() {\r\n            const elem = cols[i].id;\r\n            cols[i].addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, openModal(elem), false);\r\n        }());\r\n    };\r\n```` \r\n(index.pug)\r\n````\r\n            .cols#communication\r\n                .modal //Content1 \r\n                ...\r\n            .cols#backstory\r\n                .modal //Content2\r\n                ...\r\n            .cols#menu \r\n                .modal //Content3\r\n                 ...\r\n        .rows \r\n            .cols#specials\r\n                .modal //Content4\r\n                 ...\r\n            .cols#services\r\n                .modal //Content5\r\n                ...\r\n            .cols#gallery\r\n                .modal //Content6\r\n                ...\r\n````\r\n(index.scss)\r\n````\r\n.rows {\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    flex-direction: row;\r\n    justify-content: space-evenly;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n}\r\n.shown {\r\n    display: block;\r\n    animation-name: modal-fade;\r\n    animation-duration: 1.5s;\r\n}\r\n@keyframes modal-fade {\r\n    from {opacity: .4} \r\n    to {opacity: 1}\r\n}\r\n@mixin modal {\r\n    display: none;\r\n    position: absolute;\r\n    width: 80vw;\r\n    height: 80vh;\r\n    border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\r\n    box-shadow: 0 4px 8px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.2),0 6px 20px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.19);\r\n    background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);\r\n    @include font(white, $fontSizeM);\r\n}\r\n.modal {\r\n    @include modal;\r\n}\r\n````","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58494035/the-modal-doesnt-display-on-screen","title":"The modal doesnt display on screen"},{"tags":["dji-sdk"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12193592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3814623b4e133b4a7e334389bf7bc308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"erenaud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12193592/erenaud"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12193592,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/3814623b4e133b4a7e334389bf7bc308?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"erenaud","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12193592/erenaud"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571746937,"last_edit_date":1571746937,"creation_date":1571745856,"answer_id":58503909,"question_id":58494032,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58503909","body_markdown":"If you&#39;re willing to use `/dji_sdk/set_hardsyc` service, you have to set some hardware synchronization mechanism.

[A]nyone can point out how to use Json marshall to convert the byte to the same type of bytes as the first one?\r\n\r\nThis isn&#39;t the right question, but I think I know what you&#39;re asking. You say you&#39;re getting the 2nd array via JSON marshalling, but that it&#39;s also not under your control:\r\n\r\n&gt; it was obtained by json marshal (convert a received float array to byte array, and then convert the result to base64 string, which is done by someone else)\r\n\r\nThat&#39;s fine though, you just have to do a few steps of processing to get to a state equivalent to the first set of bytes.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFirst, some context to what&#39;s going on. You&#39;ve already seen that `numpy` can understand your first set of bytes.\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; numpy.frombuffer(data)\r\n[1.21  2.963 1.   ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on its output, it looks like `numpy` is interpreting your data as 3 doubles, with 8 bytes each (24 bytes total)...\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; data = b&#39;\\\\\\x8f\\xc2\\xf5(\\\\\\xf3?Nb\\x10X9\\xb4\\x07@\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\x00\\xf0?&#39;\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; len(data)\r\n24\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which the `struct` module can also interpret.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Separate into 3 doubles\r\nx, y, z = data[:8], data[8:16], data[16:]\r\nprint([struct.unpack(&#39;d&#39;, i) for i in (x, y, z)])\r\n\r\n[(1.21,), (2.963,), (1.0,)\r\n```\r\n\r\n-----\r\nThere&#39;s actually (at least) 2 ways you can get a `numpy` array out of this.\r\n\r\n## Short way\r\n\r\n### 1. Convert to string\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Original JSON data (snipped)\r\njunk = b&#39;[-2.1997713216,-1.4249271187,-1.1076795391,...]&#39;\r\n# Decode from bytes to a string (defaults to utf-8), then\r\n# trim off the brackets (first and last characters in the string)\r\nas_str = junk.decode()[1:-1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Use `numpy.fromstring`\r\n\r\n```\r\nnumpy.fromstring(as_str, dtype=float, sep=&#39;,&#39;)\r\n\r\n# Produces:\r\narray([-2.19977132, -1.42492712, -1.10767954,  1.5224958 , -0.17097962,\r\n        0.36638757,  0.14846441, -0.74159301, -1.76022319,  0.12660569,\r\n        0.60109348, -0.46641536,  1.56755258,  1.00836295,  1.4332793 ,\r\n        0.61133843, -1.80085406, -0.94434089,  1.09436704, -1.01146427,\r\n        1.44389263, -0.27094273,  0.29904625,  0.46501336,  0.25607913,\r\n        0.22576005, -2.40774298, -0.05099832,  1.00621871,  0.43150758,\r\n        ... ])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Long way\r\n\r\n**Note**: I found the `fromstring` method after writing this part up, figured I&#39;d leave it here to at least help explain the byte differences.\r\n\r\n### 1. Convert the JSON data into an array of numeric values.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Original JSON data (snipped)\r\njunk = b&#39;[-2.1997713216,-1.4249271187,-1.1076795391,...]&#39;\r\n# Decode from bytes to a string - defaults to utf-8\r\njunk = junk.decode()\r\n# Trim off the brackets - First and last characters in the string\r\njunk = junk[1:-1]\r\n# Separate into values\r\njunk = junk.split(&#39;,&#39;)\r\n# Convert to numerical values\r\ndoubles = [float(val) for val in junk]\r\n\r\n# Or, as a one-liner\r\ndoubles = [float(val) for val in junk.decode()[1:-1].split(&#39;,&#39;)]\r\n\r\n# &quot;doubles&quot; currently holds:\r\n[-2.1997713216,\r\n -1.4249271187,\r\n -1.1076795391,\r\n 1.5224958034,\r\n ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Use `struct` to get byte-representations for the doubles\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport struct\r\nas_bytes = [struct.pack(&#39;d&#39;, val) for val in doubles]\r\n\r\n# &quot;as_bytes&quot; currently holds:\r\n[b&#39;\\x08\\x9b\\xe7\\xb4!\\x99\\x01\\xc0&#39;,\r\n b&#39;\\x0b\\x00\\xe0`\\x80\\xcc\\xf6\\xbf&#39;,\r\n b&#39;+ ..\\x0e\\xb9\\xf1\\xbf&#39;,\r\n b&#39;hg&gt;\\x8f$\\\\\\xf8?&#39;,\r\n ...]\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Join all the double values (as bytes) into a single byte-string, then submit to numpy\r\n\r\n```\r\nnew_data = b&#39;&#39;.join(as_bytes)\r\nnumpy.frombuffer(new_data)\r\n\r\n# Produces:\r\narray([-2.19977132, -1.42492712, -1.10767954,  1.5224958 , -0.17097962,\r\n        0.36638757,  0.14846441, -0.74159301, -1.76022319,  0.12660569,\r\n        0.60109348, -0.46641536,  1.56755258,  1.00836295,  1.4332793 ,\r\n        0.61133843, -1.80085406, -0.94434089,  1.09436704, -1.01146427,\r\n        1.44389263, -0.27094273,  0.29904625,  0.46501336,  0.25607913,\r\n        0.22576005, -2.40774298, -0.05099832,  1.00621871,  0.43150758,\r\n        ... ])\r\n\r\n\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493996/why-python-has-different-types-of-bytes/58506470#58506470","title":"Why python has different types of bytes"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":104927,"user_id":235698,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KjvlE.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Mark Tolonen","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/235698/mark-tolonen"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571778306,"creation_date":1571778306,"answer_id":58512303,"question_id":58493996,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58512303","body_markdown":"A `bytes` object can be in any format.

I have looked up all possible  solutions for front end, the only thing I have found is private IP address solutions or 3rd party.\r\n\r\nI have arrived at the conclusion that the browser doesn&#39;t provide the public IP to scripts running on a browser.\r\n\r\nWhat are my options here? How can I find the IP address of people landing on my website(preferably front end solution).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493991/getting-an-ip-address-without-a-3rd-party-service","title":"Getting an IP address without a 3rd party service"},{"tags":["javascript","if-statement","calculator"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":44447,"user_id":695364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUNjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/695364/scott-marcus"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571691440,"post_id":58493990,"comment_id":103317907,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493990/if-statement-not-returning-a-value#comment103317907_58493990"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12253905,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9823b36f5f02b94d96242d76745ca8dd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"skully","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12253905/skully"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":44447,"user_id":695364,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CUNjJ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Scott Marcus","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/695364/scott-marcus"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571692298,"post_id":58493990,"comment_id":103318215,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493990/if-statement-not-returning-a-value#comment103318215_58493990"},{"owner":{"reputation":3952,"user_id":8698101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a32951f0068d47dfdc1dfc90ff44612b?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"B.

I&#39;ve found examples such as this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37404405/how-to-get-logical-drives-names-in-windows-10, but this provides the removable drives only (Flash drives, DVD drive, etc).\r\n\r\nI know I can allow the user to select a folder and that&#39;ll provide me with the handle to the selected drive, but it seems clunky as I want the user to be able to run my software and scan the internal disks on the PC without having to re-select the drives every time.\r\n\r\nI&#39;ve added the broadFileSystemAccess attribute to the manifest so have access to the disks, I just can&#39;t call a method to get the internal drives. As a workaround, I&#39;ve written the following method.\r\n\r\n```cs\r\npublic List&lt;StorageFolder&gt; GetInternalDrives()\r\n{\r\n    string driveLetters = &quot;ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;;\r\n    int driveLettersLen = driveLetters.Length;\r\n    string removableDriveLetters = &quot;&quot;;\r\n    string driveLetter;\r\n\r\n    List&lt;StorageFolder&gt; drives = new List&lt;StorageFolder&gt;();\r\n    StorageFolder removableDevices = KnownFolders.RemovableDevices;\r\n    IReadOnlyList&lt;StorageFolder&gt; folders = Task.Run&lt;IReadOnlyList&lt;StorageFolder&gt;&gt;(async () =&gt; await removableDevices.GetFoldersAsync()).Result;\r\n\r\n    foreach (StorageFolder removableDevice in folders)\r\n    {\r\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(removableDevice.Path)) continue;\r\n        driveLetter = removableDevice.Path.Substring(0, 1).ToUpper();\r\n        if (driveLetters.IndexOf(driveLetter) &gt; -1) removableDriveLetters += driveLetter;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    for (int curDrive = 0; curDrive &lt; driveLettersLen; curDrive++)\r\n    {\r\n        driveLetter = driveLetters.Substring(curDrive, 1);\r\n        if (removableDriveLetters.IndexOf(driveLetter) &gt; -1) continue;\r\n\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            StorageFolder drive = Task.Run&lt;StorageFolder&gt;(async () =&gt; await StorageFolder.GetFolderFromPathAsync(driveLetter + &quot;:&quot;)).Result;\r\n            drives.Add(drive);\r\n        }\r\n        catch (System.AggregateException) { }\r\n                \r\n    }\r\n            \r\n    return drives;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here&#39;s an example of GetInternalDrives being called:\r\n\r\n```cs\r\nList&lt;StorageFolder&gt; drives = GetInternalDrives();\r\npanScanParams.Children.Clear();\r\nforeach (StorageFolder drive in drives)\r\n{\r\n    CheckBox cb = new CheckBox();\r\n    cb.Content = drive.DisplayName;\r\n    cb.IsChecked = true;\r\n    panScanParams.Children.Add(cb);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhilst the code is only invoked once for an instance of the app, I&#39;m not at all happy with the code. As it calls StorageFolder.GetFolderFromPathAsync for every letter of the alphabet, it crashes over 20 times on my machine. Writing code which you expect to fail and handling the exception just seems bad practice. But with the lack of a suitable alternative, I don&#39;t know what other options I have.\r\n\r\nHas anyone tackled the same problem, and if so, what did you do to resolve it?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493950/get-internal-drives-using-windows-storage-namespace-in-uwp","title":"Get Internal Drives Using Windows.Storage Namespace in UWP"},{"tags":["neo4j","cypher"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":46094,"user_id":974731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f54ba41697411b238379022f9a6df56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cybersam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/974731/cybersam"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1571696751,"post_id":58493948,"comment_id":103319421,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493948/unwind-multiple-relationships-and-gathering-nodes-and-relationships-with-null#comment103319421_58493948"}],"owner":{"reputation":8,"user_id":10768865,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/71dadecdbdbd6a924cf3ee0f176263a0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Stephanie","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10768865/stephanie"},"last_editor":{"reputation":46094,"user_id":974731,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8f54ba41697411b238379022f9a6df56?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"cybersam","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/974731/cybersam"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":14,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571696762,"creation_date":1571691019,"last_edit_date":1571696762,"question_id":58493948,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493948","body_markdown":"Is there a way to do the following?\r\n```\r\nMATCH (main {Identifier: &quot;Main&quot;})\r\nUNWIND\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH1]-&gt;(n1)-[rel1:REL]-&gt;(end1) | n1] +\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH2]-&gt;(n2)-[rel2:REL]-&gt;(end2) | n2] AS node\r\nUNWIND\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH1]-&gt;(n1)-[rel1:REL]-&gt;(end1) | end1] +\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH2]-&gt;(n2)-[rel2:REL]-&gt;(end2) | end2] AS end\r\nUNWIND\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH1]-&gt;(n1)-[rel1:REL]-&gt;(end1) | rel1] +\r\n  [(main)-[:MULTI_JUMP_PATH2]-&gt;(n2)-[rel2:REL]-&gt;(end2) | rel2] AS rel\r\nRETURN DISTINCT main, node, end, rel\r\n```\r\nBasically, I am seeking a more direct way to start from main and get the equivalent of:\r\n```\r\n(node=n1+n2)-[rel=rel1+rel2:REL]-&gt;(end=end1+end2)\r\n```\r\nwithout losing main.

PSSR is *&quot;probabilistic signature scheme with recovery&quot;*. The message is include in the signature with a mask function.\r\n\r\nYou would need the original message with a SSA scheme. SSA is *&quot;signature scheme with appendix&quot;*. In a SSA scheme you need to provide both the original message and the signature.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n(From the comments) Here is an example that uses a Signature Scheme with Appendix (SSA). It also uses `std::iftream` and `std::ofstream` directly so `FileSource` and `FileSink` work as you expect. `std::ofstream` includes `std::ios_base::app` so the signature is appended.\r\n\r\n```c++\r\n#include &quot;cryptlib.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;filters.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;osrng.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;files.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;oaep.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;rsa.h&quot;\r\n#include &quot;sha.h&quot;\r\n\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;fstream&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string&gt;\r\n\r\nint main(int argc, char* argv[])\r\n{\r\n    using namespace CryptoPP;\r\n    AutoSeededRandomPool prng;\r\n    std::string fname(&quot;test.bin&quot;);\r\n\r\n    ///// Create test message /////\r\n    {\r\n    std::string msg(&quot;Yoda said, Do or do not.

When `i = 1`, it calculates `map[i]` (which is not what you want) by skipping the whole data structure. You need the following:\r\n\r\n        printf(&quot;%d &quot;, (*map)[i][j]);\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo elaborate on what the incorrect code does: let&#39;s take an example `i = 0, j = 3`. I use the idea that `*pointer` is the same as `pointer[0]`. Then:\r\n\r\n* `map[i]` = `map[0]` = `*map` = the thing that `map` points to. This is the whole 2-D array.\r\n* `map[i][j]` = `map[0][3]` = the element with index 3 in `*map` = the row of your array with index 3\r\n* `*map[i][j]` = `*map[0][3]` = `map[0][3][0]` = the first element in row with index 3\r\n\r\nAnother example: `i = 4, j = 8`. Then:\r\n\r\n* `map[i]` = `map[4]` = element with index 4 in an infinite 3-D array whose elements are 2-D arrays `int[9][9]`.

The problem is when I try to print the returned array it prints the first index of each row in the first row and then a bunch of zeros in every other row. I&#39;ve tried a few different ways of dereferencing individual indices, and it seems like my array changes once I reference it outside of my readMap() function, but I have no idea why this is happening. Here is my code so far:\r\n\r\n    #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n    #include &lt;string.h&gt;\r\n    #define BUFFER_SIZE 20\r\n    typedef int MAP_ARRAY[9][9];\r\n    \r\n    MAP_ARRAY * readMap(const char *fileName);\r\n    \r\n    int main (int argc, char *argv[]) {\r\n    \r\n        MAP_ARRAY *map;\r\n        map = readMap(argv[1]);\r\n        for(int i = 0; i&lt;9; i++){\r\n          for(int j = 0; j&lt;9; j++){\r\n            printf(&quot;%d &quot;, *map[i][j]);\r\n          }\r\n          printf(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);\r\n    \r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    MAP_ARRAY* readMap(const char *fileName){\r\n        FILE *mapFile;\r\n        char *line = NULL;\r\n        size_t buffSize = BUFFER_SIZE;\r\n        size_t numChars;\r\n        static MAP_ARRAY returnMap;\r\n        mapFile = fopen(fileName,&quot;r&quot;);\r\n    \r\n        if(mapFile == NULL){\r\n          printf(&quot;Failed to open file.&quot;);\r\n            exit(EXIT_FAILURE);\r\n        }\r\n        // Allocate space for line buffer\r\n        line = (char *)malloc(buffSize * sizeof(char));\r\n        int currLine = 0;\r\n        while((numChars = getline(&amp;line, &amp;buffSize, mapFile)) != -1 &amp;&amp; currLine &lt; 9){\r\n          char* token = strtok(line, &quot;,&quot;);\r\n          int input;\r\n          int currIndex = 0;\r\n          while(token != NULL &amp;&amp; currIndex &lt; 9){\r\n            input = atoi(token);\r\n            returnMap[currLine][currIndex] = input;\r\n            token = strtok(NULL, &quot;,&quot;);\r\n            currIndex++;\r\n          }\r\n          currLine++;\r\n        }\r\n        for(int i = 0; i&lt;9; i++){\r\n          for(int j = 0; j&lt;9; j++){\r\n            printf(&quot;%d &quot;, returnMap[i][j]);\r\n          }\r\n          printf(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n        }\r\n        printf(&quot;\\n&quot;);\r\n        fclose(mapFile);\r\n        return &amp;returnMap;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe output I get for this is\r\n\r\n    6 2 4 5 3 9 1 7 7\r\n    5 1 9 7 2 8 6 3 4\r\n    8 3 7 6 1 4 2 9 5\r\n    1 4 3 8 6 5 7 2 9\r\n    9 5 8 2 4 7 3 6 1\r\n    7 6 2 3 9 1 4 5 8\r\n    3 7 1 9 5 6 8 4 2\r\n    4 9 6 1 8 2 5 7 3\r\n    2 8 5 4 7 3 9 1 6\r\n    \r\n    6 5 8 1 9 7 3 4 2\r\n    0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\r\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493930/why-is-my-function-incorrectly-returning-part-of-my-2d-array","closed_reason":"off-topic","title":"Why is my function incorrectly returning part of my 2D array?"},{"tags":["matlab","grid","geotiff"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3783,"user_id":7054628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b8a407b941b80036020e1fad879bd2d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rinkert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7054628/rinkert"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571691358,"post_id":58493927,"comment_id":103317872,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493927/convert-large-xyz-file-into-gridded-data-matlab#comment103317872_58493927"},{"owner":{"reputation":64,"user_id":5618251,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":64,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/ff23f5a9577a8c2380d0638cce534d42?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"user5618251","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5618251/user5618251"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":3783,"user_id":7054628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b8a407b941b80036020e1fad879bd2d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rinkert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7054628/rinkert"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571693985,"post_id":58493927,"comment_id":103318718,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493927/convert-large-xyz-file-into-gridded-data-matlab#comment103318718_58493927"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":3783,"user_id":7054628,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":71,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5b8a407b941b80036020e1fad879bd2d?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rinkert","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/7054628/rinkert"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571694999,"creation_date":1571694999,"answer_id":58494634,"question_id":58493927,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58494634","body_markdown":"You were almost there...

However, julia has a special syntax to make an array with whatever eltype you like. So, to create an array with eltype `T`, you just write `T[x, y, z]` instead of `[x, y, z]`. For your example, this would be\r\n```julia\r\njulia&gt; v = Any[1,2,3]\r\np3-element Array{Any,1}:\r\n 1\r\n 2\r\n 3\r\n\r\njulia&gt; push!(v, &quot;foo&quot;)\r\n4-element Array{Any,1}:\r\n 1\r\n 2\r\n 3\r\n  &quot;foo&quot;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for this behaviour is that if we can restrict an array to be of a specific, concrete type, there are some major performance optimizations that can be made. If you have an array with eltype `Any`, then the contents cannot be densely packed in memory.

Make use of the AnimatedWidget&#39;s onEnd callback to change visibility. Also, you may want to use the Visibility widget for this. It lets you even maintain the child&#39;s state if you want. \r\n\r\n    /// somewhere outside of build in a StatefulWidget\r\n    bool _isVisible = true;\r\n    bool _isOpaque = true;\r\n    \r\n\r\n    /// within the build method\r\n    AnimatedOpacity(\r\n      opacity: _isOpaque ? 1.0 : 0.0,\r\n      onEnd: (){\r\n        if(!_isOpaque)\r\n          setState((){\r\n            _isVisible = false;\r\n          });\r\n      },\r\n      child: Visibility(\r\n        child: child,\r\n        visible: _isVisible,\r\n      ),\r\n    );\r\n    \r\n\r\n    //then in some method to toggle the state...\r\n    setState((){\r\n      if(!_isVisible){\r\n        _isVisible = true;\r\n        _isOpaque = true;\r\n      }\r\n      else{\r\n        _isOpaque = false;\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n\r\n\r\nCome to think of it, you also have AnimatedSwitcher which is a LOT easier to do this.

./launchAdminProgram &amp;&amp; ....&quot; with administrator privileges&#39;\r\n```\r\nif I copy and paste the above in the terminal, the GUI login pops up, I type the password in and everything runs as expected.\r\n\r\nI have done quite a bit of searching around and haven&#39;t really found any leads as to why this is happening. \r\n\r\nI am on High Sierra and the latest Go from homebrew (go1.13.3 darwin/amd64).","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493880/go-cmd-run-successfully-runs-osascript-with-no-errors-but-gui-password-prompt","title":"Go cmd.Run() successfully runs osascript with no errors but gui password prompt does not show and it gets stuck"},{"tags":["c#"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1441,"user_id":10552687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fd4bd62f003f927fbf2881ba3a31716?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dvo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10552687/dvo"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1571690813,"post_id":58493879,"comment_id":103317673,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493879/im-having-trouble-getting-the-txt-file-to-be-displayed-im-assuming-something#comment103317673_58493879"},{"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12055696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e57d6749a2917534b6547f7ea8c49f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Minh Phan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12055696/minh-phan"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":1441,"user_id":10552687,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9fd4bd62f003f927fbf2881ba3a31716?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"dvo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10552687/dvo"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1571693059,"post_id":58493879,"comment_id":103318445,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493879/im-having-trouble-getting-the-txt-file-to-be-displayed-im-assuming-something#comment103318445_58493879"}],"owner":{"reputation":2,"user_id":12055696,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2e57d6749a2917534b6547f7ea8c49f0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Minh Phan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12055696/minh-phan"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":1,"is_answered":false,"view_count":28,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571690668,"creation_date":1571690668,"question_id":58493879,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493879","body_markdown":"        public class Program\r\n        {\r\n            private static readonly ILog logger = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger\r\n                (System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);\r\n    \r\n            public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n            {\r\n                log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator.Configure();\r\n    \r\n                logger.Debug(&quot;Starting the main driver program&quot;);\r\n    \r\n                ShapeManager manager = new ShapeManager(&quot;data.txt&quot;);\r\n                manager.DisplayShapes();\r\n    \r\n                logger.Debug(&quot;Exiting the main program&quot;);\r\n                System.Console.ReadLine();\r\n    \r\n    _______________________________\r\n    \r\n    public class ShapeManager\r\n        {\r\n            private static readonly ILog logger =\r\n                log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(System.Reflection.MethodBase.GetCurrentMethod().DeclaringType);\r\n    \r\n            private string datafile;\r\n            private List&lt;Shape&gt;

But this section of Tcl&#39;s internal are comparable to current sources, tested using my Tcl 8.6 source installation.\r\n\r\nFor the records\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nWith a stock shell (`tclsh`), this is a little fiddly, I am afraid. The following might work for you (though, I can imagine cases where this might fail you). The idea is \r\n\r\n  - to intercept writes to `stderr` (this is to where an interactive shell redirects error messages, before returning to the prompt). \r\n  - to discriminate between arbitrary writes to `stderr` and error cases, one can use the global variable `::errorInfo` as a sentinel.\r\n\r\nStep 1: Define a channel interceptor\r\n------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    oo::class create Bouncer {\r\n        method initialize {handle mode} {\r\n            if {$mode ne &quot;write&quot;} {error &quot;can&#39;t handle reading&quot;}\r\n            return {finalize initialize write}\r\n        }\r\n        method finalize {handle} {\r\n            # NOOP\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n        method write {handle bytes} {\r\n            if {[info exists ::errorInfo]} {\r\n    \t    # This is an actual error;\r\n    \t    # 1) Print the message (as usual), but to stdout\r\n    \t    fconfigure stdout -translation binary\r\n    \t    puts stdout $bytes\r\n    \t    # 2) Call on [exit] to quit the Tcl process\r\n    \t    exit 1\r\n    \t} else {\r\n    \t    # Non-error write to stderr, proceed as usual\r\n                return $bytes\r\n    \t}\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nStep 2: Register the interceptor for `stderr` in interactive shells\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n    if {[info exists ::tcl_interactive]} {\r\n        chan push stderr [Bouncer new]\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOnce registered, this will make your interactive shell behave like so:\r\n\r\n    % puts stderr &quot;Goes, as usual!&quot;\r\n    Goes, as usual!\r\n    % error &quot;Bye, bye&quot;\r\n    Bye, bye\r\n\r\nSome remarks\r\n------------\r\n\r\n - You need to be careful about the `Bouncer`&#39;s `write` method, the error message has already been massaged for the character encoding (therefore, the `fconfigure` call).\r\n - You might want to put this into a Tcl package or Tcl module, to load the bouncer using `package req`.\r\n - I could imagine that your program writes to `stderr` and the `errorInfo` variable happens to be set (as a left-over), this will trigger an unintended exit.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58493869/is-it-possible-to-enable-exit-on-error-behavior-in-an-interactive-tcl-shell/58505517#58505517","title":"Is it possible to enable exit on error behavior in an interactive Tcl shell?"}],"owner":{"reputation":183,"user_id":3926793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c312ad7229c8846527e9b0523f5f8545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Larry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926793/larry"},"last_editor":{"reputation":183,"user_id":3926793,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c312ad7229c8846527e9b0523f5f8545?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Larry","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926793/larry"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1571864276,"creation_date":1571690625,"last_edit_date":1571825274,"question_id":58493869,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58493869","body_markdown":"I need to automate a huge interactive Tcl program using Tcl expect.\r\n\r\nAs I realized, this territory is really dangerous, as I need to extend the already existing mass of code, but I can&#39;t rely on errors actually causing the program to fail with a positive exit code as I could in a regular script.\r\nThis means I have to think about every possible thing that could go wrong and &quot;expect&quot; it.\r\n\r\nWhat I currently do is use a &quot;die&quot; procedure instead of raising an error in my own code, that automatically exits.
