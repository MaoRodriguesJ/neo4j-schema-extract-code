This doesn&#39;t make it unsafe to load\r\nyour YAML file, unless the objects created from those tags have unsafe\r\nside-effects on initiation.\r\n\r\nUsing tags also allows you to dump (and load) the data-structure you\r\nhave in memory even if you have at some point in your development\r\nreferences from more than one object to one specific other object or\r\nwhen you have objects with (indirect) references to itself. These will\r\nbe dumped using anchors and aliases, and it is non-trivial to resolve\r\nthese things yourself when dumping without using tags, as you would\r\nneed to keep track of already dumped objects.\r\n\r\nUnittest for individual can easily be written. Normally the only thing you\r\nhave to make sure is that you can create a scene without actions, then you can \r\ntest everything for the scene that doesn&#39;t involve actions, etc.\r\n\r\nPyYAML can parse all of the YAML 1.1 specification, but cannot load\r\nall of that spec. Additionally YAML 1.2 has been out for ten years now.\r\nNeither might be a restriction for your program, but I do recommend to \r\nuse `ruamel.yaml`, which does not have these problems \r\n(disclaimer: I am the author of that package). How to dump/load classes\r\nwith `ruamel.yaml` is described [here](https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dumpcls.html)\r\n\r\n    import sys\r\n    from pathlib import Path\r\n    import ruamel.yaml\r\n\r\n    data_file = Path(&#39;data.yaml&#39;)\r\n\r\n    yaml = ruamel.yaml.YAML(typ=&#39;safe&#39;)\r\n\r\n    @yaml.register_class\r\n    class Scene:\r\n        def __init__(self, sc_parm, actions):\r\n           self.sc_parm = sc_parm\r\n           self.actions = actions\r\n\r\n    @yaml.register_class\r\n    class Action:\r\n        def __init__(self, ac_parm1, ac_parm2):\r\n            self.ac_parm1 = ac_parm2\r\n            self.ac_parm2 = ac_parm2\r\n\r\n\r\n    shared_action = Action(&#39;south&#39;, 1)\r\n\r\n    data = [\r\n        Scene(&#39;sc1_parm_val&#39;, []), \r\n        Scene(&#39;sc2_parm_val&#39;, [Action(&#39;north&#39;, 3), shared_action]),\r\n        Scene(&#39;sc3_parm_val&#39;, [shared_action, Action(&#39;west&#39;, 2)]),\r\n    ]\r\n\r\n    yaml.dump(data, data_file)\r\n\r\n    print(data_file.read_text(), end=&#39;&#39;)\r\n    print(&#39;=+&#39;*30)\r\n    d2 = yaml.load(data_file)\r\n\r\n    for d in d2:\r\n        print(d.sc_parm, d.actions)\r\n\r\nwhich gives:\r\n\r\n    - !Scene\r\n      actions: []\r\n      sc_parm: sc1_parm_val\r\n    - !Scene\r\n      actions:\r\n      - !Action {ac_parm1: 3, ac_parm2: 3}\r\n      - &amp;id001 !Action {ac_parm1: 1, ac_parm2: 1}\r\n      sc_parm: sc2_parm_val\r\n    - !Scene\r\n      actions:\r\n      - *id001\r\n      - !Action {ac_parm1: 2, ac_parm2: 2}\r\n      sc_parm: sc3_parm_val\r\n    =+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+=+\r\n    sc1_parm_val []\r\n    sc2_parm_val [&lt;__main__.Action object at 0x7f009be56f28&gt;, &lt;__main__.Action object at 0x7f009be56fd0&gt;]\r\n    sc3_parm_val [&lt;__main__.Action object at 0x7f009be56fd0&gt;, &lt;__main__.Action object at 0x7f009be56e48&gt;]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the IDs of the `Action` objects, the second action\r\nof the second scene is again the same as the first action of the last\r\nscene (the original `shared_action`)\r\n\r\nMake sure, that if you decide to make your own `from_yaml` (instead of\r\nrelying on the default you get by registering), e.g. in order to limit\r\nthe attributes that get dumped, that you use the two step process of\r\ncreating your objects as this is necessary to allow for recursive data\r\nstructures in your tree. You might not need this right away, but it is\r\nrather easy to do and e.g. described\r\n[here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51827378/1307905) for the\r\nround-trip loader (a safe-loader that can preserve comments, quoting\r\nstyles, alias names etc when loading then dumping YAML).\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228199/best-practice-for-oop-style-loading-of-nested-objects-from-a-yaml-file/58232008#58232008","title":"Best practice for OOP style loading of nested objects from a YAML file"}],"owner":{"reputation":300,"user_id":8010295,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/920d54d99a4812b73a65b14c5fc6318e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Jinglesting","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8010295/jinglesting"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":31,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58232008,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570175195,"creation_date":1570146524,"question_id":58228199,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58228199","body_markdown":"I have a YAML file that describes the content of a text game.

returns\r\n```\r\nworld 0 calculation took 0.0156 sec.\r\nworld 1 calculation took 0.0157 sec.\r\n```\r\nand it seems like there is no speedup whatsoever (I was hoping to see roughly a factor of two speedup). \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an idea what&#39;s going wrong here?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the script:\r\n```\r\nimport numpy as np\r\nfrom mpi4py import MPI\r\nimport

[Yelp Challenge][1], getting the `5 stars` text into a list, doesn&#39;t take that much memory.\r\n  - The Windows resource manager showed an increase of about 1.3GB, but the object size of `text_list` was about 25MB.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport json\r\n\r\ntext_list = list()\r\nwith open(&quot;review.json&quot;, encoding=&quot;utf8&quot;) as f:\r\n    for line in f:\r\n        line =

text, example 2!&#39;]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Extra:\r\n\r\n - Everything after loading the data, seems to require a lot of memory that isn&#39;t being released.\r\n - When cleaning the text, Windows resource manager went up by 16GB, though the final size of `clean_text` was also only about 25MB.\r\n  - Interestingly, deleting `clean_text` does not release the 16GB of memory.\r\n  - In Jupyter Lab, restarting the Kernel will release the memory\r\n  - In PyCharm, stopping the process also releases the memory\r\n  - I tried manually running the garbage collector, but that didn&#39;t release the memory\r\n\r\n### Clean `text_list`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport string\r\n\r\ndef clean_string(value: str) -&gt; list:\r\n    value = value.lower()\r\n    value =

I&#39;m always a fan of a great blowout and no stranger to the chains that offer this service; however, Travis has taken the flawless blowout to a whole new level!  \\n\\nTravis&#39;s greets you with his perfectly green swoosh in his otherwise perfectly styled black hair and a Vegas-worthy rockstar outfit.  Next comes the most relaxing and incredible shampoo -- where you get a full head message that could cure even the very worst migraine in minutes --- and the scented shampoo room.  Travis has freakishly strong fingers (in a good way) and use the perfect amount of pressure.  That was superb!  Then starts the glorious blowout... where not one, not two, but THREE people were involved in doing the best round-brush action my hair has ever seen.  The team of stylists clearly gets along extremely well, as it&#39;s evident from the way they talk to and help one another that it&#39;s really genuine and not some corporate requirement.  It was so much fun to be there! \\n\\nNext Travis started with the flat iron.  The way he flipped his wrist to get volume all around without over-doing it and making me look like a Texas pagent girl was admirable.  It&#39;s also worth noting that he didn&#39;t fry my hair -- something that I&#39;ve had happen before with less skilled stylists.  At the end of the blowout &amp; style my hair was perfectly bouncey and looked terrific.  The only thing better?  That this awesome blowout lasted for days! \\n\\nTravis, I will see you every single time I&#39;m out in Vegas.

I&#39;ve created simple [counter incrementation reproduction](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-context-s73lh).\r\n\r\nThere are two contexts. One for storing state, and the second one for dispatching. It&#39;s a pattern taken from this [article](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).\r\n\r\nThe state context just stores single number and there is only one action that can be invoked on this state:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction reducer(state: State, action: Action): State {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case &quot;inc&quot;: {\r\n      return state + 1;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI also have two helper functions for incrementing value synchronously and asynchronously:\r\n\r\n```\r\nasync function asyncInc(dispatch: React.Dispatch&lt;Action&gt;) {\r\n  await delay(1000);\r\n  dispatch({ type: &quot;inc&quot; });\r\n  dispatch({ type: &quot;inc&quot; });\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction syncInc(dispatch: React.Dispatch&lt;Action&gt;) {\r\n  dispatch({ type: &quot;inc&quot; });\r\n  dispatch({ type: &quot;inc&quot; });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd here is how you use it in the component:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst counter = useCounterState();\r\nconst dispatch = useCounterDispatch();\r\n\r\nreturn (\r\n  &lt;React.Fragment&gt;\r\n    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; asyncInc(dispatch)}&gt;async increment&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; syncInc(dispatch)}&gt;sync increment&lt;/button&gt;\r\n    &lt;div&gt;{counter}&lt;/div&gt;\r\n  &lt;/React.Fragment&gt;\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, when I click the `sync increment` button everything will work as expected. It will invoke the `inc` operation twice, incrementing counter by 2 and perform only one rerender of the component.\r\n\r\nWhen I click the `async increment` button it will first wait for one second and perform `inc` operation twice but it will rerender component twice.\r\n\r\nYou have to open console to see logs from rendering components.\r\n\r\nI kinda understand why is that. When it&#39;s a synchronous operation, everything happens during component rendering, so it will first manipulate state and render at the end. When it&#39;s an asynchronous operation, it will first render component and after one second it will update state once triggering rerender and it will update for the second time triggering next rerender.\r\n\r\nSo is it possible to perform asynchronous state update doing only one rerender?

Any idea of a change in iOS 13 that might cause this behavior?\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Fmpou.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228136/ios-13-uiscrollview-no-longer-scrolls","closed_reason":"duplicate","title":"iOS 13: UIScrollView no longer scrolls"},{"tags":["javascript","css","dom","button","addeventlistener"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11986341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3CsYRgUHysc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3redHOoso_XB9hvgmNU2wqsnBhDCrQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ryan p","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11986341/ryan-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570150075,"post_id":58228371,"comment_id":102831868,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228132/how-to-use-a-button-to-change-the-styles-of-other-buttons/58228371#comment102831868_58228371"},{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11986341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3CsYRgUHysc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3redHOoso_XB9hvgmNU2wqsnBhDCrQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ryan p","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11986341/ryan-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570150742,"post_id":58228371,"comment_id":102831995,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228132/how-to-use-a-button-to-change-the-styles-of-other-buttons/58228371#comment102831995_58228371"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":610,"user_id":10990737,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/796bee99c033e1c130ba3468ea3d9df7?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Ifaruki","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10990737/ifaruki"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570148389,"creation_date":1570148389,"answer_id":58228371,"question_id":58228132,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58228371","body_markdown":"Did you try it with the pseudoclass &quot;:focus&quot; in your ccs styles?\r\nExample:\r\n         \r\n             .button:focus{\r\n                            color: green;\r\n                    }","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228132/how-to-use-a-button-to-change-the-styles-of-other-buttons/58228371#58228371","title":"How to use a button to change the styles of other buttons?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":11986341,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3CsYRgUHysc/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3redHOoso_XB9hvgmNU2wqsnBhDCrQ/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"ryan p","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11986341/ryan-p"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570150382,"post_id":58228460,"comment_id":102831935,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228132/how-to-use-a-button-to-change-the-styles-of-other-buttons/58228460#comment102831935_58228460"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":13,"user_id":3926690,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/0d4885a1e1194ba07dd3506a16867dd1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"ianhobbs","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/3926690/ianhobbs"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570149281,"creation_date":1570149281,"answer_id":58228460,"question_id":58228132,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58228460","body_markdown":"Conceptually your working with a toggle state.

As stated above, it is still **recommended** that you utilize the\r\n&gt; **vuetify-loader** if at all possible. For this install, you will need to\r\n&gt; manually import the Vuetify styles.

However the coverage seems to be executing a line not in the program at all. This is the simple program I am using to test coverage:\r\n\r\n**ConsoleApplication3.cpp**\r\n```\r\n#include &lt;iostream&gt;\r\n\r\nusing namespace std;\r\n\r\nint main()\r\n{\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Running...&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\r\n\tif (false) {\r\n\t\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;shouldn&#39;t print&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n#ifdef _WIN32\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Running in WIN&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n#else\r\n\tcout &lt;&lt; &quot;Running in LIN&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;\r\n#endif \r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nFirst I build using the `/PROFILE` flag (In Solution Explorer, right click the project then `Properties &gt; Linker &gt; Advanced &gt; Profile &gt; set to &quot;Yes (/PROFILE)&quot;`. To run my tests, I just need to execute the `ConsoleApplication3.exe`, so followed the instructions:\r\n\r\n 1. `codecoverage collect /session:qwerty /output:mytest.coverage .\\Debug\\ConsoleApplication3.exe` \r\n 2. `codecoverage shutdown /session:qwerty`\r\n 3. `codecoverage analyze /output:mytestCoverage.xml .\\mytest.coverage`\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE: according to the post I shared above, it is not mentioned that you need to include the `.exe` as an argument. It implied you could start the collecting and then run your tests once collection had started. However, this just left me with an empty report and I found this to actually generate a real report. Next I converted the resulting `mytest.coverage` file to the `.xml` format. Opening up the `mytestCoverage.xml` I see the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n**mytestCoverage.xml**\r\n```\r\n&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;\r\n&lt;results&gt;\r\n   &lt;modules&gt;\r\n      &lt;module lines_not_covered=&quot;1&quot; lines_partially_covered=&quot;0&quot; lines_covered=&quot;6&quot; blocks_not_covered=&quot;3&quot; blocks_covered=&quot;10&quot; line_coverage=&quot;85.71&quot; block_coverage=&quot;76.92&quot; id=&quot;A62F1CFD667E27408B95EED542B0A03801000000&quot; path=&quot;consoleapplication3.exe&quot; name=&quot;consoleapplication3.exe&quot;&gt;\r\n         &lt;functions&gt;\r\n            &lt;function lines_not_covered=&quot;1&quot; lines_partially_covered=&quot;0&quot; lines_covered=&quot;6&quot; blocks_not_covered=&quot;3&quot; blocks_covered=&quot;10&quot; line_coverage=&quot;85.71&quot; block_coverage=&quot;76.92&quot; id=&quot;6832&quot; name=&quot;_main&quot; type_name=&quot;&quot;&gt;\r\n               &lt;ranges&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;6&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;6&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;7&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;7&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;9&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;9&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;10&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;10&quot; covered=&quot;no&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;14&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;14&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;19&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;19&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;\r\n                  &lt;range end_column=&quot;0&quot; end_line=&quot;15732480&quot; start_column=&quot;0&quot; start_line=&quot;15732480&quot; covered=&quot;yes&quot; source_id=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;\r\n               &lt;/ranges&gt;\r\n            &lt;/function&gt;\r\n         &lt;/functions&gt;\r\n         -\r\n         &lt;source_files&gt;\r\n            &lt;source_file id=&quot;0&quot; path=&quot;c:\\users\\sakeeb_hossain\\source\\repos\\consoleapplication3\\consoleapplication3.cpp&quot; checksum=&quot;87CCE2DD760287BB1A6A3CCF2BF8B930&quot; checksum_type=&quot;MD5&quot; /&gt;\r\n         &lt;/source_files&gt;\r\n      &lt;/module&gt;\r\n   &lt;/modules&gt;\r\n&lt;/results&gt;\r\n```\r\nTake a look at the last `&lt;range&gt;` tag.

This can be done pretty simply using Carbon&#39;s `diffInMonths`.

I work for a company that is designing a product in which, due to legal constraints, certain pieces of data need to reside on physical machines in specific geopolitical jurisdictions. For example, some of our data must reside on machines within the borders of the &quot;Vulgarian Federation&quot;.\r\n\r\nWe are using Kubernetes to host the system, and will probably settle on either GKE or AWS as the cloud provider.\r\n\r\nA solution I have invented creates a pod to host a MongoDB instance that is locale specific (say, Vulgaria-MongoDB), which then seamlessly stores the data on physical drives in that locale. My plan is to export the storage from the Vulgarian machine to our Kubernetes cluster using NFS.\r\n\r\nThe problem that I am facing is that I cannot find a secure means of achieving this NFS export. I know that NFSv4 supports Kerberos, but I do not believe that NFS was ever intended to be used over the open web, even with Kerberos.

created a self signed certificate in Azure Key Vault using the following method :\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: c-sharp --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-c-sharp --&gt;\r\n\r\n            public

The only caveat is, I&#39;d like to do it without having to pull the private key out of key vault. Is this even possible? I&#39;ve tried several permutations of the following method.\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- begin snippet: c-sharp --&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- language: lang-c-sharp --&gt;\r\n\r\n            public void CreateSignedCertificate()\r\n            {\r\n                var certPolicy = new CertificatePolicy();\r\n                certPolicy.Attributes = new CertificateAttributes();\r\n                certPolicy.Attributes.NotBefore = DateTime.Now;\r\n                certPolicy.Attributes.Expires = DateTime.Now.AddDays(1);\r\n                certPolicy.IssuerParameters = new IssuerParameters()\r\n                {\r\n                    Name = &quot;CN=testyMcTesterson&quot;\r\n                };\r\n                certPolicy.KeyProperties = new KeyProperties(true);\r\n                certPolicy.SecretProperties = new SecretProperties();\r\n                certPolicy.X509CertificateProperties = new X509CertificateProperties()\r\n                {\r\n                    Subject = &quot;CN=testyJunior&quot;,\r\n                };\r\n                var operation = this.client.CreateCertificateAsync(keyVaultUrl, &quot;testyJunior&quot;, certPolicy);\r\n                operation.Wait();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n&lt;!-- end snippet --&gt;\r\n\r\nThis includes setting the issuer to `&quot;testyMcTesterson&quot;` without `CN=`, setting it to the key vault certificate identifier and the key vault secret. I&#39;d like to set it up so only the .cer file of the signing cert will ever leave key vault. All of these throw a 400 excpetion saying the `IssuerParameters.Name` property is invalid. I realize I&#39;m more than likely missing some EKUs on both the root and the client, but the problem I&#39;m trying to address right now is finding out if this scenario is even feasible. The documentation on the [IssuerParameters][1] class is lacking. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

So the length of the `NUMBERS` array is `(n + m)` words in memory. \r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, with `n = 2` you could have a possible combination for X be the sum of the arbitrary `n = 2` elements 1 + 4, and thus the sum Y of the remaining `m = 3` elements 2 + 3 + 5. You then multiply both sums to get: `X * Y = 5 * 10 = 50`.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother way to put it would be;  \r\nGiven (n + m) signed integers, find the minimum and maximum result of the algebraic expression of the form:\r\n\r\n`(x1 +x2 +x3 +...+xn)*(y1 +y2 +...+ym)`\r\n\r\nfor a fixed given `n`.\r\n\r\n&amp;nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis involves finding all nCr combinations of the set `NUMBERS` where `n` is given, and then finding the sum X for each combination, then calculating the sum Y of the remaining elements not used for the sum X. Then multiplying both. Using the combinatorics nCr formula you can obtain the amount of possible combinations the sum X and the corresponding sum Y, and then brute force every single multiplication to see which will yield the smallest or largest result.\r\n\r\nI am not sure how to proceed, especially since recursion and nested for loops are outside the scope of this first project.\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228082/find-the-min-and-max-with-one-term-being-a-sum-of-an-ncr-combination-of-the-arra","title":"Find the min and max with one term being a

For tickets, if you mean the ones raised by the end users of an organization whenever they encounter an event that interrupts their workflow.\r\n\r\nThen seems you are looking for a helpdesk ticketing system, acts as a documentation of a particular problem, its current status, and other associated information. These tickets are routed to a ticketing software where they are categorized, prioritized, and assigned to different agents according to the organizational norms. \r\n\r\nThe agents then analyze these tickets and suggest appropriate fixes or workarounds and resolve the issue. As a central repository of all these tickets, an IT Ticketing Software helps in providing the context of the issue history and its resolution.\r\n\r\nThen to be honest, this is not what TFS should do. You may have to look for some other system to handle this. \r\n\r\nTFS provides integrated tools to support collaborative software development, including Git repositories, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), and interactive Kanban boards. \r\n\r\nYou could also collect bug/feature request and related info from end users, then track them in TFS.\r\n\r\nBut it&#39;s not suggest to let them directly access your TFS system and fire work items by themselves.

This is because when there is a fresh page load for a url like &lt;code&gt;http://user.github.io/todomvc/todos/42&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;/todos/42&lt;/code&gt; is a frontend route, the GitHub Pages server returns 404 because it knows nothing of &lt;code&gt;/todos/42&lt;/code&gt;.\r\n\r\nIf you want to add a router to a project hosted on GitHub Pages, here are a couple of solutions:\r\n\r\n - You could switch from using HTML5 history API to routing with hashes. If you use React Router, you can switch to hashHistory for this effect, but the URL will be longer and more verbose (for example, http://user.github.io/todomvc/#/todos/42?_k=yknaj) [Read more][1] about different history implementations of react-router.\r\n\r\n\r\nChange your routing from:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n\r\n    &lt;BrowserRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Route render = {({ location }) =&gt; (\r\n         &lt;Layout location = { location }&gt;\r\n             &lt;Switch location = { location }&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route exact path = &#39;/&#39; component = { Home } /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route exact path = &#39;/buttons/&#39; component = { Buttons } /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route component = { NotFound }/&gt;\r\n              &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n           &lt;/Layout&gt;\r\n       )} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;\r\n\r\n```\r\nTo:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { HashRouter, Route, Link } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n\r\n    &lt;HashRouter basename={process.env.PUBLIC_URL}&gt;\r\n      &lt;Route render = {({ location }) =&gt; (\r\n         &lt;Layout location = { location }&gt;\r\n             &lt;Switch location = { location }&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route exact path = &#39;/&#39; component = { Home } /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route exact path = &#39;/buttons/&#39; component = { Buttons } /&gt;\r\n                &lt;Route component = { NotFound }/&gt;\r\n              &lt;/Switch&gt;\r\n           &lt;/Layout&gt;\r\n       )} /&gt;\r\n    &lt;/HashRouter&gt;\r\n...\r\n\r\n```\r\n - Alternatively, you can use a trick to teach GitHub Pages to handle 404 by redirecting to your &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; page with a special redirect parameter. You would need to add a &lt;code&gt;404.html&lt;/code&gt; file with the redirection code to the build folder before deploying your project, and you’ll need to add code handling the redirect parameter to &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;. You can find a detailed explanation of this technique in [this guide][2].\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/api/Router\r\n  [2]: https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58228017/react-router-v4-cant-load-page-on-github-pages/58280415#58280415","title":"React Router v4: Cant load page on GitHub pages"}],"owner":{"reputation":580,"user_id":1019893,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0c00e9f987c3cfaff25903330f06e9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1019893/bill"},"last_editor":{"reputation":580,"user_id":1019893,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":59,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c0c00e9f987c3cfaff25903330f06e9e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Bill","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1019893/bill"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":58,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58280415,"answer_count":1,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570510723,"creation_date":1570144376,"last_edit_date":1570146098,"question_id":58228017,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58228017","body_markdown":"Locally I can browse to /buttons just fine I can even refresh it and its fine too, but when I upload the build directory to github pages I can&#39;t access /buttons and instead I get the GitHub 404 page, not my own &#39;notfound&#39; page.\r\n\r\nIf I make a link from the home page to /buttons, then buttons will load, but browsing there directly it does not load.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport React, { useState } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\nimport { BrowserRouter, Switch, Route } from &#39;react-router-dom&#39;;\r\nimport { Context } from &quot;./components/context&quot;;\r\nimport { Layout } from &quot;./components/layout&quot;;\r\nimport { Home } from &#39;./routes/home&#39;;\r\nimport { Buttons } from &#39;./routes/buttons&#39;;\r\nimport { NotFound } from &#39;./routes/notfound&#39;;\r\n\r\nconst Router: React.FC = () =&gt; {\r\n\r\n  const [global, setGlobal] = useState({\r\n    language: localStorage.getItem(&quot;language&quot;) || &#39;en&#39;,\r\n    apiUrl: &#39;https://api.domain.com/api&#39;,\r\n    loggedIn: localStorage.getItem(&quot;jwt&quot;) ?

I have created an html page for internal use where we can have how-to&#39;s, tutorials, and informational documents available to our employees. I&#39;ve done this by creating a directory on our network `S:/folder/` where I have index.html as well as subfolders where I have put the content pages `S:/folder/subfolder/content.html`. So far everything works fine, I edit `index.html` to add links to new content pages. I would like to incorporate a way for my coworkers to more easily add additional content instead of giving me the content.html page they created, then me needing to add a link and specify the file location, etc. I am brand new to development and so far only have experience in html and css, with limited exposure to javascript/jquery. \r\nMy list of page links looks something like this:\r\n```\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;\r\n  &lt;a href=&quot;../folder/subfolder/content1.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Content 1&lt;/a&gt;\r\n  &lt;a href=&quot;../folder/subfolder/content2.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Content 2&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n```\r\nWhen my coworker creates a new content page, he saves it into `S:/folder/subfolder` and I go to the above container and copy+paste a new entry and manually add the new link. I&#39;ve considered two options to do this automatically:\r\nCould I make an html `&lt;form&gt;` where he can input the file name and the link text and then use jQuery to add an entry to the list using these variables?\r\n```\r\nfunction addLink(url,subfolder,txt) {\r\n  $(&quot;.container&quot;).append(&#39;&lt;a href=&quot;../folder/&#39; + subfolder + &#39;/&#39; + url + &#39;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&#39; + txt + &#39;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt doesn&#39;t seem like this would work as it would only add the link temporarily? Is there a way to do this permanently?\r\n\r\nIf not, I read that php might be needed to handle this form data, but I&#39;m not sure how that would work. Would I be able to run a php script on our offline network? Or would I have to setup a local web server with php and mySQL?\r\n\r\nLike I said, I am new to all of this, so I am open to suggestions.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227993/adding-content-pages-to-local-html-directory-on-offline-network","title":"Adding content pages to local html directory on offline network"},{"tags":["python"],"answers":[{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":3244,"user_id":10824407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/32862a03314e434224acf280c38e6e68?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Olvin Roght","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10824407/olvin-roght"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1570144437,"post_id":58227999,"comment_id":102830772,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227991/can-you-explain-me-to-how-functions-operate/58227999#comment102830772_58227999"},{"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12161797,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mCX5M7W4jxkqlo4Gel79fA2fjqz0XVsJs6w4MxBsg=k-s128=k-s128","display_name":"Cameron jenkins","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12161797/cameron-jenkins"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1570144505,"post_id":58227999,"comment_id":102830787,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58227991/can-you-explain-me-to-how-functions-operate/58227999#comment102830787_58227999"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":208,"user_id":8049126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXVUZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tylerr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8049126/tylerr"},"last_editor":{"reputation":208,"user_id":8049126,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/GXVUZ.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tylerr","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8049126/tylerr"},"comment_count":2,"down_vote_count":4,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":-4,"last_activity_date":1570144943,"last_edit_date":1570144943,"creation_date":1570144234,"answer_id":58227999,"question_id":58227991,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58227999","body_markdown":"Although this is blatantly duplicate, here you go.\r\n\r\n    def function1(): # declares function 2 as printing hello\r\n        print(&quot;hello&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    def function2(): # declares function 2 as printing bye\r\n        print(&quot;bye&quot;)\r\n    \r\n    def function3(): # declares function 3 as returning &quot;Hi again&quot;, which is printed upon it being called.\r\n        return &quot;Hi again&quot;\r\n    \r\n    function1() # will print hello\r\n    function2() # will print bye\r\n    \r\n    print(function3()) # will return the value &quot;Hi again&quot;

`BEGIN{OFS=&quot;,&quot;}` tells awk how  to outuput the line. \r\n - The `for` statement uses NF, the built in internal variable for the \r\nnumber of fields for each line\r\n - The substr divide and change the first letter of the field, and it&#39;s assigned to its line value again\r\n - All row is printed `print $0`\r\n - Finally, the second `awk` divides the lines created on the first example, but this time dividing with spaces as separator. This way, It detects all different words on the file, and changes every first Character of them.\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nHope it helps\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

have a number of Raspberry Pi cameras focused on bird feeders, \r\ncontinually running a TensorFlow Object Detection graph (SSD MNet2) to detect birds. \r\nOver time I&#39;ve built a dataset of +10k image over 11 species, retraining the graph frequently.\r\nI intend to cap the number of items in the dataset to 10k items (perhaps arbitrarily).\r\n\r\nThere is a flow of data through the dataset so that it continually improves.\r\nNew candidate detections are triaged by a judge (me) as follows:\r\n\r\n  - Add as new training/evaluation item.\r\n    The detection is judged representative of a category.\r\n    After adjustment, the image and detection can be added to the ground truth\r\n        \r\n  - Add as counter example item.\r\n    The detection is false, but can be converted to an unclassified counter example.\r\n    After adjustment, the image and detection can be added to the ground truth\r\n    \r\n  - Discard item\r\n    Not useful for training.\r\n\r\nAlso note that some existing data is retired when sufficient better data is available.\r\n\r\nTo date, all the items in the ground truth are delivered to training with a weight of 1.0.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/data_decoders/tf_example_decoder.py\r\n```\r\n    def default_groundtruth_weights():\r\n      return tf.ones(\r\n          [tf.shape(tensor_dict[fields.InputDataFields.groundtruth_boxes])[0]],\r\n          dtype=tf.float32)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is obviously not very true. \r\nI know by inspection that some of the items are not so good, but at any one time they&#39;re the best examples available.\r\nOver time, eventually, bad items get replaced with better items.\r\n\r\n### Ranked training records\r\nI have wondered about the impact on training and whether the situation would be improved by ranking the dataset, by some value of ideality, \r\nand then training in successive ranks, so that the model initialises on the most ideal data and subsequently learns less and less ideal data.\r\n\r\nWhat I&#39;m imagining trying to avoid is the model paying too much attention to `bad` data and not enough to `good` data, especially during the initial epochs of training.\r\nWhere `bad` and `good` data mean how well the data items contribute to the veracity and visualization (via Lucid) of the trained models.\r\n\r\n### Weighted Dataset\r\nSetting a weight (between 0 and 1) on an item means the loss calculated for that item is reduced (by the weight factor); \r\nI assume it means &quot;pay less attention to this item by this much&quot;.\r\n\r\nSee: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51862997/class-weights-for-balancing-data-in-tensorflow-object-detection-api\r\n \r\nI&#39;ve visited every item in my dataset to retrospectively set a weight.\r\nI did this by running some recent models over the dataset images (admittedly, from which the models were trained) and then matching detections.\r\nThe weight given to each item was calculated by averaging scores from the model detections (and rounding to one decimal place to make bands).\r\nThe entire dataset was then reviewed to increase or reduce weights as judged necessary.\r\n\r\nThe results are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n    | Class\\Weight Bin | 0.3 | 0.4 | 0.5 | 0.6 | 0.7 | 0.8 | 0.9 | Total| \r\n    | blackbird        |     |     |  34 |
