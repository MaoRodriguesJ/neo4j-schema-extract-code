It should be useful to check these:\r\n\r\n- [Troubleshooting your Pipeline](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/troubleshooting-your-pipeline)\r\n- [Common error guidance](https://cloud.google.com/dataflow/docs/guides/common-errors)\r\n\r\nIf these resources don&#39;t help, I&#39;ll try to summarize some reasons why your job may be stuck, and how you can debug it. I&#39;ll separate these issues depending on which part of the system is causing the trouble. Your job may be:\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Job stuck at startup\r\n\r\nA job can get stuck being received by the Dataflow service, or starting up new Dataflow workers. Some risk factors for this are:\r\n\r\n- Did you add a custom `setup.py` file?\r\n- Do you have any dependencies that require a special setup on worker startup?\r\n- Are you manipulating the worker container?\r\n\r\n**To debug this sort of issue** I usually open StackDriver logging, and look for `worker-startup` logs (see next figure). These logs are written by the worker as it starts up a docker container with your code, and your dependencies. If you see any problem here, it would indicate an issue with your `setup.py`, your job submission, staged artifacts, etc.\r\n\r\n[![worker-startup logs][1]][1]\r\n\r\nAnother thing you can do is to keep the same setup, and run a very small pipeline that stages everything:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwith beam.Pipeline(...) as p:\r\n  (p \r\n   | beam.Create([&#39;test element&#39;]) \r\n   | beam.Map(lambda x: logging.info(x)))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don&#39;t see your logs in StackDriver, then you can continue to debug your setup. **If you do see the log** in StackDriver, then your job may be stuck somewhere else.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Job *seems* stuck in user code\r\n\r\nSomething else that could happen is that your job is performing some operation in user code that is **stuck or slow**. Some risk factors for this are:\r\n\r\n- Is your job performing operations that require you to wait for them? (e.g. loading data to an external service, waiting for promises/futures)\r\n  - Note that some of the builtin transforms of Beam do exactly this (e.g. the Beam IOs like BigQueryIO, FileIO, etc).\r\n- Is your job loading very large side inputs into memory? This may happen if you are using `View.AsList` for a side input.\r\n- Is your job loading very large iterables after `GroupByKey` operations?\r\n\r\n**A symptom** of this kind of issue can be that the pipeline&#39;s throughput is lower than you would expect. **Another symptom** is seeing the following line in the logs:\r\n\r\n```\r\nProcessing stuck in step &lt;STEP_NAME&gt;/&lt;...&gt;/&lt;...&gt; for at least &lt;TIME&gt; without outputting or completing in state &lt;STATE&gt;\r\n    .... &lt;a stacktrace&gt; ....\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn cases like these it makes sense to look at which step is consuming the most time in your pipeline, and inspect the code for that step, to see what may be the problem.\r\n\r\n[![expensive transform identified!][2]][2]\r\n\r\nSome tips:\r\n\r\n- Very large side inputs can be troublesome, so if your pipeline relies on accessing a very large side input, you may need to redesign it to avoid that bottleneck.\r\n\r\n- It is possible to have asynchronous requests to external services, but I recommend that you commit / finalize work on `startBundle` and `finishBundle` calls.\r\n\r\n- If your pipeline&#39;s throughput is not what you would normally expect, it may be because you don&#39;t have enough parallelism. This can be fixed by a `Reshuffle`, or by sharding your existing keys into subkeys (Beam often does processing per-key, and so if you have too few keys, your parallelism will be low) - or using a `Combiner` instead of `GroupByKey` + `ParDo`.\r\n\r\n- Another reason that your throughput is low may be that your job is waiting too long on external calls. You can try addressing this by trying out batching strategies, or async IO.\r\n\r\nIn general, there&#39;s no silver bullet to improve your pipeline&#39;s throughput,and you&#39;ll need to have experimentation.\r\n\r\n---\r\n### The data freshness or system lag are increasing\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I&#39;d recommend you check out [this presentation on watermarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWxSLmkWPm4).\r\n\r\nFor streaming, the advance of the watermarks is what drives the pipeline to make progress, thus, it is important to be watchful of things that could cause the watermark to be held back, and stall your pipeline downstream. Some reasons why the watermark may become stuck:\r\n\r\n- One possibility is that your pipeline is hitting an unresolvable error condition. **When a bundle fails processing, your pipeline will continue to attempt to execute that bundle indefinitely**, and this will hold the watermark back.\r\n  - When this happens, **you will see errors in your Dataflow console**, and the count will keep climbing as the bundle is retried. See:\r\n\r\n[![enter image description here][3]][3]\r\n\r\n- You may have a bug when associating the timestamps to your data. Make sure that the resolution of your timestamp data is the correct one!\r\n- Although unlikely, it is possible that you&#39;ve hit a bug in Dataflow. If neither of the other tips helps, please open a support ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/0lC8C.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/mLtbo.png\r\n  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/Qpnhi.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110450/how-can-i-debug-why-my-dataflow-job-is-stuck/58110451#58110451","title":"How can I debug why my Dataflow job is stuck?"}],"owner":{"reputation":4711,"user_id":1255356,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":84,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/LSG5g.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Pablo","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1255356/pablo"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":37,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58110451,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569605128,"creation_date":1569477729,"question_id":58110450,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110450","body_markdown":"I have a Dataflow job that is not making progress - or it is making very slow progress, and I do not know why.

smart! The first comparison with 24 is to do a rough range check - if it&#39;s more than 24 or less than 0 it will bail out; this is important as the instructions that follow that operate on the magic number have a hard cap to [0, 31] for operand range. \r\n\r\nFor the rest, the magic number is just a bitmask, with the bits corresponding to the &quot;good&quot; values set.\r\n\r\n    &gt;&gt;&gt; bin(20078725)\r\n    &#39;0b1001100100110000010000101&#39;\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s easy to spot the first and third bits (counting from 1 and from right) set, the 8th, 14th, 15th, ... \r\n\r\nMSVC checks it &quot;directly&quot; using the BT (bit test) instruction and branching, clang instead shifts it of the appropriate amount (to get the relevant bit in the lowest order position) and keeps just it ANDing it with zero (avoiding a branch).\r\n\r\nThe C code corresponding to the clang version would be something like:\r\n\r\n    bool MyFunction(MyEnum e) {\r\n        if(unsigned(e) &gt; 24) return false;\r\n        return (20078725 &gt;&gt; e) &amp; 1;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nas for the MSVC version, it&#39;s more like\r\n\r\n    inline bool bit_test(unsigned val, int bit) {\r\n        return val &amp; (1&lt;&lt;bit);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    bool MyFunction(MyEnum e) {\r\n        if(unsigned(e) &gt; 24) return false;\r\n        return bit_test(20078725, e);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n(I kept the `bit_test` function separated to emphasize that it&#39;s actually a single instruction in assembly, that `val &amp; (1&lt;&lt;bit)` thing has no correspondence to the original assembly.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the `if`-based code, it&#39;s quite bad - it uses a lot of CMOV and ORs the results together, which is both longer code, and will probably serialize execution. I suspect the corresponding clang code will be better. OTOH, you wrote this code using bitwise OR (`|`) instead of the more semantically correct logical OR (`||`), and the compiler is strictly following your orders (typical of MSVC).\r\n\r\nAnother possibility to try instead could be a `switch` - but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much to gain compared to the code already generated for the first snippet, which looks pretty good to me. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOk, doing [a quick test with all the versions against all compilers][1], we can see that:\r\n\r\n- the C translation of the CLang output above results in pretty much that same code (= to the clang output) in all compilers; similarly for the MSVC translation;\r\n- the bitwise or version is the same as the logical or version (= good) in both CLang and gcc;\r\n- in general, gcc does essentially the same thing as CLang except for the `switch` case;\r\n- `switch` results are varied:\r\n    - CLang does best, by generating the exact same code;\r\n    - both gcc and MSVC generate jump-table based code, which in this case is less good; however:\r\n        - gcc prefers to emit a table of QWORDs, trading size for simplicity of the setup code;\r\n        - MSVC instead emits a table of BYTEs, paying it in setup code size; I couldn&#39;t get gcc to emit similar code even changing -O3 to -Os (optimize for size).\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://gcc.godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAKxAEZSAbAQwDtRkBSAJgCFufSAZ1QBXYskwgA5JhYiAtgGoAsgE9scpRwDsfAAwBBRccUaCxVfQ6GTpludVdS1oybMWAzM5tv7FgCzersbuqgCsQbahAGyRvg7acSF%2BqgAcSXYOAJwZobR6uSm0Vj7JDrROLlFFXlXxFrSBdWUNEc2ZDbHteYndRel95TmDFlwFI44lwR2OlaUzXLXzoVxNyylcbesOXF3bo737jgNHXFkuOgAiHB76Bi4A9A%2BKAMrmTHjACASKAMKK7xYgmYBDwqBYilQADMAQhMIpkMw2ABaVAAB1B8jwAC9MOhISICGjCS4AEaoVAMRTyJjAPDIAD6iNYwAgag0CkUmAAlIodHdbHgoRAREDPiw8RAeXyPNhFKtecRMAQxBCoUwGIJMDcBSYlSriBCIGM9NpUtpNjLsDc5dLuNFFLQdRdtNdDI9nhACAg8IJFIIEKIGPjSZg0PJ4UxFKSfnggeYRMhQeDFAB3OEQuMMON47kuQQEJig5CKLM56MUqmkwgMgiYAsisXACX4gBuGtIpfs0cIvP57X1qsU7ap9sUECdHl%2BN1%2B1YIeduLrd90MT1e70%2B3z%2BAOIrGBRbBEOhsPhyheADVfqiMXgsbj8aIiSTDOTKdTafSGfJBK3kGz1JoXJ9ro7RCo2gjipKdqyvK/iKsqQ7qpq2qLvMg6Gj2BC1vWBDGnoprmpsnY8s67quhcq7PEKfK8IoDCoHSyAaqixDRkwWr4mgWBkpWdEMfSGoMiQ/4ckoJFkbqxjURA7Twjc1weJcKgAQoIAgHkfLaNOWl8vMcmKfJymiWpoQeJp2n/LJMoKUp7KaCZKSpOZOiWXp1mGXZqnqUU/jOTpVnyR5KnyA55RhH505uYFilGfZ3nlE5LlJVFBkxZ5IXxaMtARbp0z6TZsVeSsXARQFqW2cFoWjGEebzP28y2OhEIJihkmacujUIRhSFaqR9zke6lGljC/CYamvqYCxbEcQiGDai%2BvFzuNWpCcQImAeJ/VtdJ7RSu5aWVZlljAZF0x7dFFXGUdHgnbltjneVhUZaEqS3bt%2BVBVdeRweZd0mA9BXpVVlg1c58wA59cV5K9YNnR9B1fRstBveD8OXVDGxcCd737ejRUbDVtXTPV0ydQazXECIrXtFcA5dWqGq9ah/XLh6/rjQQyAIMipLsXis3cQtb6CBzXMMutnJ2iB8wi4QXNSsBbVMVqT3A7QIDtMrp6HaZGvzFrqtHakevTAbQNHY0Ju2GbOtFGEVsmDbiMJQ7xhOxjOzq5rfOG8VrsIj75srPb7Rk0OLV9bYWDqiIDAEP7YfdYz1N1QNLNSNyjDSGEUikCw0h6LnqDSNOvCjcIYgSDRHi0Ln8dSIX3KZwA1iAuwAHTaNoWRZGc/iNHoYRhLQ0SBAw0j%2BLn%2BcN0X0i54IIAFPXjekHAsBIOGaJ4AwmBkBQECb9vu8gMAvekFC291sQC8QKSBe59WLBMBY0i16Q4YRvYADyLAMKo9%2BkCwDSNgO8AH4CVEmPArZ6wAMwAADzDISSQM9yD2EwOPFB2ZSS7gsL8Oar867EFvAQzOSJ2D8H4IwPApIF6QEzuiZMQJpDIi/mZZEAB1DUVIOHwPePPUQ4hJDIyzlIHOecAHFykHA1I0RkSj0UMAZAJYsjtxKhAXAhASDV3oH8VA8gt471YtwGuvJS58F4HXe%2BTdSCt0WKok02hB6pDCFkfw/hUj%2BC8Bgye4iUGSPnovUgy8M6rxgIgFAeiDG73IJQQ%2BhiUBkKyPhc%2Bl9d43zvigx%2Bz9/5SDfh/WQBAf5/zAZgYBwBQEoPAWGUE0CF4oPgYgusBDUF1gwYXKh2Dsl4KwM08wxDckhLISgChvAOm0IgPQm84I6ksI8PwyuQjSHZynhI6Q0jZHyOZGwRQKi9Dtz0OODRRAjGLB0Xg/RR8TkeCxn8EZPBLEz2sbY/w7ce5vPeR82I3iVl%2BLnkIQJwTM5r3CXE6J%2B9QXEBAL%2BNEaIGStloFkBkXAuAMjgaPFJcc0mUAye0rJL8Bnvz0Z/Qpv8cntKASyCp5K8AQJqTA%2BpCDkBIOaXGVpACsE4NUN05Bb8%2BkhQGaQlkwyy6jKweMyZjCF4PC/k4Cugi6BLNET89pki0W%2BW/L%2BYcCL7GHPwMc7RnZzlRKuTdW5Ir7lBKsS3NuERvm%2BJVX8heS8rUiK4Mq2eUgHmN0ztA6%2Bh4QD%2BCAA%3D%3D%3D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110400/what-is-the-compiler-doing-here-that-allows-comparison-of-many-values-to-be-done/58110464#58110464","title":"What is the compiler doing here that allows comparison of many values to be done with few actual comparisons?"},{"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"edited":false,"score":2,"creation_date":1569494451,"post_id":58115005,"comment_id":102619230,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110400/what-is-the-compiler-doing-here-that-allows-comparison-of-many-values-to-be-done/58115005#comment102619230_58115005"}],"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":4,"is_accepted":false,"score":4,"last_activity_date":1569495979,"last_edit_date":1569495979,"creation_date":1569494390,"answer_id":58115005,"question_id":58110400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58115005","body_markdown":"**Ah, the old immediate bitmap trick.**\r\n\r\nGCC does this too, at least for a switch. \r\n https://stackoverflow.com/q/47779014.  Unfortunately GCC9 has a regression for some cases: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=91026#c3 ; GCC8 and earlier do a better job.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother example of using it, this time for code-golf (fewest bytes of code, in this case x86 machine code) to detect certain letters: [User Appreciation Challenge #1: Dennis ♦][1]\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The basic idea is to use the input as an index into a bitmap of true/false results.**\r\n\r\nFirst you have to range-check because the bitmap is fixed-width, and x86 shifts wrap the shift count.  We don&#39;t want high inputs to alias into the range where there are some that should return true.  `cmp edi, 24`/`ja` is doing.\r\n\r\n(If the range between the lowest and highest `true` values was from 120 to 140, for example, it might start with a `sub edi,120` to range-shift everything before the `cmp`.)\r\n\r\nThen you use `bitmap &amp; (1&lt;&lt;e)` ([the `bt` instruction][2]), or `(bitmap &gt;&gt; e) &amp; 1` (`shr` / `and`) to check the bit in the bitmap that tells you whether that `e` value should return true or false.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to implement that check, logically equivalent but with performance differences.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nIf the range was wider than 32, it would have to use 64-bit operand-size.  If it was wider than 64, the compiler might not attempt this optimization at all.  Or might still do it for some of the conditions that are in a narrow range.\r\n\r\nUsing an even larger bitmap (in .rodata memory) would be possible but probably not something most compilers will invent for you.  Either with `bt [mem],reg` (inefficient) or manually indexing a dword and checking that the same way this code checks the immediate bitmap.  If you had a lot of high-entropy ranges it might be worth checking 2x 64-bit immediate bitmap, branchy or branchless...\r\n\r\n\r\n**Clang/LLVM has other tricks up its sleeve for efficiently comparing against multiple values** (when it doesn&#39;t matter which one is hit), e.g. broadcast a value into a SIMD register and use a packed compare.  That isn&#39;t dependent on the values being in a dense range.  (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58069614/clang-generates-worse-code-for-7-comparisons-than-for-8-comparisons)\r\n\r\n&gt;  that optimizes the code way more than what I would think is possible.\r\n\r\nThese kinds of optimizations come from smart human compiler developers that notice common patterns in source code and think of clever ways to implement them.  Then get compilers to recognize those patterns and transform their internal representation of the program logic to use the trick.\r\n\r\nTurns out that `switch` and switch-like `if()` statements are common, and aggressive optimizations are common.\r\n\r\nCompilers are *far* from perfect, but sometimes they do come close to living up to what people often claim; that compilers will optimize your code for you so you can write it in a human-readable way and still have it run near-optimally.  This is sometimes true over the small scale.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n&gt; Since I do not understand what happens in the first case, I can not really judge which one is more efficient in my case.\r\n\r\n**The immediate bitmap is *vastly* more efficient**.  There&#39;s no data memory access in either one so no cache miss loads.  The only &quot;expensive&quot; instruction is a variable-count shift (3 uops on mainstream Intel, because of x86&#39;s annoying FLAGS-setting semantics; BMI2 `shrx` is only 1 uop and avoid having to `mov` the number to `ecx`.)  https://agner.org/optimize.  And see other performance analysis links in https://stackoverflow.com/tags/x86/info.\r\n\r\nEach instruction in the cmp/cmov chain is at least 1 uop, and there&#39;s a pretty long dependency chain through each `cmov` because MSVC didn&#39;t bother to break it into 2 or more parallel chains.  But regardless it&#39;s just a lot of uops, far more than the bitmap version, so worse for throughput (ability for out-of-order exec to overlap the work with surrounding code) as well as latency.\r\n\r\n`bt` is also cheap: 1 uop on modern AMD and Intel.  (`bts`, `btr`, `btc` are 2 on AMD, still 1 on Intel).\r\n\r\nThe branch in the immediate-bitmap version could have been a `setna` / `and` to make it branchless, but especially for this enum definition the compiler expected that it would be in range.  It could have increased branch predictability by only requiring `e &lt;= 31`, not `e &lt;= 24`.\r\n\r\nSince the `enum` only goes up to 29, and IIRC it&#39;s UB to have out-of-range enum values, it could actually optimize it away entirely.\r\n\r\nEven if the `e&gt;24` branch doesn&#39;t predict very well, it&#39;s still probably better overall.  Given current compilers, we only get a choice between the nasty chain of cmp/cmov or branch + bitmap.  Unless turn the asm logic back into C to hand-hold compilers into making the asm we want, then we can maybe get branchless with an AND or CMOV to make it always zero for out-of-range `e`.\r\n\r\nBut if we&#39;re lucky, profile-guided optimization might let some compilers make the bitmap range check branchless.  (In asm the behaviour of `shl reg, cl` with cl &gt; 31 or 63 is well-defined: on x86 it simply masks the count.  In a C equivalent, you could use `bitmap &gt;&gt; (e&amp;31)` which can still optimize to a `shr`; compilers know that x86 shr masks the count so they can optimize that away.  But not for other ISAs that saturate the shift count...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere are lots of ways to implement the bitmap check that are pretty much equivalent.  e.g. you could even use the CF output of `shr`, set according to the last bit shifted out.  At least if you make sure CF has a known state ahead of time for the `cl=0` case.\r\n\r\nWhen you want an integer `bool` result, right-shifting seems to make more sense than `bt` / `setcc`, **but with `shr` costing 3 uops on Intel it might actually be best to use `bt reg,reg` / `setc al`.**  Especially if you only need a `bool`, and can use EAX as your bitmap destination so the previous value of EAX is definitely ready before `setcc`.  (Avoiding a false dependency on some unrelated earlier dep chain.)\r\n\r\nBTW, MSVC has other silliness: as https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33666617/what-is-the-best-way-to-set-a-register-to-zero-in-x86-assembly-xor-mov-or-and explains, `xor al,al` is totally stupid compared to `xor eax,eax` when you want to zero AL.  If you don&#39;t need to leave the upper bytes of RAX unmodified, zero the full register with a zeroing idiom.\r\n\r\nAnd of course branching just to return 0 or return 1 makes little sense, unless you expect it to be very predictable and want to break the data dependency.  I&#39;d expect that `setc al` would make more sense to read the CF result of `bt`\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/a/123458\r\n  [2]: https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/bt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110400/what-is-the-compiler-doing-here-that-allows-comparison-of-many-values-to-be-done/58115005#58115005","title":"What is the compiler doing here that allows comparison of many values to be done with few actual comparisons?"}],"owner":{"reputation":534,"user_id":9591796,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9e576be541e38ec194bf927573cbed63?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"JohnAl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9591796/johnal"},"last_editor":{"reputation":162392,"user_id":224132,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/N4ivW.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Peter Cordes","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/224132/peter-cordes"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":139,"favorite_count":3,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"accepted_answer_id":58110464,"answer_count":2,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569495979,"creation_date":1569477432,"last_edit_date":1569485537,"question_id":58110400,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110400","body_markdown":"My question is about what the compiler is doing in this case that optimizes the code way more than what I would think is possible. \r\n\r\nGiven this enum:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nenum MyEnum {\r\n    Entry1,\r\n    Entry2,\r\n    ...   // Entry3..27 are the same, omitted for size.\r\n    Entry28,\r\n    Entry29\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd this function:\r\n\r\n```c++\r\nbool MyFunction(MyEnum e)\r\n{\r\n    if (\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry1 || \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry3 || \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry8 || \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry14 || \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry15 ||\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry18 ||\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry21 || \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry22 ||\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry25)\r\n    {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the function, MSVC generates this assembly when compiled with -Ox optimization flag ([Godbolt][1]):\r\n\r\n```assembly\r\nbool MyFunction(MyEnum) PROC                  ; MyFunction\r\n        cmp     ecx, 24\r\n        ja      SHORT $LN5@MyFunction\r\n        mov     eax, 20078725                   ; 01326085H\r\n        bt      eax, ecx\r\n        jae     SHORT $LN5@MyFunction\r\n        mov     al, 1\r\n        ret     0\r\n$LN5@MyFunction:\r\n        xor     al, al\r\n        ret     0\r\n```\r\n\r\nClang generates similar (slightly better, one less jump) assembly when compiled with -O3 flag:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyFunction(MyEnum):                  # @MyFunction(MyEnum)\r\n        cmp     edi, 24\r\n        ja      .LBB0_2\r\n        mov     eax, 20078725\r\n        mov     ecx, edi\r\n        shr     eax, cl\r\n        and     al, 1\r\n        ret\r\n.LBB0_2:\r\n        xor     eax, eax\r\n        ret\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat is happening here?

I do not understand what is happening here.\r\n\r\nThe reason why I am looking at this is that I was wondering if it is good to write the function as above, or alternatively like this, with bitwise comparisons:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\nbool MyFunction2(MyEnum e)\r\n{\r\n    if (\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry1 | \r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry3 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry8 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry14 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry15 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry18 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry21 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry22 |\r\n    e == MyEnum::Entry25)\r\n    {\r\n        return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis results in this generated assembly with MSVC:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbool MyFunction2(MyEnum) PROC           ; MyFunction2\r\n        xor     edx, edx\r\n        mov     r9d, 1\r\n        cmp     ecx, 24\r\n        mov     eax, edx\r\n        mov     r8d, edx\r\n        sete    r8b\r\n        cmp     ecx, 21\r\n        sete    al\r\n        or      r8d, eax\r\n        mov     eax, edx\r\n        cmp     ecx, 20\r\n        cmove   r8d, r9d\r\n        cmp     ecx, 17\r\n        sete    al\r\n        or      r8d, eax\r\n        mov     eax, edx\r\n        cmp     ecx, 14\r\n        cmove   r8d, r9d\r\n        cmp     ecx, 13\r\n        sete    al\r\n        or      r8d, eax\r\n        cmp     ecx, 7\r\n        cmove   r8d, r9d\r\n        cmp     ecx, 2\r\n        sete    dl\r\n        or      r8d, edx\r\n        test    ecx, ecx\r\n        cmove   r8d, r9d\r\n        test    r8d, r8d\r\n        setne   al\r\n        ret     0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I do not understand what happens in the first case, I can not really judge which one is more efficient in my case.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://godbolt.org/#z:OYLghAFBqd5QCxAYwPYBMCmBRdBLAF1QCcAaPECAKxAEZSAbAQwDtRkBSAJgCFufSAZ1QBXYskwgA5JhYiAtgGoAsgE9scpRwDsfAAwBBRccUaCxVfQ6GTpludVdS1oybMWAzM5tv7FgCzersbuqgCsQbahAGyRvg7acSF%2BqgAcSXYOAJwZobR6uSm0Vj7JDrROLlFFXlXxFrSBdWUNEc2ZDbHteYndRel95TmDFlwFI44lwR2OlaUzXLXzoVxNyylcbesOXF3bo737jgNHXFkuOgAiHB76Bi4ARqioDCqqAGIiLMgEeKgsEDUGgUikwAEoLrp2ngAGaKCDtTCKG7XDyXN7A%2BQgEB5ZHaADCOnxyPmSJRKIxmmxoQ8eMJBJJ0zJaIpQKpOJSqTpRMZtmZqPRbIU1KK/m5DMRyJZaMpwo55TC4sJpKlAtlWPlDS5RJ1KvJMqFGpWtCVvJM/NZ6nZKy4Ssl%2BsFVrlKzCEPmOjutlsxEwBDELEU5hEmBunpMV3aPr9xADMKYDEEIdukOuhkez1eak%2B31%2B/y4gKdSnBkLDxlh8Pt0sdmJF5TpZuMFoNhdrnm5eqr6tbaXbTNVlprmssYt1fYdXaHtEVo75/ebg7y2oJlbVhu7XBNM/Nc%2Br1o2tq3jZ3E5dbumHva3t9/sDxGDofaEfmUZvcYTSbuVykYMY0jCUlIFhpD0ADUGkQleH4RRhDECRkUWWgAIIYDvx/ABrEAPA8AA6LC8PwgjYgYaR/AAoCpBA0gwKkADBBAApkIo79SDgWAkDQeQAAc8AYTAyAoCAOO43jiBQZg2CyPQChhHiCD4uiIAeFDSAePAWCYCxpEQ0gOPkWQCAAeRYBhVGUrB5FYYBeLMvAfR%2BPAADdMDopjSEwAAPTBkBEOStIAtS5OI1yGDwB5iA01R8QwSQpG08w8CxWLmPE9h%2BH4RhQroyAf1QTjcxYFyAFoDI8WjRHESRaB/IL/0A5TqPc1JokK6IxWQFLFCybC9G6%2BFcEIEh4I8ehFCirieL4oaqtGtLeCQlCwXQzCcII1a8KIkiyPq6RaPo0hGJAn9WMQFBUHGkTyEoISJtEhzkE4ziAH0HNoLJHq4LhHvc1rSBkhg5OIBSlNc1T1M0pKdLOvT7CMkyzMwCy2Gs1z8Ds34nJcyiPK8nyYu0gLMCCyiQrCiKoqwPz9uIBK/OqyyUFmgQSayiAcryv4CukYr3LK2DKuqv8ttchrWsUeRBDuxQXq6j6%2BvwIhiCm0hRrO4TJu4DwuDBGbILm/aFqWrDcLW1bfykUi6uFnahD2g7ULNrghco6j5qYxbSCcwGOZAfwgA%3D%3D%3D","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110400/what-is-the-compiler-doing-here-that-allows-comparison-of-many-values-to-be-done","title":"What is the compiler doing here that allows comparison of many values to be done with few actual comparisons?"},{"tags":["c#","asp.net","asp.net-mvc","linq"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":1155,"user_id":2122217,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":22,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/49a4ac24bbb6d7f0ecaa68cfa110cb1c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Gabriel Llorico","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2122217/gabriel-llorico"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1569483579,"post_id":58110395,"comment_id":102613483,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110395/get-unique-users-per-hour-day-month#comment102613483_58110395"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":146,"user_id":11605410,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fed2ff9abd025488a1f376f07da312a9?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"TheMikeInNYC","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11605410/themikeinnyc"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":true,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569529006,"creation_date":1569529006,"answer_id":58124170,"question_id":58110395,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58124170","body_markdown":"You can group by multiple fields by passing in an anonymous object like this\r\n\r\n```\r\nViewBag.monthArray= db.Conversation.ToList().GroupBy(p =&gt; new { DateTime.Parse(p.Date_Time).Month, p.UserID })\r\n                .ToArray();\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nif you inspect that result, you can see what else you can do.

- there is no way to achieve what you are looking for using the above separate-middlware-for-each-type method. Each middleware prematurely redirects [either to `/dashboard` or to `/expert` etc] the request without allowing it to passthrough other middleware. Best would be to use a third-party package that provides a more comprehensive and fine-grained access control [example: https://github.com/Zizaco/entrust]\r\n\r\nIf that&#39;s not an option, the best case would be to implement a single middleware and pass the role as parameter. See: [Laravel Middleware Parameters][1]\r\n\r\nA minimal example would look like:\r\n\r\n    public function handle($request, Closure $next, $role)\r\n    {\r\n        // Assuming Auth::check() passes\r\n        $roleId = auth()-&gt;user()-&gt;role_id;\r\n        \r\n        if ($roleId == 2 &amp;&amp; strpos($role, &#39;expert&#39;) !== false) {\r\n            // Logged in user is `expert` and route allows `expert` access\r\n            return $next($request);\r\n        } else if ($roleId == 3 &amp;&amp; strpos($role, &#39;user&#39;) !== false) {\r\n            // Logged in user is `user` and route allows `user` access\r\n            return $next($request);\r\n        } // and so on...\r\n\r\n        // Handle failures here\r\n        if ($roleId == 2 &amp;&amp; strpos($role, &#39;expert&#39;) === false) {\r\n           // an `expert` is trying to access route that can&#39;t be accessed\r\n           return redirect(&#39;/expert-dashboard&#39;);\r\n        } // and so on...\r\n    }\r\n\r\nYou&#39;d define routes as:\r\n\r\n    Route::group([&#39;middleware&#39;

If we take a look at the implementation:\r\n\r\n    replicate&#39; :: (Num i, Ord i) =&gt; i -&gt; a -&gt; [a]  \r\n    replicate&#39; n x  \r\n        | n &lt;= 0    = []  \r\n        | otherwise = x:replicate&#39; (n-1) x\r\n\r\nWe see that the `(&lt;=) :: Ord a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; Bool` function is applied to `n`, and we calculate `n-1` in the recursion (with `(-) :: Num a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a`). The most generic type signature thus will add a `Num` and `Ord` type constraint on that number.\r\n\r\nWe thus can call `replicate&#39; 3.1415 1`, and it will return the first four items. But it is probably nonsensical to do that.\r\n\r\nThe `Integral` typeclass is a typeclass for integral numbers. It supports integer division. Any `Integral` type must be a member of the `Real` and `Enum` typeclass.\r\n\r\nA type that is a member of the `Real` typeclass, should support a function `toRational :: Real a =&gt; a -&gt; Rational` to convert that number to a `Rational`, and furthermore should be a member of the `Num` and `Ord` typeclasses.\r\n\r\nThis thus means that if a type is a member of the `Integral` typeclass, it is a member of `Num`, `Enum`, `Ord` and `Real` as well. You thus made the type more *restrictive*. But I think in the context of a `replicate&#39;` it makes perfect sense to do that.\r\n\r\nNote that it might *not* be ideal to write:\r\n\r\n    replicate&#39; :: (Num a, Ord a) =&gt; a -&gt; b -&gt; [b]\r\n    replicate&#39; 0 x = []\r\n    replicate&#39; n x = x:replicate&#39; (n-1) x\r\n\r\nIn case we here call `replicate (-3) 1`, or `replicate 3.14 1` (as [@leftroundabout pointed out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110296/haskell-difference-between-num-a-ord-a-integral-a/58111467?noredirect=1#comment102629639_58111467)), we will obtain an infinite list of `1`s.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110296/haskell-difference-between-num-a-ord-a-integral-a/58111467#58111467","title":"Haskell: Difference between (Num a, Ord a) &amp; (Integral a)"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10848902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35da153b0a61f3bc40568961c82ce826?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthikeyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10848902/karthikeyan"},"last_editor":{"reputation":16,"user_id":10848902,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/35da153b0a61f3bc40568961c82ce826?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Karthikeyan","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/10848902/karthikeyan"},"comment_count":4,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":97,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":3,"answer_count":1,"score":3,"last_activity_date":1569568865,"creation_date":1569476839,"last_edit_date":1569562902,"question_id":58110296,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110296","body_markdown":"Both the following declarations work for `replicate&#39; 3 5`.

Read the official [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/contents.html)!\r\n1. Start with python&#39;s basic [`str` type and its methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str). One of its methods, `find`, will find substrings in your text.\r\n2. Use the python slicing notation to extract the portion of text you need, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\ntext = &quot;&quot;&quot;YOUR TEXT HERE...&quot;&quot;&quot;\r\nmeta_start = &#39;In the high court of gujarat&#39;\r\nmeta_end = &#39;ORAL JUDGMENT&#39;\r\npos1 = text.find(meta_start)\r\npos2 = text.find(meta_end)\r\nif pos2 &gt; pos1 and pos1 &gt; -1:\r\n    # text is found, extract it\r\n    text1 = text[meta_start + len(meta_start):meta_end - 1]\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. After that, you can go ahead and save your extracted text to a database.\r\n\r\nOf course, a better and more complicated solution would be to use [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html?highlight=re#module-re), but that&#39;s another story -- try finding the right way for yourself!\r\n\r\nAs to italics and other text formatting, you won&#39;t ever be able to mark it out in plain text (unless you have some &#39;meta&#39; markers, like e.g. [i] tags).

The short facts giving rise to the \r\npresent appeal are that on 10.11.2006 at about \r\n18.00 hours, the complainant visited the place of \r\nthe respondent accused situated at Juna \r\nMakhanpura, Rabarivad, Nadiad along with panch \r\nwitness and the respondent was found dealing in \r\nprovisional items. The complainant identified \r\nhimself as a Food Inspector and after giving \r\nintimation in Form No.6 has purchased muddamal \r\nsample of mustard seeds in the presence of the \r\npanchas for the purpose of analysis. Thereafter, \r\nthe complainant Food Inspector has divided the \r\nsaid sample in equal three parts and after \r\ncompleting formalities of packing and sealing \r\nobtained signatures of the vendor and panchas and \r\nout of the said three parts, one part was sent to \r\nthe Public Analyst, Vadodara for analysis and \r\nremaining two parts were sent to the Local Health \r\nAuthority, Gandhinagar. Thereafter, the Public \r\nAnalyst forwarded his report. In the said report, \r\nit is stated that the muddamal sample of mustard \r\nseeds is misbranded which is in breach of the \r\nprovisions of the Food Adulteration Act, 1954 \r\n(for short “the Act”) and the Rules framed \r\nthereunder. It is alleged that, therefore, the \r\nsample of mustard seeds was misbranded and, \r\nthereby, the accused has committed the offence. \r\n**Page  2 of  12\r\nR/CR.A/251/2009*                                                                                                 JUDGMENT*\r\nHence, the complaint came to be lodged against \r\nthe respondent accused.\r\n\r\nI want to be able to write a program such that it follows the given constraints. Be wary of the fact that this is only a single file i have like 40k files and it should run on all the files. All the files have some difference but the basic format for every file is the same.\r\n\r\nConstraints.\r\n\r\n 1. It should start the text extraction process from after the &quot;metadata&quot; . Metadata is the data about the file from the starting of the file i.e &quot; In the high court of gujarat&quot; till Oral Judgment. In all the files i have , there are various POINTS after the &lt;oral judgement&gt; string ends. So i need all these points as a separate paragraph ( see the text has 2 points , i need it in different paragraphs ).\r\n\r\n 2. Check the lines in italics, these are the panes in the text/pdf file. I need to remove these as these donot have any meaning to the text content i want. \r\n\r\n 3. These files are both available in TEXT or PDF format so i can use either. But i am new to python so i dont know how and where to start. I just have basic knowledge in python. \r\n\r\n 4. This data is going to be made into a &quot;corpus&quot; for further processes in building a huge expert system so you know what needs to be done i hope.\r\n\r\n

issue with your code is not directly related to the input size. Rather, in an indirect way, the negative number of inversions you find is the result of an overflow in the variable `inversion` of the function `merge`.\r\n\r\nConsider the case for your input size `N = 100000`. If this array of numbers is sorted in decreasing order, then all the ordered pairs in that array will be an inversion. In other words, there will be `N * (N-1) / 2` inversions to be counted. As you may have noticed, that value is slightly higher than the bounds of `unsigned int` type. Consequently, when you try and count this value in a variable of type int, overflow occurs, leading to a negative result.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this issue, you should change the type of the variable `inversion` from `int` to `long long`, in functions `merge` and `Msort`. (You should also update the return type of the functions `merge` and `Msort`) Naturally, you should assign the return value of the `Msort` call in the `main` function to a variable of type `long long` as well. In other words, change the type of variable `no_Of_Inversions` into a long long as well.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110255/counting-inversions-with-merge-sort-gives-a-negative-number-if-the-array-length/58112551#58112551","title":"counting inversions with merge sort gives a negative number if the array length is 100000"}],"owner":{"reputation":3,"user_id":6423101,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/sveeh.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Shamaz","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6423101/shamaz"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"accepted_answer_id":58112551,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569492734,"creation_date":1569476577,"question_id":58110255,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110255","body_markdown":"I am still a beginner at programming and i am taking an online course (algorithms)\r\n\r\none of the practice questions was to count the number of inversions in a file containing 100000 numbers randomly ordered.

Bottom line, if you simply use `==` that does not distinguish between `+0` and `-0`, and if you ignore `NaN` values, both identities hold. But you can tell the expressions apart based on rounding-mode by looking at the bit-patterns as you can get `-0` in one case and `0` in the other.\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s another example that I always found surprising. Consider the definition of `fma`:\r\n\r\n    fma (a, b, c) = a * b + c; but with only one rounding instead of two\r\n\r\nIf you put in `c = 0` in the above identity, you might expect the following to hold:\r\n\r\n    fma (a, b, 0) == a * b\r\n\r\nAlas, it fails if the multiplication generates `-0`, since `-0 + 0` is `+0`. On the left-hand side, you&#39;d get `+0`, on the right-hand side you&#39;d get `-0`.\r\n\r\nAgain, these would compare equal using regular `==`, but if you&#39;re interested in bit-wise equality, you have to watch out for the sign of zero!","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110249/floating-point-subtractive-identities/58110910#58110910","title":"Floating-point subtractive identities"}],"owner":{"reputation":10377,"user_id":45843,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":91,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/55f76441107f14055f95e08bb7bd01df?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"rwallace","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/45843/rwallace"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":52,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":58110789,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1569482769,"creation_date":1569476568,"question_id":58110249,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58110249","body_markdown":"As I understand it, in IEEE floating point, the following identity really does always apply:\r\n\r\n    x - 0.0 == x\r\n\r\nBut the following mathematical identity may not necessarily always apply, due to issues regarding signed zero:\r\n\r\n    0.0 - x == -x\r\n\r\nIs this correct?","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58110249/floating-point-subtractive-identities","title":"Floating-point subtractive identities"},{"tags":["google-chrome","google-chrome-extension"],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":369,"user_id":908382,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/WpxLp.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Tom Shaw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/908382/tom-shaw"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1569491998,"creation_date":1569491998,"answer_id":58114278,"question_id":58110245,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58114278","body_markdown":"Here&#39;s a start.
