- Read 1.\r\n - Read 2.\r\n - Read Solution\r\n - C is frustrating, but it&#39;s pretty fun.\r\n\r\nA few things: \r\n\r\n 1. You don&#39;t need to cast the return value of malloc, since it\r\n    returns a void pointer.\r\n 2. (*newStudent).name is equivalent to newStudent-&gt;name. (Ie,\r\n    dereferencing your newStudent pointer and obtaining the name member\r\n    of the StudentListNode struct).\r\n\r\n**Your segfault problem (I think):** \r\n&quot;*&amp;name&quot; is essentially asking to deference the address of the variable name. Remember, &amp;varname will give you the address of variable varname, while pointers to addresses, when dereferenced will &quot;follow&quot; the address in memory &quot;listed&quot; under the variable name. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Solution:** \r\nstrcpy takes in two arguments (two pointers to strings) \r\nso you can just send strcpy(newStudent-&gt;name, name)\r\n\r\n**BUT** before this, you need to malloc for the string name INSIDE the struct newStudent. \r\n\r\nIe, newStudent.name = malloc(sizeof(char)*sizeof(name)), or since sizeof(char) = 1, \r\nnewStudent.name = malloc(sizeof(name)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Note:** if you used malloc(strlen(name)), you&#39;d need to account for the null terminator, ie, malloc(strlen(name) + 1). But sizeof will count this for you.

The issue with this solution is that my SQL calls are pretty complex and it is a huge pain to keep converting my SQL to a LINQ statement.\r\n\r\nAny explanations as to what is happening or what I am doing wrong would be greatly appreciated.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965143/fromsql-with-non-existing-entity","title":"FromSql with Non-Existing Entity"},{"tags":["java","caesar-cipher"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":91904,"user_id":5221149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4qlq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221149/andreas"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568676251,"post_id":57965139,"comment_id":102341803,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965139/how-to-include-in-caesar-cipher#comment102341803_57965139"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":91904,"user_id":5221149,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/s4qlq.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andreas","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5221149/andreas"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568676825,"creation_date":1568676825,"answer_id":57965561,"question_id":57965139,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57965561","body_markdown":"You re-write your logic like this:\r\n\r\n\tprivate static final String KEY = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ&quot;;\r\n\tpublic static String shift(String input, int amount) {\r\n\t\tfinal int keyLen = KEY.length();\r\n\t\tfinal int shift = (amount % keyLen + keyLen) % keyLen;\r\n\t\tchar[] buf = input.toCharArray();\r\n\t\tfor (int i = 0; i &lt; buf.length; i++) {\r\n\t\t\tint idx = KEY.indexOf(buf[i]);\r\n\t\t\tif (idx != -1)\r\n\t\t\t\tbuf[i] = KEY.charAt((idx + shift) % keyLen);\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t\treturn new String(buf);\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n*Test*\r\n\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, -1));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 0));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 1));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 2));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 3));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 30));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 30), -30));\r\n\tSystem.out.println(shift(shift(&quot;Hello World&quot;, 30), 23));\r\n\r\n*Output*\r\n\r\n```lang-none\r\nGdkkn Vnqkc\r\nHello World\r\nIfmmp Xpsme\r\nJgnnq Yqtnf\r\nKhoor Zruog\r\nlHOOR _RUOG\r\nHello World\r\nHello World\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965139/how-to-include-in-caesar-cipher/57965561#57965561","title":"How to include &quot;_&quot; in Caesar Cipher"}],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11810810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1debfeb83e57e42a372ff247802eaed8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pythos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11810810/pythos"},"last_editor":{"reputation":1,"user_id":11810810,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1debfeb83e57e42a372ff247802eaed8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Pythos","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11810810/pythos"},"comment_count":1,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":33,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568676825,"creation_date":1568673021,"last_edit_date":1568673479,"question_id":57965139,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965139","body_markdown":"I have a ceaser cipher code for java, it works fine, but the message I am trying to decode has `&quot;_&quot;` for spaces.

have may flaws in your logic.

Server 2012 database - I need to pull absence data from our timesheet system. There needs to be 1 row per absence type per employee per date, however 1 column in the result set - the &quot;Event ID&quot; needs to lag back to the first date value of the &quot;absence event&quot;, based on if the days absence havs been continous working days. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve managed to create a &quot;helper column&quot; which (I think) succesfully shows &quot;Relevant&quot; if it is the first &quot;Event ID&quot; of a working day chain based on the criteria above. \r\n\r\nI need any row which does NOT have &quot;Relevant&quot; listed in the &quot;Relevant&quot; column to have the &quot;Event ID&quot; column lag back to the most recent row which does, as long as that row also has the same employee number/type of absence.\r\nAny row which DOES have &quot;Relevant&quot; listed needs to just display the &quot;Event ID&quot; I&#39;ve already created for that row. \r\n\r\nI&#39;ve tried a standard lag, but obviously it only moves 1 row up which isn&#39;t always to the &quot;Relevant&quot; event ID.

Instead, you need to just change the opacity of the image you are hovering on.\r\n\r\n    document.getElementById(&#39;pic-&#39; + pictures[i])\r\n      .addEventListener(&#39;mouseover&#39;,function(){    \r\n        x[i].style.opacity = &quot;1&quot;;    \r\n        x[i].style.transition = &quot;all 0.5s ease&quot;;\r\n      });\r\n\r\nOne more thing though. You are using the variable, `i` to add the listeners. When the mouseover event fires, that variable will have changed and the code will fail. Instead, create a new variable, called `h4` like `var h4 = x[i];` right before you add the event listener. Then, instead of `x[i]...` in the code above, you would use `h4.style.opacity = &quot;1&quot;...`","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965115/get-js-mouseover-mouseleave-to-display-different-text-over-images-in-html-docu/57965251#57965251","title":"get JS (mouseover,mouseleave) to display different text over images in html document"}],"owner":{"reputation":11,"user_id":12076385,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zxs8x.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"fulpl","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076385/fulpl"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":41,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"answer_count":2,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568674306,"creation_date":1568672807,"question_id":57965115,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965115","body_markdown":"I&#39;m trying to get Javascript do display text whenever someone hovers onto an image.

The `SimpleDateFormat` class and its siblings are flawed,  developed by people who did not understand date-time handling. Avoid these classes entirely.\r\n\r\n# ISO 8601\r\n\r\nYour input string represents a moment in [UTC][3] using standard [ISO 8601][4] format. The `Z` on the end is short for UTC, and is pronounced “Zulu”.\r\n\r\nThe *java.time* classes use the standard ISO 8601 formats by default when parsing/generating strings. So no need to specify a formatting pattern.\r\n\r\nFor a moment in UTC, use the class [`Instant`][5]. \r\n\r\n    Instant instant = Instant.parse( &quot;2019-09-10T07:06:26.287Z&quot; ) ;\r\n\r\nTo see this same moment through the wall-clock time used by the people of a particular region, apply a `ZoneId` (time zone) to get a `ZonedDateTime` object.\r\n\r\n    ZoneId z = ZoneId.of( &quot;America/Montreal&quot; ) ;\r\n    ZonedDateTime zdt = instant.atZone( z ) ;\r\n\r\nSee this [code run live at IdeOne.com][6]. \r\n\r\n&gt;instant.toString():

am trying to find the best way to create a type-safe version of lodash `get()` function.\r\nI did my research and I have come up with a get function that works something like this (The actual types are a bit more complicated):\r\n\r\n    export function get&lt;Target&gt;(getter: () =&gt; Target, defaultValue: Target): Target {\r\n        try {\r\n          return getter();\r\n         } catch (e) {\r\n           return defaultValue;\r\n         }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works nice, and it allows me to do something like this:\r\n\r\n    get(() =&gt; a!.b!.c!.d, &#39;someDefaultValue&#39;);\r\n\r\nbut I really don&#39;t like the &quot;!&quot; syntax. It feels unneeded.\r\nI have found some alternative [solutions][1] for this, that try to convert the given object into an &quot;all optional&quot; type (Partial), but things get nasty when trying to convert it back to the real object and I don&#39;t like it.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to get rid of the &quot;!&quot; syntax? \r\nI even thought of maybe writing a custom rule for typescript that will swallow the &quot;Object is possibly &#39;undefined&#39;.ts(2532)&quot; error if we are inside the context of my get function, but I don&#39;t know if typescript allows this kind of stuff.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: for the ones who are interested in the full declaration of the function, I used function overloading to cover all the cases so it looks like this:\r\n\r\n    export function get&lt;Target&gt;(getter: () =&gt; Target): Target | undefined;\r\n    export function get&lt;Target&gt;(getter: () =&gt; Target, defaultValue: Target): Target;\r\n    export function get(getter: () =&gt; any, defaultValue?: any): any {\r\n      try {\r\n        return getter();\r\n      } catch (e) {\r\n        return defaultValue;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://github.com/RIP21/ts-get\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965083/best-way-to-create-something-like-lodash-get-in-typescript","title":"Best way to create something like lodash get in typescript?"},{"tags":["c"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":13332,"user_id":6699433,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":67,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/1mOTM.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"klutt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6699433/klutt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568672862,"post_id":57965078,"comment_id":102341100,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965078/calculate-the-days-between-two-dates-but-the-results-are-wrong#comment102341100_57965078"},{"owner":{"reputation":12718,"user_id":1116364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b67dfca0caba03083330d39a304b1766?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Jour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1116364/daniel-jour"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568673249,"post_id":57965078,"comment_id":102341198,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965078/calculate-the-days-between-two-dates-but-the-results-are-wrong#comment102341198_57965078"},{"owner":{"reputation":28409,"user_id":4142924,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/KmZTf.png?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Weather Vane","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4142924/weather-vane"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568675780,"post_id":57965078,"comment_id":102341723,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965078/calculate-the-days-between-two-dates-but-the-results-are-wrong#comment102341723_57965078"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4882,"user_id":1978471,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mIJrw.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"david72","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1978471/david72"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568678182,"creation_date":1568678182,"answer_id":57965692,"question_id":57965078,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57965692","body_markdown":"See [mktime][1] example how to create 2 **struct tm** objects, and then you could easily compare them.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/mktime/","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965078/calculate-the-days-between-two-dates-but-the-results-are-wrong/57965692#57965692","title":"Calculate the days between two dates, but the results are wrong"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12061175,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pBrsXfVCm_Y/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAA5Y/7SDb0x1CEnY/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Chrome","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12061175/chrome"},"last_editor":{"reputation":12718,"user_id":1116364,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":62,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/b67dfca0caba03083330d39a304b1766?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Daniel Jour","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/1116364/daniel-jour"},"comment_count":3,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":36,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"closed_date":1568679420,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568678182,"creation_date":1568672546,"last_edit_date":1568673139,"question_id":57965078,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965078","body_markdown":"I did a program that calculates the days different, between two dates, but it is calculating months and days, yet only printing days, like, for example, if its  2 months and 25 days, its only printing 25 days, I want it to calculate in days only so the answer wont be 2 months and 25 days, but 68 days alone.\r\n\r\n~~~\r\n#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;\r\n#include &lt;string.h&gt;

Here are a couple of alternatives you could look at, which may or may not be more appropriate for you situation.\r\n\r\nUsing the debug trap is one way that at least works for your toy example. From the `man` section for `trap`:\r\n\r\n&gt; If a sigspec is DEBUG,  the  command arg  is executed before every simple command, for command, case command, select command, every arithmetic for command, and before the first command executes in a shell function.\r\n\r\nSo the following would work for the example you give:\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    \r\n    function my_debug_stuff() {\r\n        echo &quot;it is debugging&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function first() {\r\n        echo &quot;doing some first stuff&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function second() {\r\n        echo &quot;doing some second stuff&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    trap my_debug_stuff DEBUG\r\n    first\r\n    second\r\n    echo &quot;doing main stuff&quot;\r\n\r\nOf course the debug trap would also be called in all the other cases mentioned above, so I doubt how useful it will be for your real script. Probably worth a mention though. The effect of `set -T` may also have some use:\r\n\r\n&gt; If  set,  any  traps on DEBUG and RETURN are inherited by shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment.  The DEBUG and RETURN traps are normally not inherited  in such cases.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could try passing your other functions as an argument to your debug function.\r\n\r\n    #!/bin/bash\r\n    \r\n    function debug() {\r\n        echo &quot;it is debugging&quot;\r\n    \t&quot;$@&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function first() {\r\n        echo &quot;doing some first stuff&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    function second() {\r\n        echo &quot;doing some second stuff&quot;\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    debug first\r\n    debug second\r\n    echo &quot;doing main stuff&quot;\r\n\r\nAgain, not necessarily a better approach but may be preferable depending on the specifics of your real code.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965068/bash-calling-a-function-in-every-function/57965442#57965442","title":"Bash.

The firt one is more data-centric and requires a deeper understanding, but there are [solutions to that](http://automationisking.blogspot.com/2015/05/how-to-test-your-data-warehouse.html) as well.

Since a monolithic app is a single indivisible unit, you can run end-to-end testing much faster/easier.\r\n\r\nPut simply - if your app is highly testable, is highly usable. In case, the architecture and design were aligned to a very, very specific company needs - no wonder, is usable only up to a point.

It may be because I&#39;m not searching by the correct phrasing, because it&#39;s also hard to describe. Regardless, I&#39;m hoping someone out there can help.\r\n\r\n#Situation#\r\nI have an Excel Document that I was given by a co-worker and it has a table within it. It has a lot of data on it, however for the sake of this example lets say it looks like this:\r\n\r\n     Employee ID          Date Hired\r\n     -----------          ----------\r\n     1                    1/9/2019\r\n     2                    5/4/2016\r\n     3                    6/10/2017\r\n     4                    3/8/2019\r\n\r\nI want to pull additional data from SQL and connect the two tables, so the actions I took were:\r\n\r\n 1. Confirmed the Employee ID Column was formatted as a Number\r\n 2. Added the table to the data model\r\n 3. Added a new Query to the workbook that pulled in the data I wanted to add. Loaded as &quot;Connection Only&quot; but also &quot;Added to Data Model&quot;. Let&#39;s pretend that table looked like this:\r\n```\r\n     Employee ID          Name                 Email\r\n     -----------          ----------           --------------\r\n     1                    Anthony              Anthony@company.com\r\n     2                    Josh                 Josh@company.com\r\n     3                    Jay                  Jay@company.com\r\n     4                    Shane                Shane@company.com\r\n     5                    Paul                 Paula@company.com\r\n     6                    Steve                Steve@company.com\r\n```\r\n 4. From the &quot;Data&quot; tab I opened &quot;Manage Data Model&quot; and confirmed both tables were included.\r\n 5. Confirmed that the &quot;Employee ID&quot; column on both tables were classified as Data type &quot;Whole Number&quot;\r\n 6. Switched to Diagram view and created a new relationship between the two tables by dragging the Employee ID from one table to the other.\r\n\r\nNote, the relationship is formatted as:\r\n\r\n[Original Table] * ----- 1 [Query Table]\r\n\r\nHowever neither has any duplication&#39;s of the Employee ID field, which I have confirmed.\r\n\r\n#Issue#\r\n\r\nI now want to create a Pivot table to slice the data (it makes more sense with the real tables).\r\n\r\n 1. I create a new Pivot table, and on the right hand side I see both the Original table and the Query table.\r\n 2. I pull Name Column from the Query table into the Rows Area\r\n 3. I pull the Date Hired Column from the Original table into the Rows Area, below the Name Column\r\n\r\n**What I expect to see:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nAnthony\r\n     1/9/2019\r\nJosh\r\n

3/8/2019\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nEssentially it can not identify which one belongs to whom, and so it lists all the dates under everyone.\r\n\r\nGiven that I&#39;ve already verified that they&#39;re the same data type and that there are matching numbers on each table, can anyone clarify why this might be happening?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your

You can use `String.matches()`.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n      String str = &quot;ksksks8ksksksksksks&quot;;\r\n\t  System.out.println(str.matches(&quot;.*\\\\d.*&quot;));\r\n```\r\nHonestly though, if you can do it anyway you want, I would simply write a method as follows.  Regular expressions are great for complicated patterns but they are also expensive in terms of processing.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   public static boolean containsNumber(String str) {\r\n\t  boolean found = false;\r\n\t  for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {\r\n\t\t if (Character.isDigit(c)) {\r\n\t\t\tfound = true;\r\n\t\t\tbreak;\r\n\t\t }\r\n\t  }\r\n\t  return found;\r\n   }\r\n```\r\nYou could also modify the above and call it `indexOf` and iterate thru the characters using a regular for loop.  Then returning either the location of the first digit or -1 just like the `String` version of indexOf().\r\n\r\nAnd finally, for fun, you could use the Streams capability of Java 8+.\r\n\r\n```java\r\n   public static boolean containsNumber(String str) {\r\n\t  return str.chars().filter(Character::isDigit).count() &gt; 0;\r\n   }\r\n```","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965040/how-to-use-indexof-to-see-if-a-string-contain-numbers/57965152#57965152","title":"How to use IndexOf to see if a string contain numbers"}],"owner":{"reputation":16,"user_id":12022407,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-at9hO_2Gcj4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3reCgaFy7QKaGi6Uhikn6UPY4BAMKA/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Eric Dants","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12022407/eric-dants"},"last_editor":{"reputation":2286,"user_id":751621,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":83,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1c39aa04d169149a5f792167abcdbbbd?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"craigcaulfield","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/751621/craigcaulfield"},"comment_count":5,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":44,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":2,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":57965152,"answer_count":1,"score":-1,"last_activity_date":1568705868,"creation_date":1568672188,"last_edit_date":1568705868,"question_id":57965040,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965040","body_markdown":"I need to use `indexOf` to find numbers inside a string, and it gives me the error: \r\n\r\n&gt;

You should arrange to have the UID of the user available at the time of the resize, so you can update the correct user.

However, if you still want to optimize the size of your URL, I have two solutions for you.\r\n\r\nAs we already know, the URL of a picture looks similar to this:\r\n\r\n    https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-id/o/images_folder%2vvTMvCsCRsckpR3R5Qg2s.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=2277f575-8ff7-2211-8262-a28ef679d703\r\n\r\nSo the first solution would be to shorten the links using a service like [tiny.cc](https://tiny.cc/). There are also other examples but I think you get the idea. So in case of the URL above, after you shorten it, will look like this:\r\n\r\n&gt; http:// tiny.cc /2r4ucz\r\n\r\nThe second solution requires the saving two things in your database. It is not about shorten the link, it&#39;s about storing less data. So as you can see, the URL above is combined from a &quot;BASE_URL&quot;:\r\n\r\n    https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/project-id/o/images_folder\r\n\r\nWhich includes the name of your project and the name of the folder where you store the images. It also contains the name of the image, which in my case is an id that is generated by Firestore and it&#39;s by definion unique. And the last part is the token id:\r\n\r\n    2277f575-8ff7-2211-8262-a28ef679d703\r\n\r\nSo the second solution would be to store in your database only the id of the image and the token and then reconstruct the entire URL client side. So in the example above the only things that you should store are:\r\n\r\n    Firestore-root\r\n      |\r\n      --- users (collection)\r\n           |\r\n           --- uid (document)\r\n                |\r\n                --- id: vvTMvCsCRsckpR3R5Qg2s\r\n                |\r\n                --- token: 2277f575-8ff7-2211-8262-a28ef679d703\r\n                |\r\n                --- //Other user details\r\n\r\nIf your user will always have a single picture then you can use instead of that random id, the `uid` that is coming from the authentication processs:\r\n\r\n    String uid = FirebaseAuth.getInstance().getCurrentUser().getUid();","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965015/firebase-google-cloud-storage-how-to-store-the-image/57965359#57965359","title":"Firebase/Google Cloud Storage how to store the image"}],"owner":{"reputation":1340,"user_id":9386667,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rrovb.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Badgy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/9386667/badgy"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":1,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":2,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568701307,"creation_date":1568671979,"question_id":57965015,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965015","body_markdown":"I have a Firestore that has a User Document.

When you right-click the dialog box, you will find that you cannot add class. \r\n[![enter image description here][1]][1]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this dialog, you can only use this function **DialogBoxW(hInstance, lpTemplate, hWndParent, lpDialogFunc)** to create and show the dialog in your program. The third parameter is the Handle of parent window and it can be NULL. The forth parameter is the callback function.\r\nSo we test to call DialogBoxW in WinMain. You can check the picture below. We abandoned the traditional Win32 framework and made the custom window our main window. It work.\r\n[![enter image description here][2]][2]\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be noted that windows created in this form are modal, which is not applicable in many scenarios. What you say and what you want to do may be better done with MFC. Win32 does not encapsulate many interfaces like MFC for you to call. \r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/17TSv.png\r\n  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/S6CZN.png","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57965000/how-do-i-edit-my-windows-desktop-application-main-dialog-in-visual-studio-commun/57987831#57987831","title":"How do I edit my Windows Desktop Application main dialog in VIsual Studio Commun2019?"}],"owner":{"reputation":6,"user_id":12076512,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://graph.facebook.com/2447366552021674/picture?type=large","display_name":"Rodrigo Dalto&#233; Madruga","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076512/rodrigo-dalto%c3%a9-madruga"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":65,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":3,"up_vote_count":1,"answer_count":3,"score":-2,"last_activity_date":1568795899,"creation_date":1568671870,"question_id":57965000,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57965000","body_markdown":"I have to create a Win32 app for a college class.\r\nI created the &quot;Windows Desktop Application&quot; in the create project section of the Visual Studio Community 2019 and it comes already with a standard dialog that can be tested on the go.

On Android Q, is there an official way to let alarms work correctly? To open an Activity that will be shown to the user, exactly as an alarm clock app should?\r\n\r\n2. What&#39;s wrong in the code I&#39;ve made? How come it works on P but not always on Q? \r\n\r\n----\r\nEDIT: OK after being adviced to have a notification shown while I start the Activity, and also use FullScreenIntent, I got something to work, but it&#39;s only working when the screen is turned off. When the screen is turned on, it only shows the notification, which is a bad thing because the whole point is to have an alarm being shown to the user, and some users (like me) don&#39;t want to have heads-up-notification for alarms, popping out in the middle of something and not pausing anything. I hope someone can help with this, as this used to be a very easy thing to do, and now it got way too complex...\r\n\r\nHere&#39;s the current code (available [**here**][4]) :\r\n\r\n**NotificationId**\r\n\r\n    object NotificationId {\r\n        const val ALARM_TRIGGERED = 1\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        private var hasInitialized = false\r\n    \r\n        @UiThread\r\n        @JvmStatic\r\n        fun initNotificationsChannels(context: Context) {\r\n            if (hasInitialized || Build.VERSION.SDK_INT &lt; Build.VERSION_CODES.O)\r\n                return\r\n            hasInitialized = true\r\n            val channelsToUpdateOrAdd = HashMap&lt;String, NotificationChannel&gt;()\r\n            val channel = NotificationChannel(context.getString(R.string.channel_id__alarm_triggered), context.getString(R.string.channel_name__alarm_triggered), NotificationManager.IMPORTANCE_HIGH)\r\n            channel.description = context.getString(R.string.channel_description__alarm_triggered)\r\n            channel.enableLights(true)\r\n            channel.setSound(null, null)\r\n            channel.lockscreenVisibility = Notification.VISIBILITY_PUBLIC\r\n            channel.enableVibration(false)\r\n            channel.setShowBadge(false)\r\n            channelsToUpdateOrAdd[channel.id] = channel\r\n            //\r\n            val notificationManager = context.getSystemService(Context.NOTIFICATION_SERVICE) as NotificationManager\r\n            val existingChannels = notificationManager.notificationChannels\r\n            if (existingChannels != null)\r\n                for (existingChannel in existingChannels) {\r\n                    //                The importance of an existing channel will only be changed if the new importance is lower than the current value and the user has not altered any settings on this channel.\r\n                    //                The group an existing channel will only be changed if the channel does not already belong to a group.

The problem maybe comme to here.\r\n\r\nThen, the dispatch allow to not directly query the sub-service `tweet-dot-my-project.appspot.com/tweet` but directly the base service`my-project.appspot.com/tweet` and the query is redirected to the right `tweet` service\r\n\r\nFinally, there is an abnormal behavior on AppEngine.\r\n\r\n**If you have only 1 endpoint, like /tweet**\r\n\r\nHere, in your `dispatch.yaml`, you redirect all the url under `*/tweet/` to be handle by the `tweet` service. But the `/tweet` endpoint isn&#39;t redirected. Update your dispatch without the last `/` on tweet\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - url: &quot;*/tweet*&quot;\r\n    service: tweet\r\n```\r\n\r\n**If you have other sub-endpoints, like /tweet/other**\r\nThis time, your `dispatch.yaml` is valid, with and without the last `/`\r\n\r\nThis doesn&#39;t explain the `502 Bad Gateway` error. So, I got it in my tests. Look at my code:\r\n```\r\nfrom flask import Flask, jsonify\r\n\r\napp = Flask(__name__)\r\n\r\n@app.route(&#39;/tweet&#39;)  # handles /tweet route\r\ndef root():\r\n    response = { &#39;message&#39;: &quot;Hello from the Tweet service&quot; }\r\n    return jsonify(response)\r\n\r\n@app.route(&#39;/tweet/other&#39;)  # handles /tweet route\r\ndef root():\r\n    response = { &#39;message&#39;: &quot;Hello from the Tweet/other service&quot; }\r\n    return jsonify(response)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI copy paste too quickly your code, and I have 2 `root()` functions. That causes service crash and thus a 502 errors. \r\n\r\nCheck your REAL code (*the provided code isn&#39;t fully correct, I imagine there is more than this 2 endpoints*) and the logs, find your crash cause, and fix it.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964959/how-dispatch-yaml-works-in-practice/57967263#57967263","title":"How dispatch.yaml works in practice"}],"owner":{"reputation":147,"user_id":8518863,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":50,"profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/dOBn9.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"puoygae","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/8518863/puoygae"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":48,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568693666,"creation_date":1568671570,"question_id":57964959,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57964959","body_markdown":"I understand that the role of `dispatch.yaml` is to redirect requests to the suitable microservice. \r\n\r\nBelow is my dispatch.yaml:\r\n\r\n    dispatch:\r\n      - url: &quot;*/favicon.ico&quot;\r\n        service: default\r\n    \r\n      - url: &quot;*/tweet/*&quot;\r\n        service: tweet\r\n\r\nThe project has two services: `default` and `tweet`.

page.  Due to the competitive nature of the client&#39;s industry, the client wants to be able to select certain products to NOT appear amongst the Latest Products.\r\n\r\nFor this, I have added a custom &quot;Hide from Latest Products&quot; checkbox to the product editor with this code:\r\n\r\n    add_action(&#39;add_meta_boxes&#39;, &#39;gd_add_product_extra_options_metabox&#39;);\r\n    function gd_add_product_extra_options_metabox(){\r\n        add_meta_box(&quot;product_extra_options_meta&quot;, &quot;Extra Options&quot;, &quot;gd_product_extra_options_metabox&quot;, &quot;product&quot;, &quot;side&quot;, &quot;high&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // ADD CUSTOM FIELDS //\r\n    function gd_product_extra_options_metabox(){\r\n    global $post;\r\n        // Nonce field to validate form request came from current site\r\n        wp_nonce_field( basename( __FILE__ ), &#39;product_fields&#39; );\r\n        // Get the field data if it&#39;s already been entered\r\n    $hide_from_latest = get_post_meta( $post-&gt;ID, &#39;hide_from_latest&#39;, true );\r\n    if($hide_from_latest == &#39;1&#39;){$checked = &#39; checked&#39;;}else{$checked = &#39;&#39;;}\r\n        // Output the field\r\n    echo &#39;&lt;p&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;checkbox&quot; name=&quot;hide_from_latest&quot; value=&quot;1&quot;&#39; . $checked . &#39;&gt; Hide from Latest Products&lt;/p&gt;&#39;;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nAnd so on and so forth with the saving code, etc.  The checkbox appears to work perfectly.\r\n\r\nThe problem though, is in writing a custom product query to fetch all of the latest products for which this checkbox is NOT checked.\r\n\r\nFor testing, I have checked and saved the &quot;Hide&quot; option for only 1 product.\r\nI have my query as follows:\r\n\r\n    $products = new WP_Query( array (\r\n    &#39;post_type&#39;         =&gt; &#39;product&#39;,\r\n    &#39;post_status&#39;       =&gt; &#39;publish&#39;,\r\n    &#39;posts_per_page&#39;    =&gt; &#39;100&#39;,\r\n    &#39;order_by&#39;          =&gt; &#39;date&#39;,\r\n    &#39;order&#39;             =&gt; &#39;ASC&#39;,\r\n    &#39;meta_query&#39;        =&gt; array(\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;key&#39;       =&gt; &#39;hide_from_latest&#39;,\r\n            &#39;value&#39;     =&gt; &#39;1&#39;,\r\n            &#39;compare&#39;   =&gt; &#39;NOT LIKE&#39;\r\n        ),\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThis gives me a very empty screen with &quot;There is no results.&quot;\r\n\r\nIf, however, I change the meta_query to:\r\n\r\n    &#39;meta_query&#39;        =&gt; array(\r\n        array(\r\n            &#39;key&#39;       =&gt; &#39;hide_from_latest&#39;,\r\n            &#39;value&#39;     =&gt; &#39;1&#39;,\r\n            &#39;compare&#39;   =&gt; &#39;LIKE&#39;\r\n        ),\r\n    )\r\n\r\nThen it fetches and displays the 1 single product that I have checked and saved the option for.\r\n\r\nI have tried various other options such as using &quot;=&quot; and &quot;!=&quot; for &#39;compare&#39;, I&#39;ve tried changing the value of the checkbox to &quot;on&quot; and then having &#39;value&#39; =&gt; &#39;on&#39; in the meta_query, etc.  The results are always the same.\r\n\r\nWhere have I gone wrong?\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nHere is my full code:\r\n\r\n        // ADD CUSTOM OPTIONS TO WOOCOMMERCE PRODUCTS //\r\n    add_action(&#39;add_meta_boxes&#39;, &#39;gd_add_product_extra_options_metabox&#39;);\r\n    function gd_add_product_extra_options_metabox(){\r\n        add_meta_box(&quot;product_extra_options_meta&quot;, &quot;Extra Options&quot;, &quot;gd_product_extra_options_metabox&quot;, &quot;product&quot;, &quot;side&quot;, &quot;high&quot;);\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    // ADD CUSTOM FIELDS //\r\n    function gd_product_extra_options_metabox(){\r\n    global $post;\r\n        // Nonce field to validate form request came from current site\r\n        wp_nonce_field( basename( __FILE__ ), &#39;notice_fields&#39;

They&#39;re essentially suggestions as to what you want.  The browser will try to capture at the frame rate and resolution that you asked for.  If it can&#39;t match it exactly (and if you haven&#39;t specified `exact`), it will do the best it can.  In your case, the closest frame rate to what you asked for on your camera must be at a different resolution.\r\n\r\nWhat you need to do is use [`.videoHeight`][1] and [`.videoWidth`][2] properties of the video element you&#39;re displaying the video in.\r\n\r\nThe best way to handle this is listen for the [`resize`][3] event.  This is important, as the width/height can actually change at any time!  Sometimes, the video may get smaller mid-stream if the system can&#39;t keep up with the large video.  A more practical example is when you rotate your phone, and the video rotates with it.  the `resize` event will fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/videoHeight\r\n  [2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/videoWidth\r\n  [3]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLVideoElement/videoWidth#Example","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964949/how-and-why-does-frame-rate-change-the-aspect-ratio-of-a-html5-video-or-canvas/57964986#57964986","title":"How and why does frame rate change the aspect ratio of a HTML5 video or canvas?"}],"owner":{"reputation":110,"user_id":4333635,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":75,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/1b6408abc6df9f439be3ece586c73922?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"swabygw","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/4333635/swabygw"},"last_editor":{"reputation":123395,"user_id":362536,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":88,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/da5816365344305a614343a4065a2786?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"Brad","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/362536/brad"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":19,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":2,"accepted_answer_id":57964986,"answer_count":1,"score":2,"last_activity_date":1568671892,"creation_date":1568671490,"last_edit_date":1568671892,"question_id":57964949,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57964949","body_markdown":"When I change the frameRate in the code examples below, the aspect ratio of my webcam changes (see code below and attached images) on the Video element.

The max range label reads 8.7 even after I slide it three steps to the left. It filters out data as expected, but the labels don&#39;t update, so it continues to read 8.7.[image of slider label behavior][2]\r\n\r\n2)The label on the minimum of the range does not include the lowest data point, despite displaying that bar on the graph:\r\n[image of nonsensical range][3]\r\n\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen this before dealing with decimals in google charts?

It has a search bar and several refinements.\r\n\r\nI want the user to be able to press a button and get a list of *all* matching results.\r\n\r\nTo get a list of *all* results, I need to use the [Browse Index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/browse/?language=ruby) instead of the [Search Index](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/search/). The Browse Index allows retrieving all hits; the Search Index allows retrieval of only up to 1000 hits. However, the Browse Index should not be used in UIs. So I want to create an API endpoint my web server that uses the Browse Index in order return a list of matching hits given a search query.\r\n\r\nI am able to successfully do this for a search query, but I can&#39;t figure out how to this for refinements.\r\n\r\nHere is a sketch of what I have so far.\r\n\r\nBack-end (in Ruby):\r\n\r\n    ALGOLIA_INDEX = Algolia::Index.new(&#39;Products&#39;)\r\n\r\n    class AlgoliaSearchController &lt; ActionController::Base\r\n      def get_search_results\r\n        query = params[&#39;query&#39;]\r\n        hits = []\r\n        ALGOLIA_INDEX.browse({query: query}) do |hit|\r\n          hits &lt;&lt; hit\r\n        end\r\n        render json: hits\r\n      end\r\n    end\r\n\r\nFrontend:\r\n\r\n    import qs from &#39;qs&#39;;\r\n    import React, { useCallback, useState } from &#39;react&#39;;\r\n    import { InstantSearch } from &#39;react-instantsearch-dom&#39;;\r\n\r\n    function getSearchResults(query) {\r\n      const queryString = qs.stringify({\r\n        query,\r\n      })\r\n      return fetch(`/search_results?{queryString}`);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\r\n    function App() {\r\n      const [searchState, setSearchState] = useState(null);\r\n      const onSearchStateChange = useCallback(searchState =&gt; {\r\n        setSearchState(searchState);\r\n      }, [searchState]);\r\n      const onClick = useCallback(() =&gt; {\r\n        console.log(getSearchResults(searchstate.query));\r\n      });\r\n\r\n      return (\r\n        &lt;InstantSearch ... onSearchStateChange={onSearchStateChange}&gt;\r\n          &lt;button onClick={onClick}&gt;Search&lt;/button&gt;\r\n        &lt;/InstantSearch&gt;\r\n      );\r\n    }\r\n\r\nI can&#39;t find any resources that explain how to do search with refinements.\r\n\r\nThings I&#39;ve looked at so far:\r\n\r\n- I can try to map the  [searchState format](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/widgets/customize-an-existing-widget/react/#the-search-state-format-explained) to the [Search API Parameters](https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/search-api-parameters/) used by the Browse Index. I could write my own mapper from search state to a query, however, 1) this seems complex and I suspect I&#39;m missing something simpler and 2) this seems like this should be open-sourced somewhere since I suspect I&#39;m not the first to run into this issue.\r\n\r\n- There is an article, [Backend InstantSearch\r\n](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/going-further/backend-search/in-depth/backend-instantsearch/react/), that explains how to write a backend that can be plugged into the `InstatSearch` component. However it doesn&#39;t explain how I could do a one-off search from the search state.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964938/algolia-how-to-pass-refinements-from-a-front-end-to-a-backend","title":"Algolia: How to pass refinements from a front-end to a backend?"},{"tags":["virtual-machine","windows-server-2012","hyper-v"],"owner":{"reputation":1,"user_id":12076485,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ko2-TxsC4i0/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rd-OjL1mFdDIt-eyGQ1iG0voEMPBw/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"Ali T","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/12076485/ali-t"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":false,"view_count":5,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":0,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1568671377,"creation_date":1568671377,"question_id":57964935,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/57964935","body_markdown":"if there is a way to recover data from avhdx file , hyper-v disk corrupted , os donot run , I have only this avhdx file ","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964935/hi-please-i-want-to-ask-if-it-is-possible-to-recover-data-from-avhdx-file-form","title":"Hi , please I want to ask if it is possible to recover data from avhdx file format"},{"tags":["ios","swift"],"comments":[{"owner":{"reputation":361115,"user_id":341994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbb4d027695dfdf76bf448b15d7e306a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt"},"edited":false,"score":1,"creation_date":1568671566,"post_id":57964931,"comment_id":102340773,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964931/cant-add-label-to-view#comment102340773_57964931"},{"owner":{"reputation":60,"user_id":11529827,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-JHU6GMPMDu4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/ACHi3rdngA_5s5TUWzx3tZglTthIRx_iAw/mo/photo.jpg?sz=128","display_name":"alo gon","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11529827/alo-gon"},"reply_to_user":{"reputation":361115,"user_id":341994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbb4d027695dfdf76bf448b15d7e306a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568671829,"post_id":57964931,"comment_id":102340849,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964931/cant-add-label-to-view#comment102340849_57964931"},{"owner":{"reputation":361115,"user_id":341994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbb4d027695dfdf76bf448b15d7e306a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt"},"edited":false,"score":0,"creation_date":1568672358,"post_id":57964931,"comment_id":102340979,"link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57964931/cant-add-label-to-view#comment102340979_57964931"}],"answers":[{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":361115,"user_id":341994,"user_type":"registered","accept_rate":93,"profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbb4d027695dfdf76bf448b15d7e306a?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG","display_name":"matt","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/341994/matt"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"is_accepted":true,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1568672341,"creation_date":1568672341,"answer_id":57965059,"question_id":57964931,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/57965059","body_markdown":"The problem is this line:\r\n\r\n    label.center = CGPoint(x: 160, y: 285)\r\n\r\nIt moves the label out of the contacts view where you can’t see it.
