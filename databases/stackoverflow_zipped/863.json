However, your example itself doesn&#39;t make sense.  It is valid SQL, but why in the world would you want to do it?  Why would you compare an English sentence, to a string consisting of someone&#39;s full name but with a blob of JSON injected into the middle of it?  This is important, because your example only has one row, so the index doesn&#39;t matter.  So we have to extrapolate your example to a large number of rows, where an index would matter.  But since it doesn&#39;t make any real-world sense, how can we extrapolate it up in a sensible way?\r\n\r\n&gt; Also, I haven&#39;t understand which type of index is better - GIN or GiST. I&#39;ve read that GIN is usually better for regular full text search, but GiST is better for trigram search. Is that correct?\r\n\r\nNot generally so in my experience.  GiST trigram indexes are signature based, where each trigram sets a bit in the signature.  But there are way more trigrams than there are bits, so they are heavily overloaded. These types of indexes only perform well when they are lightly populated.  (But it is hard to say what &quot;lightly populated&quot; means ahead of time, other they &quot;try it with your real dataset and see&quot;.)  Given their unpredictability, I avoid GiST indexes unless there is a clear benefit to them, which I don&#39;t see here.\r\n\r\nGiven your query, you could use either kind of index, but would have to write it differently.  Also, it is doubtful that either index would help because in \r\n\r\n    similarity(x,exp) &gt; 0.05\r\n\r\nthe cutoff of 0.05 is so lax, that few rows will probably get rejected by the index.\r\n\r\nIf you had a higher cutoff, like 0.5, then with a GIN index would formulate it like:\r\n\r\n    set pg_trgm.similarity_threshold = 0.5;\r\n    select ... from test_table where x % exp order by x &lt;-&gt; exp ;\r\n\r\nThis will extract everything sufficiently similar, then sort them by the distance. If few enough things are &quot;sufficiently similar&quot;, this gives pretty good performance (and if not, you should revisit your choice of pg_trgm.similarity_threshold). As Laurenz Albe says, with a GiST index you can extract the rows already in order and then stop once the LIMIT is reached, but in the absence of a LIMIT clause, this is of no value.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58337081/will-trigram-index-on-multiple-columns-make-search-faster-and-how-to-make-such-s/58343770#58343770","title":"Will trigram index on multiple columns make search faster and how to make such search properly?"}],"owner":{"reputation":58,"user_id":5211007,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/f941f7ba91a8410b5961d1baad03f70c?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Sheyko Dmitriy","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/5211007/sheyko-dmitriy"},"last_editor":{"reputation":69934,"user_id":6464308,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/12PVX.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Laurenz Albe","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/6464308/laurenz-albe"},"comment_count":0,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":39,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":1,"accepted_answer_id":58337391,"answer_count":2,"score":1,"last_activity_date":1570805463,"creation_date":1570782049,"last_edit_date":1570782584,"question_id":58337081,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58337081","body_markdown":"Let&#39;s assume I have table with multiple columns.

I am using a customized object detection model to process my images. The model is based on faster_rcnn_inception_v2_pets and i am able to use both CPU and GPU to process the images. Currently each image take about 4 secs to process. When i check the task manager, the CPU and GPU is not fully utilized. I found that for each image, at the start it uses the CPU like 95% of the time and when it goes to the GPU, the results are out almost instantly. My question is, is it possible to speed this up by using multi-core processing?\r\n\r\nI have been reading up on multiprocessing and was wondering if it is possible to use multiprocessing in the CPU (example 8 core) to process images in parallel and queue them into the GPU. (I think i read somewhere that the GPU is only able to process 1 at a time.) Since the CPU is taking a long time to process 1 image while the GPU is very fast, if the above is possible it will cut down on processing time for a large number of images.\r\n\r\nThank

a question be me [here][1] i have this script provided by @utphx (thank you very much @utphx)...\r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e) {\r\n    if (Object.prototype.toString.call(e.range.getValue()) !== &quot;[object Date]&quot; ) {\r\n    e.range.setValue(e.value.toUpperCase());\r\n    }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThis works just fine, but i want to extend it a little to exclude some unicode characters like... eg... Ⓚ ☎, becuase they are in bigger font size than the letters &amp; numbers in the same cell, and after the uppercase fuction they change in the same font size like letters &amp; numbers which they look very small comparing to them. I&#39;ve try several ways that i found here and in the rest of the net but due my lack of knowledge in Java coding, and since these characters they can be in the same cell with numbers and letters, either all characters are changed to capitals or none of them. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to specify this type of characters in the above code so to exclude them from changing to uppercase ?.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: I found the following code in [this answer][2] by @Ruben and with the addition of @ocordova&#39;s [suggestion][3] about using [getFormula()][4] method, the uppercase function works properly without touching the cells that contains any formulas and these type of characters: ☎ ✈\r\n\r\n    function onEdit(e) {\r\n      var range = e.range;\r\n      var value = range.getValue();\r\n      var sheet = range.getSheet();\r\n      if (range.getRow() &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; \r\n          range.getColumn() &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; \r\n          typeof value === &#39;string&#39;) {\r\n        if(!range.getFormula()) {\r\n          range.setValue(value.toUpperCase());\r\n        } else {\r\n        if (ind === 0 &amp;&amp; e.range.rowStart &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; e.range.columnStart &gt;= 1  &amp;&amp; e.range.getFormula() == &#39;&#39;) {\r\n          e.range.setValue(e.value.toUpperCase());\r\n          return;\r\n          } \r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe only thing that i need to add now is a check if the cells contain any of these of characters: Ⓚ Ⓘ Ⓣ Ⓕ (and perhaps some more letters or numbers of this type) so to exclude them from the uppercase function. Anyone know how i can do that?. I guess a REGEX will be a solution but i have no idea how and where to put it in the above code.\r\n\r\n\r\n**EDIT2: Scratch the above EDIT. That code behaves very strangely. If you select some cells to change the border style then, it copies the values from on cell to all the other selected cells!!!. I&#39;ll post a new question about this.**\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance\r\n\r\nNessus\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]:

For some combinations of service tier and compute size changes, a replica of the database must be created in the new compute instance which involves copying data and can strongly influence the overall latency. Regardless, the database remains online during this step, and connections continue to be directed to the database in the original compute instance.\r\n\r\n**Switch routing of connections to new compute instance**\r\n\r\nExisting connections to the database in the original compute instance are dropped. Any new connections are established to the database in the new compute instance. For some combinations of service tier and compute size changes, database files are detached and reattached during the switch. Regardless, the switch can result in a brief service interruption when the database is unavailable generally for less than 30 seconds and often for only a few seconds. If there are long running transactions running when connections are dropped, the duration of this step may take longer in order to recover aborted transactions.

I have a building model called building. From this model I create many building instances. I have another model which is called forests from which I create many forests instances. (Let&#39;s assume I have even more models for which the same applies)\r\n\r\nNow I want to add data (let&#39;s call it x) for every building and for every forest for every hour of the year. That means I will have 8760 values for every building and forest instance. \r\n\r\n```\r\nFor instance: \r\nHour1 : 234\r\nHour2 : 667\r\n...\r\nHourX : x\r\n...\r\nHour8760: 34\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese 8760 values will be added, roughly estimated, 10-15 times a day, so that could lead to 131400 values a day. \r\n\r\n\r\nNow, I have doubts on how to design that. I thought I could go with a model like so: \r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Hour(models.Model):\r\n    building                = models.ForeignKey(Building, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    forest                  = models.ForeignKey(Forest, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\r\n    hour                    = models.IntegerField(...)\r\n    value                   = models.FloatField(...)\r\n    timestamp               = models.CharField(max_length=200, null=True, blank=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy second thought is to design it with a JSONField like discussed here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41134260/. \r\nSo maybe I could save a dictionary for every building and every forest OR have a separate model that stores this dictionary like ```{hour1:value, hour2:value}```\r\n\r\nMy question is what the best way would be to design what I have in mind? Is there a better way that I don&#39;t consider?\r\n\r\nI am also thinking for option1: For every value I would create a new Object of Hour. That is a lot of instances and I am scared my database gets bloated or that PostgreSQL has trouble handling it.  \r\n\r\nI am looking for some guidance for this. \r\n\r\nI would like to stick with PostgreSQL even though I read about InfluxDB and Timescale. I think PostgreSQL is very powerful and should be able to handle this. I guess attached to my question is also if it is still reasonable with the amount of data I have to handle to stick with PostgrSQL, which I hope. Last but not least I also want to write an API for it which is probably not relevant but I add it anyway. \r\n\r\nAny guidance, hints and help is very much appreciated.

(I doubt that this is the case, especially according your example).\r\n\r\nBut you may go on the level down and try low-level dynamodb client, which returns attribute map. In that case you&#39;ll be able to store other fields into a dictionary.\r\n\r\n        var result = await client.GetItemAsync(&quot;persontable&quot;, new Dictionary&lt;string, AttributeValue&gt;\r\n        {\r\n            {  &quot;PK&quot;, new AttributeValue { S = &quot;MYID123&quot; } }\r\n        });\r\n\r\n        var person = new Person\r\n        {\r\n            Id = result.Item[&quot;PK&quot;].S,\r\n            Name = result.Item[&quot;Name&quot;].S,\r\n            OtherAttributes = new Dictionary&lt;string, string&gt;()\r\n        };\r\n\r\n        foreach (var attribute in result.Item)\r\n        {\r\n            if (attribute.Key != &quot;PK&quot; &amp;&amp; attribute.Key != &quot;Name&quot;)\r\n            {\r\n                person.OtherAttributes.Add(attribute.Key, attribute.Value.S); // This code is handling only the case when attirubutes are on the top level and has string type. For more complex scenarios it should be extended additionally. \r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\nThe downside of this approach is that you&#39;ll need to handle mapping by your own and handle save operation in the same way. The code is hard to support, put still may be applicable in case of small amount of properties you handle (In your case Id and Name).\r\n\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58336991/dynamodb-persistence-model-with-extension-data/58344634#58344634","title":"DynamoDb persistence model with extension

website B exposes a WebAPI, you will have 2 options.\r\n\r\n## 1) Fetch the data from the server side of your MVC project\r\n\r\nSince you claim to have experience with the `HttpClient` this would be pretty straight forward (example pending).\r\n\r\nThe steps to take are the following; when loading your view:\r\n\r\n - make a call to the web api (most likely from your controller) and fetch the data\r\n - add this data to your viewmodel\r\n - render the data on your page\r\n\r\nexample: taken from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/advanced/calling-a-web-api-from-a-net-client\r\n\r\n**Note: this is not the best example: when using this approach please do some more research**\r\n\r\n    static HttpClient client = new HttpClient();\r\n    static async Task&lt;Product&gt; GetProductAsync(string path)\r\n    {   \r\n        Product product = null;\r\n        HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(path);\r\n        if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)\r\n        {\r\n             var jsonString = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();\r\n             model = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject&lt;YOUROBJECTTYPE&gt;(jsonString);\r\n        }\r\n        return product;\r\n    }\r\n\r\nOne of the benefits here is that authentication is often simpler. The downside is that your page load will be slower.\r\n\r\n## 2) Fetch the data client side i.e.: from the browser\r\n\r\nThrough javascript you will be able to fetch the data. Possibly with `jquery` or other frameworks. Normally you will load your page first, and then fetch the data.\r\n\r\nThe steps to take are the following;\r\n\r\n- call the api from javascript and fetch the data\r\n- manipulate the page to display the data. This is best acieved by `jquery`, `react`, `angular`, `vue.js`, `knockout` or a similar framework.\r\n\r\njQuery example:\r\n\r\n    $.ajax({  \r\n        type: &#39;GET&#39;,  \r\n        url: &#39;api/Employees&#39;,  \r\n        dataType: &#39;json&#39;,  \r\n        success: function (data) {  \r\n           //use the data here\r\n     }});\r\n\r\nThe page will load fast. After the page is loaded the call to the api is made. So the page is responsive while loading data on the background.\r\n\r\nThe down side here, is that if you need authentication, you cannot store the credentials on the clientside (e.g.; javascript) so you need a better authentication flow. Perhaps cookies or jwt tokens.","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58336989/extract-data-from-external-website-via-webapi-c-asp-net-mvc/58340261#58340261","title":"Extract data from external website via WebAPI C# ASP.Net MVC"},{"tags":[],"owner":{"reputation":4684,"user_id":2611237,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gd9EW.jpg?s=128&g=1","display_name":"Andrei Dragotoniu","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/2611237/andrei-dragotoniu"},"comment_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"is_accepted":false,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570798509,"creation_date":1570798509,"answer_id":58341723,"question_id":58336989,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/a/58341723","body_markdown":"There seems to be a total lack of understanding of that an API actually is.\r\n\r\nForget about Website B, your job is to get your data from the API.

This however needs additional buffers to store the last frame data needed. It can be quite a large bit of RAM especially for raytracers if you need more than just resulting color.\r\n\r\n2. **use stochastics instead of spliting rays**\r\n\r\n this is very common approach. You know when ray hits a surface it should split into reflection and refraction rays. The stochastic raytracing does not split. instead depending on a pseudorandom value it either reflect or refract with 50/50 chance. As you can see without splitting there is a lot less rays to cast for scene. On the other hand this produces a distinct noise (similar to old CCD camera image in low light conditions). It can be partially suppressed by averaging few last frames together (or ray trace the same scene more times per one frame) ...\r\n\r\n Another advantage of this is that it does not require recursion which is not implemented in GLSL so you can do ray tracing in GLSL much easier. Without it you would need to convert the recursion into iteration which is not simple see:\r\n\r\n - [Reflection and refraction impossible without recursive ray tracing?\r\n](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45140313/2521214)\r\n","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58336978/reducing-time-complexity-for-c-on-unreal-engine-4-22/58340544#58340544","title":"Reducing time complexity for C++ on Unreal Engine 4.22"}],"owner":{"reputation":88,"user_id":11312480,"user_type":"registered","profile_image":"https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bae1c0d0936a0a82792a1b8d44407e21?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1","display_name":"Skanda","link":"https://stackoverflow.com/users/11312480/skanda"},"comment_count":2,"delete_vote_count":0,"close_vote_count":0,"is_answered":true,"view_count":35,"favorite_count":0,"down_vote_count":0,"up_vote_count":0,"answer_count":1,"score":0,"last_activity_date":1570794049,"creation_date":1570781650,"question_id":58336978,"share_link":"https://stackoverflow.com/q/58336978","body_markdown":"I am developing a Lidar sensor on a simulation using Ray-trace. simulation is configurable to run at desired frame per second (in my case 30 fps. i.e 1 frame runs in 33.34ms). \r\n\r\nCurrently 300000 ray-tracing are done per second (including horizontal and vertical). at 30 fps, 10000 ray-tracing is done per frame.

In my opinion, this is a bug since `sort` unexpectedly reduces the filtered result. This is especially annoying when using `CouchDB` together with [PouchDB][2] because the latter works as expected (also returns documents with missing attributes).\r\n\r\nAdding the missing attribute to existing documents as suggested in a comment above may solve your problem. In many cases however (i.e. for number and boolean attributes), it&#39;s not a viable solution because the document content may be falsified. \r\n\r\nThe **short answer** to your question: In many cases, there&#39;s no straight forward `CouchDB` way to fix this. \r\n\r\n**UPDATE:**\r\n\r\nIt&#39;s interesting that similar product `Couchbase Server` addresses this issue - for full text search results - by allowing for [fine-grained control over the sort-procedure][3] through the `missing` field.  \r\n\r\n&gt; **missing**: Specifies the sort-procedure for documents with a missing\r\n&gt; value in a field specified for sorting.

container should create a card should contain 2 5 in the same way it shown in attached fig(there they have some other values),\r\n\r\nand if I again pressed add with giving some other value i.e 4 and 6 , so in above container it should create another card with content as 4 6 next to first card, so when I keeps on clicking add it should create cards in First container in row wise , (rounded

Default is all fields. Restrict this for example to avoid unwanted modifications by\r\n&gt; malicious users when binding HTTP request parameters.&quot;*\r\n\r\nWhich means that by default all fields are allowed. If you don&#39;t want to allow all fields, then you can specify the allowed fields in this method.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for the [`setDisallowedFields`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DataBinder.html#setDisallowedFields-java.lang.String...-): \r\n\r\n&gt; *&quot;Register fields that should not be allowed for binding. Default is none. Mark fields as disallowed for example to avoid unwanted\r\n&gt; modifications by malicious users when binding HTTP request\r\n&gt; parameters.&quot;*\r\n\r\nWhich means that by default no field is disallowed. If you want to disallow some of the fields, then you can specify the disallowed fields in this method.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nSo the answer to your question is that `setAllowedFields()` will automatically disallow the non-specified fields, but `setDisallowedFields()` will not automatically allow the non-specified fields (unless you didn&#39;t include them in `setAllowedFields()` too).\r\n\r\nTo support my answer, let me include the Spring&#39;s implementation of [`isAllowed`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/validation/DataBinder.html#isAllowed-java.lang.String-): \r\n\r\n\tprotected boolean isAllowed(String field) {\r\n\t\tString[] allowed = getAllowedFields();\r\n\t\tString[] disallowed = getDisallowedFields();\r\n\t\treturn ((ObjectUtils.isEmpty(allowed) || PatternMatchUtils.simpleMatch(allowed, field)) &amp;&amp;\r\n\t\t\t\t(ObjectUtils.isEmpty(disallowed) || !PatternMatchUtils.simpleMatch(disallowed, field)));\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nYou can clearly see that if a field is present in `allowedFields` and not present in `disallowedFields` only then it will be allowed.
